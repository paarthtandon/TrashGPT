<SPEAKER_05> (lips smacking) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hate when you do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It sounds disgusting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (lips smacking) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the sound of my thighs when I run. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (lips smacking) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is this how girls feel when
they hear the word moist? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (lips smacking) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh God. It makes me feel dirty. Stop it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (relaxed music) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Welcome to this episode
of the Trash Tastes podcast, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where we talk about not anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but we might talk about
anime today actually so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who knows, who knows, if,
are we feeling spicy today? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - We'll never tell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I might bring up anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and then immediately
tangent from who knows? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who knows? Not even
we do, most of the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> What are we going to talk about? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like a themed episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I did, I did think what I
was going to talk about today </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I was the host I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Connor. You have to think about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "what we're going to talk about." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Go on then.
- Go on then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What, what do you want to talk about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, I will talk about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you want to introduce us,
by the way? We're the boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I'm not introducing you.
They know who you are by now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> We're on episode 49. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> They should know who you are, nearly 50. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But yeah no, so a few weeks ago </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I watched the JoJo event. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course you did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course I did, where
part six was announced, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was great.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is why everyone watched
it because they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Will part six get announced? Who knows?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But imagine if they
didn't announce part six </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after all that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it would have been very sad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I should fully explain
if you're not a JoJo fan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't worry, do need to explain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Basically there's a
whole event around JoJo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They didn't say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they were going to announce
a new anime adaptation, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but everyone was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "They said, it's the biggest
event in JoJo history." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I think they're going to announce it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Otherwise, I don't think
this is the biggest event. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do they normally do JoJo events, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just randomly out of the blue? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've, I never heard of one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This has been planned
for a very long time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A year ago. I think actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have they done one before this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like they have, but then, then, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then if you go to
YouTube and you type in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> JoJo live on TV, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they just probably constantly
get the voice actors to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of what they did in this event. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I guess I'll walk you
guys through the event, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically what happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause I didn't get to watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't get to watch it
either. I just saw the reaction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - So, yeah. The reactions
we'll get into that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay.
- It was fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> First of all, the event, we
weren't really told anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So you didn't know anything
that was happening. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> All we knew is that
there was a $40 price tag </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor exhales) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to watch the live stream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, it was pay-per-view. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pay-per-view. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 40 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is a, little steep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Eat your heart out Jake Paul. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And we were, yeah right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> YouTube boxing match JoJo event please. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But it was yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so it was a pay-per-view and
we weren't told anything before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we were just told it's going to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the biggest event in
JoJo history add an echo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> add a reverb to that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - As if they don't say
that for every event. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know how they are in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like they hype things
out way beyond belief. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah of course.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Again, we weren't told anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So essentially what happened
was is that they did like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of like a game show kind of thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the start with some
of the voice actors. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> So every main character Joseph. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you don't know JoJo,
don't really worry about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not important. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Basically the voice
actors, they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they quizzed them about the show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's kind of like meh game show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's basic Japanese
TV variety kinda thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah yeah. It was
basically like Family Feud </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but with the JoJo characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which actually sounds
really good actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can make that. I want to watch that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How well did you do in the quiz? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well I did, I did. We'll
get into this actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then, you know, it was like cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And the voice actors performed
some of their scenes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which was like the best part, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know, they would do, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they would all do the most dramatic scene </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from their respective part of the show, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is really good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. And then in the
end they announced it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and it went over the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was supposed to be a two hour event </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and my God did they talk a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They very much, there wasn't
like a, like fast, it was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's just talk about the
show. Talk about the scenes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How did the scenes make
you feel? Tell us about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And yeah it was fine. It was fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But there's a few things that were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> noteworthy about the event. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> First of all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> is that the subtitles were
unusable, unreadable. Awful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why is that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So in this, I said
this was a live event. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - But a live event that was pre-broadcast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like pre-recorded. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. It was all, yeah
not broadcast. Sorry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Pre-recorded totally, it was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not sure if it was
intentionally going to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it's a live playback in a word. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a live re, replaying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - They basically just made
a YouTube premiere. Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean that's basically it right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was edited like a
live Japanese TV show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it was very minimal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess, minimal in terms of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Japanese editing and stuff on screen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, next time we do a
Trash Taste special with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> We've got to make that
pay-per-view now man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We do. We should do
pay. What do we do man? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> We're fucking dumb.
Just giving it for free, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what?
- What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's self-funded? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. We're
fucking, we're schmucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Losing out on our money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah it was, it was, it was $40. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Which, you know for a live event </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a bit
- A bit hefty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean you can buy
a whole season of JoJo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on DVD for that or something, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You could buy four episodes
of a JoJo on Blu-ray for that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And don't get me wrong.
The event was very good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was very well-made
but it was just tragic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how many events charge
$40 for you to watch them? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not a lot. Well I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe like a concert of
like a mid ranged artists </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> is like $40, right? But. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Online though? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, not online. Like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like a, I feel like boxing
events are the only thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like boxing ones
are the only ones that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe wrestling? Although, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not like a, I don't watch wrestling, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but those are the ones I
think of when it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah usually it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're paying 40 bucks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to it's, it's an
in-person experience. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Most of the time I would like to think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But with boxing as well,
they do it online as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's always like a fucking 80 bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I feel like with boxing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's different to a lot of
sporting, other sporting events </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because people like you're
building up months and months, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to this one moment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whereas other things like
football or basketball </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like constant matches
throughout a season. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But with boxing you have one event </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that people build up
months to. And that's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I can, I can understand
the pay-per-view price </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or that model kind of
in that kind of sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Boxing fans are hardcore as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is where I think like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do I not understand the
Japanese market enough? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I'm like, is this like
the same level as of like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> international boxing event in
Japan, like this JoJo event? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it like the same level of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone, everyone's
stopping what they're doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well you know JoJo fans are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. But I wonder, I wonder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if this is like, is this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the price is this high because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they're banking on JoJo fans
being as dedicated as they are, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> which they are. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Or is it that they think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's that big of an event
in general in Japan? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know.
- I mean, I feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not used to Japanese
business model period </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I feel like it's the only country </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that can sell Blu-rays for
like hundreds of dollars </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for like four episodes sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - For a special edition and
people here will still buy it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. And watching
this live event was fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause the live tweets were
quite, quite interesting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> People were not very happy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - On the English side. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was really, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was really, yeah, on the English side. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was really interesting seeing how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> all the negativity got wiped away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the moment that like
part six was announced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everyone was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Guys, guys. It's worth it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> "It was, the event was worth it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Two hours of shit songs. I sleep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So yeah essentially
right. The, again, it was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it was pre-recorded so this
could have been subtitled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like properly. It's not, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can get budget subtitles
and translations done </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for this kind of length. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you know, we get
subtitles done for the podcast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think, to get the podcast captioned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like $150 an episode. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But if you wanted to translate it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think it would be into Japanese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> for like an episode like this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I think is around
the same length is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe like 800 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's not, in terms of a big business, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 800 bucks for that kind of thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like low-end translating.
Probably not that much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But instead they decided
for some reason to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> auto-generated subtitles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's never a good sign. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was like, there was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people were just posting
screenshots of the subtitles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like, "I'm going to
kill a kid or something." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was one of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or something like really
funny out of context. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it was just really, really bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the point where it was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this is unwatchable if you
don't know any Japanese, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like the subtitles are
so bad. And it was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just wondered why, like,
this is such a good event. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you have, if you're a JoJo fan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this event was amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like this is the kind of stuff
that if it was on YouTube, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it has like 5 million views guaranteed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm wondering like,
do you think they even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> thought about the international
audience or were they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just really
- No of course not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - marketing towards the Japanese audience? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think they were. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause you like, even me living in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I only heard about it like the day before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's because you
fucking posted about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I did not know, like this
wasn't talked about at all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> on my timeline, at least. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I didn't know about it
until just as it was happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - If this was an event right? Where they, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was only really able,
you're only able to pay in yen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You were only able to buy
from a Japanese website. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would. I would be like,
that's a fair argument. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, you went on
the Japanese website, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you went out of your way
to pay in the currency and. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're expected to listen
to it in Japanese. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You knew what you were getting into. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> For some super fans, if they
don't understand a word, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But for me it was like, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So the premiering, the
sharing like, Singapore, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> US specifically, they
have a website in English, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're charging you in dollars </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're telling you
that going to be subtitled. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Think it's kind of fucked up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Like again, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the event was great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's just so sad that they kind of, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like they mislead the people a bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, well absolutely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, when have automated
subtitles ever worked? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They barely work for captioning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The language that they're doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They barely work for our own language </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when we upload it on YouTube, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's auto-subtitles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like what were they thinking? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's been known to be one
of the hardest languages </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to translate into English. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Completely different grammatically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think in terms of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a cost per like, like
per minute of translating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Japanese to English is
one of the most expensive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not surprised by that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because it's the hardest.
And then there's not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> there's not many people that can do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's grammatically
completely different as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right so then who decided
that this should be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> this is a great idea and we're
going to charge $40 for this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I, I would
think for a $40 price, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you would get like more
professional subtitles. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 100% percent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I, cause I guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the first I'm hearing about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But like when I hear live
events, I think, you know, you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you understand there's some
leeway in an actual live event </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's happening right as it's airing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But if it was pre-recorded
then yeah I mean you could've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> dumped the subtitles.
- Yeah. there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing about this show
that needed to be live. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There is no aspect of it that
required a live audience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. If it's prerecorded
then like it's not like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not like the host can
interact with the chat or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> anything like that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you're telling me you paid $40 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just to see a part six announcement. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'd do it again Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - JoJo fans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - JoJo </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - JoJo fans in a nutshell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pay for something I would have gotten </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like five minutes later
anyway but, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. I, you know,
I sat down and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "This isn't worth the $40". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just the subtitles, the subtitles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just, it's like, you
know, at what point is it like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> do I need a refund? You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like how bad do the subtitles
have to be where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't understand
anything that's being said. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I mean, I think that's
worthy of a refund, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you, you paid for
something that you didn't even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they didn't even
like give you the chance </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> to try and understand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's really unfortunate as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because people were like
dogging on them on Twitter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the JoJo anime account
tweeted out, being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey guys", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> because there was a lot of
people streaming it on Twitch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they were like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Guys, please don't pirate it there". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then there was one, this is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like as a company, you
should never ever say this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You should never ever say the words, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "There is no excuse to
pirate" because I guarantee </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> within 10 seconds, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's going to be 10 people
with 10 semi-decent reasons </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why they pirated it. So for example, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and this is terrible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So the show was only
available in the US, Singapore </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I think a few other Asian countries. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No Europe, no Europe at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right? No, none of the other
American countries, nothing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not even, not even Canada. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not even Canada. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So they were like, in
this tweet, they said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "There is no excuse to pirate this thing". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And then in brackets they said, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Sorry for the territory limitations". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm thinking like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What is? What?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what is it? What is a
European fan supposed to do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every European just unanimously is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - As a European, what am I supposed to do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Tell me what I'm supposed to do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just be born better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just be born in a
better country. Obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously, come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Obviously I'm not, I'm
not promoting piracy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but there is a way as a company </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where that you can word
things or go about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just fly to Asia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you can watch it from
Asia during a pandemic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just live in Japan. It's easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You like anime. Just live in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just, it's so
frustrating. Cause it feels like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it feels like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You get shafted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, I feel like companies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should already have a understanding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that like territory limitations.
I like, I, in my opinion, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the biggest reason why people pirate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's, it's been like this since </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking the internet
was invented basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Like lost media. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I firmly believe, you know,
you should be able to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if it's abandonware, or, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> or completely lost and there's
no, you know, honestly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's okay to pirate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I, I don't why would that not be okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No one has a stake in this anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's literally history. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like isn't like PlayStation or Sony </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> shutting down the PS3, PSP
and PS Vita stores now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like, you know, even
though, even though like I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, I, cause I own, I own a PS Vita. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And when I heard that I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> "Shit. What if there's a game
that I want on the PS Vita, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "I don't know what it is now", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like, I'm not going
to be able to obtain it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just lost media now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And if you're not going to
make it readily available, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then someone's going to
archive this, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I, it's, it's, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a, it's a gray area, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I feel like there is, you know, there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there is a reason why
people do want to pirate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and do want to like archive this stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You know I mean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's definitely a, like,
it's not a matter of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, there's no excuse to pirate" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "No, there really is an excuse to pirate" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's literally the only way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll ever be able to
get a hand on it. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it's like, if you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you would get someone who gets
into your product who never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would have been able to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and never would have
had a chance to. Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And again with this
live stream, it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> why is this live stream
only in some countries? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, is it because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're perhaps showing
scenes from the anime? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is it probably a license?
Ah, probably is actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's probably a licensing
thing, but still it's like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a live stream, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it's not like you
can't get it in every country. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like that kind of
mentality just hasn't adapted to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just how the internet works </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just how the community
works now in 2021 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or even fucking 2010. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] 'Cause all the laws
are just completely outdated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and copyright law is just fucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All laws are completely outdated because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they are all laws that are made for like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> television broadcasts and
stuff like that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Especially in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Especially in Japan.
It just wasn't designed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, we don't even
have fair use laws here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> which is ridiculous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I mean, it's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like at least in the
US there is a mentality of, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> technically, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> live streaming a game and not
paying the, the, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> for a license to do that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> It's technically, you
know, legally speaking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you're not allowed to do that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But all the US companies
just kind of agreed, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's beneficial, let them do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I feel like that kinda
thing doesn't really happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> There's not a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's not really a
thing of it's beneficial, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so let them do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, it's just another, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like when you get events like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just reminded that, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're another one of those anime fans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> being a westerner that yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> They don't care about you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I mean, I feel
like the mentality is slowly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, it took this long for it to change </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> with like Western companies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so God knows how long it's going to change </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with Japanese companies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is changing at a fucking
snail's pace, that's for sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I like, I would say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> at least Japanese companies
know that we exist now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's, that's, that's the
biggest difference, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because imagine like five
years ago where they had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a American or they had like
an English site to promote </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a Japanese live stream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know we, we are
taking very small steps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We've gone from snail
mail to dial up email. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's been it's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's interesting because
it's almost similar to how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Japanese games are brought
over here. Right, like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Here? I'm in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - To the west. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah Japanese games
were brought to the west, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but I feel like the, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the whole way the gaming
industry has gone. It's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like decades ahead
of where the anime is at. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I wonder if that's because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they kind of grew at the same time, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the culture of gaming
in America was its own thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And the culture of gaming
in Japan was its own thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they kind of grew together
benefiting each other, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like they send games to each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I wonder if that's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if that's the reason why that
industry went so fast and why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes people can't even
tell if a game is from Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I think it's
also because like, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like American games now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like now they're making games
in America and in Europe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Whereas like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel the anime industry
won't do that until we get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dedicated people who are
making it in America, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> making it in Europe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause. I, I guess when maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when the Japanese businessman in like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> eighties or nineties
were making video games, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh yeah, there's tons of
gaming in the US. Let's go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Send our products over there". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Whereas it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, there's no anime there. Let's not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Let's not bother doing anything". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would also say that
from my perspective, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like the anime
industry has always been like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in my opinion like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of like 10 years or so
behind the gaming industry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like 20 sometimes now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 10 to 20 years in terms
of the popularity and how, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, how, how big the industry is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because I like, gaming
right now is probably the most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> mainstream medium, entertainment medium </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there is now, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Gamers? Sorry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Rise up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Gaming makes more
than movies now, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So gaming right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well 'cause you can't
put microtransactions </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> in a fucking movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's true. That's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't roll for your gacha
in the middle of "Parasite", </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Would you like to watch
the rest of this movie? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> $5 please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like, I would say
like within our lifetime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we've seen gaming. We've
seen gamers rise up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to become, the most biggest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> entertainment medium in
the world now, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - When are weebs gonna rise up man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It used to be used to be movies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now do I think anime is going
to become as big as gaming? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, but I would say that anime right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is also rising up. Weebs rise up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's on its way. It's on its way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's on its way. It's
getting more popular. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But then isn't it weird though, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I feel like all the money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the weebs have is being
siphoned off in anime games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. That is true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I bet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Anime games and Vtubers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I bet, I bet weebs spend
way more on anime games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> than they do on anime merch and anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, 100%. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 100%
- 100% </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So all the weeb stuff.
All the weeb money, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there're just going in the fucking games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's going to the gaming industry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's going to the gaming industry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It all comes back to the
games. I mean, I feel like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> probably if, if, if you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you interviewed like the
average anime fan, like not, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not, not the average anime fan, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the average weeb I would say, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the average person in the weeb culture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They probably spend
more money on like games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like VTubers than they
do on an actual like anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like a figurine or a manga
or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. No, absolutely. 100%. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's, it's weird how that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just the way
weebs work, but that's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what I felt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I feel weebs put
most of their money into. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe like, maybe in 2020, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe it's because there haven't
been like anime conventions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> or things, other things they can buy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I would say that
the more I watch anime, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the less I buy like figurines
and stuff like that, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you, do you feel like, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're a hardcore JoJo fan, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So you, you, you put a lot of
your money into JoJo merch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah invest in JoJo stock. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but now, but now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you look for like the most
exclusive stuff, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't just buy like
the cheap casual thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No I don't, if the figure
is under like 50 bucks, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "I'm not interested". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like that's peasant
stuff, get that out of here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause those figures are also cheap. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And also when you realize </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you start collecting
a lot of figures, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the one thing that becomes
more valuable than the figures </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the room they take up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So then you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right now I have to decide </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "which figures are worthy of the display". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. So I'm like slowly
starting to do that too with like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exclusively paintings or
like limited merch items </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure that sounds so fucking uh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It sounds so fucking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm so wealthy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, I'm an art collector. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you do you, when you
do start collecting figures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you start getting a lot you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "You know this $5 Goku figure, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I kinda can't argue, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it deserves the same spot as
his $200 hand sculpted Rem </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking like DNA
engraved, you know, thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like not, not even figurines
though, but like every, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anytime I go to an anime
convention or stuff like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd much rather buy shit
from the Artist Alley </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and things that independent
artists are doing. Because, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most of the time they make cooler stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than the official
figures most of the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or the official
merchandise, it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't understand people
who go to anime conventions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and they buy buttons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> To me, buttons, buttons are
the stickers for me, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like the metallic
ones right? Right yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hate buttons man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Japan is fucking obsessed with those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know. I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whenever I go to like
a pop-up shop for like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you, you hear, you hear
an announcement where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, there's a pop-up shop
for like X anime series </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or Y anime series. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember the first
few times I thought, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Wow, cool. They got
exclusive merch there". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, 90% of
them are just buttons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And to me, like buttons
are the merch you buy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you don't, when you can't commit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to buying an actual merchandise. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what buttons are to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's when you have that
chump change in your pocket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and go, "I can pay for this yeah". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah it's like the
equivalent of, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> when you go abroad and you're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, I guess I gotta
buy a souvenir, right?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You go to Paris and
you go and you go like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Ah, I guess I gotta buy like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> "fucking Eiffel Tower key ring." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It's literally the
equivalent of like, I was here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like I was at that pop-up store, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here is physical proof that
I was at that pop-up store, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a 500 yen shitty like
can, like tin can thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But then they gatchafy it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you can't even buy the one you want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You have to buy like 500 fucking buttons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> until you get the one you want. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - There are people though
that I see that have, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, the whole bags. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Their entire bag or their entire like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> denim jacket or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like covered
in them. And they just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they sound like a fucking festival. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why would you put a bunch
of barnacles on your clothes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> as far as I'm concerned, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what, that's what it looks like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It looks like it looks ugly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It's ugly, and I won't stand for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. No, people like it
man, I don't know what to say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - One thing, one thing
about the JoJo event though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I wish that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wish that anime did have
more of these kinds of events. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I will say like one thing that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> always makes me jealous as an anime fan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from watching, you know,
the gaming community, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that having this live event where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they have like a load of things
announced at once, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I've always been. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh you want an E3 of anime? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I kind of do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would love the presentations. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Check this out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, half the fun of
E3 is just feeling like it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like what feeling
like you're part of a community </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and just watching it and
just reacting to it, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause like, 'cause like to me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the closest thing anime has </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like the Anime Awards, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But we don't really have any like, what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just the mental image right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just the thought of just
of some guy coming up like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Guys I'm proud to announce,
"Incest the Anime". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> "Me, me and the team at Incest Anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "have worked really hard", like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - This time, this time in 8K. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Most anime I do not want to know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the thought process as
to why this came to be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I do not want to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you want, do you want? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do not want some 50
year old man telling me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why he thinks this 12 year old girl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> should fuck this 20 year old man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to see a
presentation of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That is the last thing I want. And I also. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We hear you. Guys, we hear you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You guys want more sister-fucking right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Last time we heard that the plot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> got in the way of the incest. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So we decided to just go to Bang Bros. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We upgraded that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Guys, we hear you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You want another isekai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just imagined it like, check this out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The fucking PornHub,
the fucking thing plays. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor mimics PornHub's beat) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my gosh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But do you like care </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about most of the games
that get announced, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you wait for that one JoJo
part six announcement, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you wait for. I don't
know what, what else? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that we should
get more live events </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to announce anime just
for the hype factor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it makes sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no. That's what I miss. I want, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like the hype factor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in that the gaming
community have, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's, I, I feel like it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it adds to this community
aspect and it adds to the fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, Japan kind of has that already. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Do they? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah on Niconico, they have
this event called SUZUKIMI, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which I did the English
version of at AX last time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But yeah, it's, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> it's literally like a live
event where they get a bunch of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like voice actors and hosts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to announce the next season of anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe they should subtitle this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe you could subtitle it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like imagine how hype it
would be when you like you hear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a "Chainsaw Man" adaptation is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> instead of seeing it on Twitter, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You have this event where you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, it's fucking", you
know, it's the next. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The teaser trailer. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah yeah the teaser
trailer where you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, is this "Chainsaw Man"? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Is this like, "Jujutsu Kaisen" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> before they just got
animated. You know like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like they just play like
scenes of the anime like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "YEAAH!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "YOOO!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There are some manga series
I know people are waiting for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like imagine like one day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Vagabond" gets announced
or some shit like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would, I'd lose my shit, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it would be cool if
anime had this kind of event </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where we just announced a
bunch of new anime getting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting adapted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why, we should do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Honestly, like we're saying this idea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, no one's going to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Anime companies reach out to us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah please we'll do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just feels hard
being an anime fan you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck we just, we spend, we
spend a fuckton of money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We get, we get beat down on, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck man, it's hard when
you're not Japanese. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like people watching
award shows, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because, okay, here's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Nobody actually watches
an award show to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> see who wins or to like
congratulate the winners. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We watch it to get salty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and to feel like we're
part of a conversation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like a sporting event? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. Yeah it is kinda
like a sporting event for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like entertainment, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, that's, that's why
people watch, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the Anime Awards, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the Gaming Awards and also
like the Oscars as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which apparently just aired yesterday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Nobody watched. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At the time of recording. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At the time of recording. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't know it aired
until the day after </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Dude the Oscars aired?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No one said anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I only knew about it because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I saw a tweet of some guy who like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put down a list of the past 10
years worth of like viewers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And apparently it was like
the lowest in, I think ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it had halved in one year, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's also because
we didn't really have any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> big theatrical releases this year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean we really didn't
really have any movies in 2020. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Most movies went to HBO
Max or Netflix or whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And also I feel that I didn't
realize now until this year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh my God, all those ads
that these movies pay for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and all the, like the
promotional tools and whatnot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really do work. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I don't know anything about movies </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> unless they're doing these
like promotional tours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah, same here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I haven't heard, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't heard of like
a single really big movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that came out in 2020, obviously because. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I only know about the Snyder cut </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because that was like a meme
because it was four hours long. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Snyder cut was probably the biggest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was a re-release. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think the only movie
I watched last year, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> not even in cinemas, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but like afterwards was "Tenet". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah I watched "Tenet" in theaters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> That's really good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't even watch that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So fucking good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know. I heard so many people saying, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, it was great". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the most Nolan
movie you can ever imagine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. It's very much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm okay with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's almost as if "South
Park" wrote a parody </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of a Christopher Nolan
film and then they made it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, do you know what the
main character is called? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, tell me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's called the Protagonist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I shit you not, the main character </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is just called the Protagonist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> He doesn't have a name.
He's called the Protagonist, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a fucking Nishio Ishin hole. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude, the fucking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even if the story is kind of dumb, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like the visuals in that
movie are so fucking cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so good. And also Robert
Patterson, I fucking love, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think he's an amazing actor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I will watch anything's he's in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, he's fucking great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I feel like watching
"Tenet" and I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Nolan's obviously just
given up on the script. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He just has a lot of
cool ideas for visuals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the visuals were fucking cool, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I pay attention to the plot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the character for a
second. And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What the fuck is going
on right now?", you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Watching it in the movies
was like so exhausting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was literally that
I was posing like this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's backwards in time. Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's pretty good. It's pretty good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's fun. It was one of those movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that I couldn't imagine watching at home. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like the big screen helped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I watched it at home. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It took me like, it took me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it took me two times to
watch because the first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just got really, really
bored in the first half. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In the first half. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because the first half is all plot. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They had us in the first half. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause like, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not following what's going on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I really don't care about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like, I sleep until
Robert Patterson comes on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and like, I'm paying attention.
All right, what's up? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> He's so good. I love him in everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's a fantastic guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's so fucking good. Have
you watched "The Lighthouse"? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I've seen that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love "The Lighthouse". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's "The Lighthouse"? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a movie with him and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> who's the guy played Jesus Christ? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Um fuck, what is his name? I, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - William DaFoe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ryuk. Who can forget
his famous reel of Ryuk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in "Death Note" live-action. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The famous four lines
he said in that movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah William DaFoe is
a fucking amazing actor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're both in it and
they're both going crazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fucking amazing. I won't
spoil it. Go and watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kind of an artsy
film, but it's really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really, really good.
You should watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> How many films do you watch? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Not many. Maybe, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You probably go to the cinemas though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the most out of all of us though, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. But I don't care
what I watched at the movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How do you not care
about what you watch? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is a stimulus in my eyes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, we'll come back to the Oscars. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> We'll talk about that. But yeah. Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I enjoy just the
experience of the theater. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I like the, I like the popcorn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I like the fact that I can,
so I can ignore my phone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So how often did you
watch films at home? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ohh. Never. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because you're mostly just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a Netflix
- Netflix, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kinda guy. Because I'm like,
I'm the complete opposite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I only go to the cinemas if I know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a banger film I need to watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If not I'm just like, I
just watch it at home. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pre, pre-Rona. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was going like maybe once a week, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe once every two weeks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Damn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - because it was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's always something on and
they would always do reruns. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I, I watched in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I watched "The Shawshank Redemption". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In cinemas? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In cinemas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Isn't that weird? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why don't we just
not watch that at home? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just, why not? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never got to watch it at the big screen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's go and have a look.
The best film of all time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> according to IMDB. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why would I not want to
experience it on the big screen? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean it's a great
film. Don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a fantastic film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you can also watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I also don't feel bad if
I want to go and get more, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, drinks and popcorn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I've already seen it like
10 times. Yeah, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So what you're saying is
you just want the popcorn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I really, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You wanna eat popcorn in a big room. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you not, can you
not eat popcorn at home? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, not really. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I legitimately don't go to the movies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the theater now because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they don't sell popcorn in
the 'Rona. I don't want to go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not because there's a
pandemic. Just no popcorn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well they're not selling
that because of the pandemic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But if they let's say the
pandemic was still on, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would very much socially distance. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can sneak some fucking popcorn in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't want to bring my popcorn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I want their popcorn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You want the overpriced
popcorn, fucking popcorn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually, it's reasonably
priced in Japan at least. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I do not want to go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure there's someone
out there who agrees. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I do not want to go to the fucking cinema </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if I'm not getting popcorn, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not it's I just don't want it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think I've ever
bought popcorn in the cinemas. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll literally, legitimately
go to a restaurant before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll be full as fuck. I'll be
like gagging at how full I am. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'll be like, "One
large popcorn please." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know what's going on. Ooooh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll literally be dying. I do not care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I have to get popcorn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What I don't understand, is some people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like some of, some of my
friends who, you know, we, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we go to the movies or
we'll go to the cinema </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's at this awkward time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like 1:00 or 1:30. You know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm getting popcorn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's just like,
do you eat lunch before? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Or do you not eat lunch before? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Before, before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And some people were just
like, the popcorn is my lunch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, how the
fuck is popcorn lunch? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Popcorn is not anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm pretty sure you can't
even live off popcorn now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not, it's not a meal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. Pretty sure it's negative calories. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Am I right? Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It feels like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you kind of just eating, air right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - One time in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I spilled my popcorn over the floor and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that ruined
the whole movie for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that legitimately made my whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So did you spill it during the movie or? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What was the movie
that you were watching? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Before it started. I don't even know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't remember I was just so, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was literally distraught </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for the first 40 minutes of the film. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was actually just so sad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well don't buy popcorn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was genuinely when
it, when it fell over, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know when you're so sad
about something bad happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You just sit there for like 10 seconds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just let it soak about
how sad you are, you're like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - All around me are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Like you know when you break, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like you drop your phone and
it smashes you'll go like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh my God". You're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor exhaling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You kinda just stare at it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> You don't even go to
pick it up immediately. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're just so overwhelmed
with emotions and sadness </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you just stand there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah no, I get that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And like I had that moment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I get that feeling, but
not when I drop popcorn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's, it's whenever I drop any kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> food item or drink item I've just bought. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's something, I've
broken my phone before, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I've broken expensive items. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's something
that just hurts so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> about dropping food or drink on the floor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It can't be matched.
- There's nothing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's nothing that hurts me more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> than buying a fresh pint and then like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then just like immediately dropping it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or like upon it just falling off the tray </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as you're taking it to the table, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I'd rather
drop my first born child </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than my popcorn. If I'm
completely honest with you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mainly 'cause I have Meilyne laughing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - At least you can pick it back up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, the baby can
take a hit, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm pretty sure I took a many hits. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> My popcorn doesn't take a
hit. I can't eat that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right now especially if you pick that up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone will look at you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - As much as I would want to pick up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know a part of me is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> is the top layer of the popcorn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the floor okay at least? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Can I at least scoop some of it back in? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - At least it's not directly touching it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like how much of
this popcorn has fallen out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not gonna lie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I want to say that I'm
hygienic. But if I see if, if. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Meilyne] You're not! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Shut the fuck up. If like, let's say. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a bunch of nachos fell on the floor, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would be tempted to just be like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, not nachos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Nachos is where I draw the line man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would be tempted to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would be tempted to be
like, the bottom layer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is cushioned.
- Scrape off the top. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is cushioned. Is cushioned.
I will grab the top left. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I would eat that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, ugh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I would eat that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like popcorn comes in pieces, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because popcorn, you can
scrape off the top layer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So you could scrape off the layer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you can get the bucket
that you have with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would put, maybe I would like kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shuffle some of the top ones back in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If they were, if they were in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thought you floated up slightly so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, tilt it 40 degree angle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and see what I can like scoop
back in from the top layer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Nachos for me, it's a little too wet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nachos is way too wet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like chili, I
spilled chili on the floor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Start grabbing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Scrape the top layer. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like french fries right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's say all the french
fries fell on the floor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> A part of me would be tempted to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, the top 40% of these
french fries. Perfectly fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. No, no. Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Imma start grabbing them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay 'cause one, okay
so there are two factors. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm gonna sound so vile to some people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I'm the same. I'm the same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, there are two
factors you need to consider. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> One, what is the ground?
Is it like a clean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - What is the ground? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No no, because if it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Carpet.
- Clean carpet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Carpet is the worst. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Carpet is the worst because
you've got like all shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like, you got all the dust and shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you drop it on the street
floor, that's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Game over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Rest in peace. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is game over. You have
to say goodbye right there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wood laminate flooring? Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Maybe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe we can salvage most of this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Secondly you need to consider, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what is the food item that
you've just dropped? Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Is, is it liquid? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know how, how, how
viscous is this food item? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You need to get a straw. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, like popcorn. It
comes in little pieces. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can just, you can just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> scoop off the bottom layer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and just leave that on the
floor and just like it's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like the safety layer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have like the bottom layer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then the safety layer, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just in case any of
anything on the second layer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> touch the floor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - In case the germs have
like made its way up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Once you drop a
chocolate bar on the floor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> do you just like pick
it up and scrape it off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all the dirt? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Chocolate bar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Chocolate bar. Honestly
it depends like it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get a rinse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - it's a solid piece of food. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So it depends on the
floor that its touched. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I treat it like an NES
cartridge. I just kinda blow on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just blow off the dust. It's like, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's good enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've got an immune system for a reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - One week later. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> We have the 'Rona and what went wrong? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wouldn't do it now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like during high
school, like if I, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like dropped a sandwich,
for example, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like depending on how it landed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if the sandwich
perfectly lands on the ground, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that bottom piece of bread, RIP. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You'll take everything else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're tearing that piece
off. Let's be honest right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm taking everything else on top of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not wasting food, fuck that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No I kinda like how
you suddenly went from, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, eww. Disgusting." to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Wait, maybe. Wait maybe
there's a situation". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't want to waste food, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The point is I would
rather drop my child. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> TLDR. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - TLDR.
- TLDR. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm pretty sure my parents dropped me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm pretty sure I'm, I'm fine. Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think there's a single parent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who didn't drop their child. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Come on now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is what, this is why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I am terrified of holding a child. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think I've actually, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think I've, in my
30 years of being alive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think I've properly
held a baby in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen people in Japan
where they're on their bikes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They have the kid in
the carriage behind them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and they have the kid
in the backpack on them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, this is just, this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] That's hard mode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is an accident waiting to happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it feels sketch as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which ever way you
fall, you are cushioning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - God Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just kidding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, that's
why I never understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of my family members
has a baby or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they deadass look
me in the eye and go, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Do you want to hold this baby?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Why would you trust? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "So why would you trust a
literal life in my hands?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I don't trust myself to hold that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Does this thing come with a
fucking instruction manual? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like how do I operate this thing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I always wonder like,
like I'm like, how do you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You kinda like cup it, isn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you kinda like
take it from the bottom? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - As somebody who has many
pictures of me holding babies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I can tell you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, do you take it from the bottom? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Or like under the arm? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you do it like this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you like kind of like rest them like this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know how do it now. But
like when I was like 14, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who told you how to do it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I had no one's ever told me
how to properly hold a baby. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just maternal instincts isn't it now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Trial by fire. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Trial by fire. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Many babies are sacrificed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I used to grab them by
the temple, like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Realized they didn't
like that when I started. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I think, I think because like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I, I'm terrified of it
because every single time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bar none that I've tried to hold a pet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's tried to wriggle out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just thinking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Shit, if this fucking
animal was trying to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "wriggle out of my grasp, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I do not want to hold a human
life in my hands and risk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "dropping a human life on the floor." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Babies don't wriggle.
They just complain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like British people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think I've ever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think I've ever seen a
baby like get held by someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and be like, "Fuck off me". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - "What are you doing?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, "No". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anyway, back to movies. What
were we saying about movies? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The viewership sucked for the Oscars. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That was the overall part. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then again like I feel like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like the Oscars
just can't win right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No matter what they do
that they're going to lose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if they, if they, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if they patent it more
to or change the demo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and focus more on mainstream movies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the movies people are actually watching, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like the whole
integrity of, you know, the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you can't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The artistic integrity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can't fucking give 10
Oscars to Fast and Furious like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as much as you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the fact that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fact that the Harry Potter movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> never got an Oscar for anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the whole movie run, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I do feel it's a bit of a shame </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I do feel during that time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were just kind of shunned. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The fact that they've seen
as just mainstream garbage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I genuinely think that Harry Potter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> could have won in certain areas,
especially like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like set design. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well there was so many times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that Harry Potter could have won an Oscar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and never did. And I feel
like a lot of disdain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was built up during that period where, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I mean, I feel like the Oscars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> just has not aged well as time has gone on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then they got
caught up in the whole, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole woke culture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which I felt like when
you get into that debate, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you've just lost because
you're going to upset someone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Because once you get in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> once you get into the woke culture debate, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> then you lose whatever side you go on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> You lose whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're gonna make
enemies no matter what. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - side you pander on or
even don't pander on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or even if you say nothing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you are still losing, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like that was the start of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really the decline of the Oscars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> along with just the fact that,
it's all kind of the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Along with the fact that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the more years I've watched the Oscars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or the more years I, 'cause I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even like watch
the Oscars that often, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but like more years I've watched it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the more years I realized, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Man, I just don't know
any of these movies". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No you don't. Well, cause
I think they had a few years, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> where there was a lot of
artsy films that were winning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which, you know, I'm
sure they deserve them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I think as a mainstream viewer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> most people fucking
don't know what that is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like what was the, what
was that one movie that I, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I there's a few, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's been a bunch of movies
that just won Best Picture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like Parasite was the first movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that won Best Picture that I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know that movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've seen that movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Good movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> But like a bunch of other
years I've been like, what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> What? What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the problem with
the Oscars for me is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even if something wins Best Picture, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean Parasite was one of
the only Best Movie winners </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I was actually, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like everyone
was happy that it won. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Everyone was happy with
that. That was the first thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When I, when I saw people actually happy, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like mostly unanimously be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Yeah. Parasite deserves it.
It's a fucking great film". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because most of the times </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I see a Best Picture
winner on the Oscars, I watch it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Yeah, this is a, this is a
very much an Oscar movie". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I can see why it's so highly rated, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but I just didn't find it
that interesting personally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is what happened to, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's an institution that
goes on for too long. Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's got all these built up, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> things that they've been doing
for years. Like the whole, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like if you want to be in the Oscars, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you have to do a bunch of dumb shit and, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and hold events for the people doing it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and basically just pay them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pay them out yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pay them to get considered for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And that whole shit is dumb. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> That's not how it should be
done at all. I don't think any, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think anybody wants a system </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where to be included in an award show, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to, there's a, there's
a pay to win essentially. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, obviously you don't pay to win, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you pay to enter. Which I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> why not just make it so that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the best picture gets
nominated for Best Picture? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you literally have to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> win the hearts of the
judge by catering to them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> not by making something good, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like kind of ass backwards. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. And it says something
when I think that like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> somehow, you know, something like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the Crunchyroll Anime
Awards is a better system </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than the Oscars. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they have a mix of like fan vote. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And obviously if you do fan
vote, you can kind of guess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what's gonna happen.
- People are still salty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. But I think having
that kind of fan vote in the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in the equation to say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, this is what the fans are thinking". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just letting you know.
Just letting you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's also by making
a fan voting system, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it gets those fans to
actually watch the show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Right it gets them involved. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it doesn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't think so? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, fans vote for what they watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> They don't vote for every
show that's on the list. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no but what I'm saying is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're more inclined to
actually watch the awards show, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to see who won. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If they vote for it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Definitely, I'd say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - More so than like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah more so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - leaving it to an unknown
committee of people right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "This is the best film. No
one can argue about it". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know how many judges there are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> There's quite a lot. It's
like 500 or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I completely estimated,
maybe Ashley can you check </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> how many Oscar judges there are? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I don't think, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is the exact number known? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not sure, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think having some
form of waiting, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 5% by the fan or just
something like where the fans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can kind of have some form of sway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right like the Game Awards, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, the game, the
Game Awards I feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know the exact number </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I feel like it's like 10% </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like the fan voted part of the awards. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That seems good to me. That's, why not? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - At least we know what
everyone else is thinking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know? Even if, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I feel like the Oscars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is everything I hate about
pretentious Hollywood </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's, it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's putting these people, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's putting this work on
like a fucking pedestal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where an award show should
be just about you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> celebrating what everyone loved
that came out in the year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, it's, it's become like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this whole other political
message and fucking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well yeah and I think
that's what happens when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the weight of an Oscar
becomes what it is. Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you can make your career
off winning an Oscar, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you win one early on, I imagine your, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the amount you just start
charging people for your work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> goes up significantly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's understandable why it
all comes in, but it's just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that's why I've always enjoyed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other kind of award shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like whenever Ricky Gervais
hosts the The Golden Globes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like rich people get roasted 4K. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I'd rather, I'd take that any day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> over the Oscars. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's very good. I do enjoy that. Yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the Oscars is always
the same shit it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "And now for somebody who worked hard, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "there have been struggles and sacrifices, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they worked hard and won the award". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like, great. This is like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - As if everybody is not working hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you could put all the Oscar speeches into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a learning algorithm and
I bet it will predict </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the next speech will be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Auto-generated Oscar acceptance speech. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Generally, like it
feels like it sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know, you got fucking Brad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> because Brad Pitt did the
speech for Best Picture. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh no, it's a Best Actor, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or one of them, I don't
remember which one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And. You know, it's
like, you have Brad Pitt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you give him this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> napkin-esque McDonald's, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> McDonald's like commercial
speech and it's like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why not get them to do something fun? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why don't get them to do something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that'll get people interested, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like actually talk like properly.
I don't know. Just, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just like, I don't
want to fucking watch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a McDonald's ad read. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go on Ashley, how many people
were in the Oscar committee? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Ashley] The academy is made up of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> more than 9,000 voting members. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - All are film-industry professionals. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Most are US-based. And almost
half are active filmmakers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - So roughly 10,000 people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is a lot of people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I do also think if
there is 9,000 people here </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and judging who are
from the film industry, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's also, also kind
of a problem in itself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the people who are
working in the industry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> are the ones who had decided the votes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I guarantee
none of them are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> film critics or anything like that. Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean there might be film critics. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if there's people who
are working on the films </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that are voting, I think that's a problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a bit of a bias happening right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A little bit you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Obviously you might not, I
don't know what the rules are, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean to me, there is no perfect system </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> for like an award show right but. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Either way, the way it is
now isn't working, clearly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Either way, the way it is
now is just not capturing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the public's like, interests. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Interests. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Interests. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also, why isn't it being
live streamed? Come on, Oscars. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> We're in the fucking 21st
century, live stream this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do people watch the Oscars? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Is it pay-per-view? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's on like US TV. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's on TV. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why is it not on fucking
YouTube or Twitch? Come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to PogChamp with the
fucking, could you imagine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Best, Best Supporting Actor, And it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> MonkaS right before it gets
announced. You know? Like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pog! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want that, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like Best Actor Shrek wins the Oscar, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just fucking like Shrek pogs in the chat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, this would be fun as
fuck. Like what are you doing? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> This is great. This is how
you get people into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like if you could, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you could do channel
points like gambling, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause you can do gamble, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I can do, I can do, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Mods mods, do this thing
on my stream". Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "But do this prediction". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like imagine if you can do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I bet so-and-so is going to win. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right when they're
announcing the nomination, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> boom, the prediction comes in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> press your channel points. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? This is like, why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I feel like this
is why the Game Awards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just so much more fun to me to watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as like a viewer than any kind of film, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> film award show or other
kind of award show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can still stick all
the sponsors in. You can, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you can fluff the viewership numbers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause they'll definitely
be higher. You can, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can do so much more like
it just to me it's like, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, it's just the whole system of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just old systems in place that, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have to answer to it
and all this nonsense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Just not bothering
to change the system. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the Oscars has always been that thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's just been on in the background </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and people have talked about it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah, I mean". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - When was the last time you
cared about who won an Oscar? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't even remember. I
don't even fucking remember. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Shrek". "Shrek" winning Best Animated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't even remember
the last time I sat down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to watch the Oscars or the
Grammys or anything like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well you can't. Where
the fuck do you watch it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're you're not American. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, you can watch
it like back in Australia, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but not here anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't even know where
to watch it in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - When was the last time
you cared about a winner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I feel like before "Parasite", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't even, I can't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Shrek. Shrek winning
Best Animated Picture. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the last time I cared, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did it actually? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah it did. "Shrek" won. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well no okay. Best Animated Picture. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like that's a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's either going to be "Shrek" or, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's always Disney or, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's going to be either
Disney or "Shrek". Like wake, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> wake me when an anime actually
wins Best Animated Picture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, "Spirited Away" won right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah that's the only time an anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the only time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's probably the last
time I cared about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And that was like 2006
or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that was 2002 or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Was it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Surprised, "Your Name"
didn't win anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It got nominated though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did it get nominated? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It did get nominated, but
it obviously didn't win. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is so sad. Imagine this, PepeHands. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> They would have lost you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I mean like the anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> anime has always just been
fluffed by the Oscars. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No matter what. I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't it the one year that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Boss Baby" got nominated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> over "A Silent Voice"
- Yeah it did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think as well, I heard that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the only reason why "Spirited Away" won is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like one of the
head people at Pixar, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like really, personally vouched for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I mean, I mean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They also, it got dubbed by Disney. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ghibli is the only thing
that's been noticed by, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no yeah, Ghibli's been the only thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's been noticed by Disney. And, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well because they certainly went, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Holy shit. This is better animated than </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "all of out stuff. What
the fuck? What's going on?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Holy shit. These guys are
still doing 2D animation? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's fucking dedication right there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - TLDR, nobody cares
about the Oscars anymore. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Till they live stream it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and I can do MonkaS. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Live stream it, then
put me on in a week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, honestly I'd watch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> because then people will be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if they let people like
live stream it as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and watch it live, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> man, their viewer
numbers would be massive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And maybe that'll get me to
watch more films as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do, I do want to watch
more films. It's been weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> seeing films released online </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on like HBO max
- I do not like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - and stuff like that. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I think it's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just reaffirmed for me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that I just love the movie theater </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I love the experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and that I hope that it never goes away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No it's great. Like I love
going to it, but it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not like you where I
can just watch anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it needs to be a
movie that I want to watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just enjoy the atmosphere much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that I will go and watch anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like there are some movies that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would prefer to watch in
movie theaters than others. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Tenet" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, sorry? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Tenet" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Tenet" maybe actually, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like that would have been cool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the movie theaters, but
I'd like any action flick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like it would be
better in movie theaters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 100%. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I feel like I
missed out on something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not watching John Wick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well those fucking car scenes in "Tenet" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where they're like going back in time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and zooming forward. It
was so good in the theater. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It was amazing. So good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I need to watch it this week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so good dude, you do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's it's good. Just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just for the visuals and
just because it's by far </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the most visually interesting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> interesting like films I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Super interesting. But yeah. I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I want to watch more movies. I, I just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just really can't watch
movies at home because I, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I put it on, I see that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking two hour thing counting down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "That's a long time". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "That's a long time to focus, damn". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me, to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Spend an hour and a half
watching YouTube videos, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like no questions asked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To me it's, I don't know
some, something about a movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's, it's the commitment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like once I've put some movie on I'll, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll fucking watch it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's, it's bringing myself to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's willing myself to even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put that movie on in the first place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I find trouble with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I'm like, I think to
myself, I'm like, all right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can watch this movie. It's
like an hour and a half. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But at the same time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I could also watch like three
30 minutes YouTube videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I wanted to watch as well, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I could do that. I think
I might prefer that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I could just watch random YouTube videos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for an hour and a half </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that I don't really care about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I could watch like 300 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 20 second meme clips on YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - True, true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been doing a lot of
that recently. Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's, that's all, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's been coming up on my recommended. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know what's going
on with YouTube recently, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they just stopped
recommending YouTube videos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and started recommending
like YouTube shitposts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like Twitter videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah legit. It's so weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I get a recommendation nowadays </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like above a minute, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, this must be a
fucking special video". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What was the one we watched
before we start recording? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Chonk Chart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Chonk Chart. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's my, that's my favorite video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's been recommended recently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is brilliant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But now it's gotten to
the point now, where like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even all the comment sections
can all agree on what, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like everyone is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's got recommended
the same playlist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause everyone's quoting the same videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're quoting a different
video on a different meme video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And everyone gets a reference, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though it's not
on any kind of playlist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well it's like people watch
two hours of Trash Taste </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and not, and they'll be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "No movie for me. Two hour
Trash Taste podcast. Let's go". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh wow. Okay. Thank you. I'm honored. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Thanks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you guys used to watch
more movies back in the day? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - A hundred percent. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. When I was like 15, I loved it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But that was when you discover </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that you can watch things online. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you can tell me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I can watch any movie I
want by just typing the name </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into Google. What the
fuck? Are you for real? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was like a massive
revelation in my life. I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you guys through go through that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> IMDB top 100 movie phase? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah. 100%. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh no, top 250 movie phase. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what the first movie ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've watched illegally was? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was the Hannah Montana movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How'd you remember this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just remember that
was when I discovered </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you could watch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that the one where it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the best of both worlds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think so. I don't know
what it was, but I remember, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the one she
was on tour or some shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, there was like
a dance to it as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause I remember, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember that someone kept walking up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and getting up in front of the camera </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> for the movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh it's one of those, right right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So here's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is like the more you get older, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the more you have money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that your, your tolerance for the quality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So when you first, when you're like 12, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you will watch anything for some reason. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, people standing
up in front of the camera, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shaky cam quality. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No problem. I'll watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> The moment you get it like a HD DVD rip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, I can't go back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, 480p. Unacceptable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why isn't this shaking? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why is there no artifacts? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why is no one standing up
in front of the camera? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's going on? You know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sorry I just remembered. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah to me it was always
like the ripped DVDs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that I, that sellers and
Thailand would just sell. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So we'd have like little
shops where you'd have like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just DVD cases. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - They still do that there though right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They still do that now right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> This episode of Trash Taste
is sponsored by LiquidIV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] When you push your body hard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or just feel run down, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's extremely important to stay hydrated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Making hydration a priority
helps us feel healthier </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on a day-to-day basis. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And luckily with just
one stick of LiquidIV </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and 16 ounces of water,
you get two to three times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the amount of hydration
as plain water got. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] I love hydration.
- What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know sometimes, I
get a little hung over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And when I say sometimes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And what helps me get through
the hangover is LiquidIV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Unironically, I literally
drank it this weekend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was hung over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - My personal favorite flavor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is actually the lemon lime flavor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? Mine's actually
the passion fruit flavor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Damn, good choice Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Did you also know that LiquidIV </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> Back to the video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean that's pretty from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the internet speeds
there in Thailand, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Are they fast in Thailand? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Does everyone have access
to internet in Thailand? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, internet speed
in Thailand are like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> faster than some of them,
some of what I get in the UK, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at least for uploads. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean like upload speeds in the UK sucks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and most people won't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For some reason we,
we've been really cucked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the internet speeds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean download, completely fine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like upload you get
like 20 max, isn't it like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't talk to me until
you went to Australia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 20 was like fucking luxury in Australia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just, it's just
weird seeing that like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was paying you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> $70 a month in London, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but promised a hundred megabytes
down and six megabytes up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I never got more than three up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I never got more than 60 down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, I paid 60 bucks
a month for 0.3 up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But you live in a prison. So that's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - We still have copper
wire. It's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In like 2020, we have copper wire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I, I, no joke because when, when, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever I like lived in the
UK, I would be, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember being a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being a YouTuber you'd
have to pay for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the most expensive internet
available. So I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who's, who's the most
fastest internet provider? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And at a time it was Virgin Media. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. And the best that they
could provide is like 20 up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And when they say 20 up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really like 10 up in
like the quieter times in the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quieter times in the day.
And then I, I would like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's like fucking $200. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I remember
living in the UK before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like before, like I had
more American friends, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd see like screenshots of
people on Twitter being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a hundred up, a hundred
down. And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is obviously Photoshopped. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no way. There's no way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is a fucking lie
and I won't stand for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's no way people
get this upload speed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on any kind of internet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just tragic. In
like places like Europe, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can have, your
neighbor could have like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> one gigabyte upload and down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And just because the wire
stops at his house, you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you and you're his
neighbor, you won't have it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You have copper. I just,
I just couldn't imagine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> not living in Japan with
this God-tier internet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that never breaks.
Nothing ever bad happens. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You say God-tier internet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have shit internet compared to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro my internet is just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Jesus came down and
fucking blessed my router. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, what do you have? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - au. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - au? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What speeds are you getting? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - One gig down like 400 megabytes up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm getting 70 down,
70 up at most on wire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, for some reason, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my apartment's like
semi-new but even then they, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they apparently can only
do like copper, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or like some really outdated system. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I'm on WiFi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I get 500 up, 500 down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck am I on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know what they gave you Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I upload like nearly
like half a terabyte of files </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> every week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that would actually just be impossible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on my old internet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like right now it's like, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that that video I just
filmed was 150 gigabytes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh no worries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It'll take four hours to upload you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like whatever it's crazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like this podcast I upload every, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every day after we film it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like 300
gigabytes of video files. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And uploads overnight while
I'm sleeping and I wake up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> my PC is on. It's all done. It's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Meanwhile back in Australia
it's like, 800 meg file. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Give it eight hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. It'll be done by the morning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly it's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's fucking tragic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah. I mean, I
really appreciate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Back to the whole, watching
shitty quality stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I recently watched "Chernobyl"
and I wanted to watch it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, in high quality because I just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. You can buy it on YouTube. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's how I watched it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's how you watched it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I watched it on Amazon Prime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I had to pay every
episode individually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I had to do that as well actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But this is, this is how done I am </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> with not watching stuff
in like high quality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I would rather pay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was like $3 an
episode and it offered me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did you want to pay a $1.50
for standard definition </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> or for $4 for HD? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think you should be shot as a company, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whoever is in charge of the
decision deserves to be shot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right. Okay. I'm joking. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That's terrible. That is a joke by the way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - For legal reasons, it is a joke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is a joke, obviously.
I'm just exaggerating. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who, who on Earth is willing to spend like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> $1.50 for standard definition,
but not the extra dollar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It is so scummy of these companies to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Why would you downgrade the,
like, this is what I hate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> If you have a product and then
you downgrade it and sell it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> on purpose. Like, no. No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, what I, what I wonder is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they obviously know no one's going to buy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the standard definition
because if you're buying, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you're willing to
buy standard definition, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> then you're going to be the
type of person who's probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> going to find other ways to watch it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> rather than watch it
in standard definition. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just makes me
irrationally angry. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I was, I was very much happy to pay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the 15 bucks to watch this whole
series. It was really good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I just hate the fact that one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it made me pay for every
episode individually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I guess in some weird
way, give me a package deal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Give me something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's for the
people who are like, oh, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I watched two episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't want to watch them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There should be some kind
of package deal for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Seasonal TV show right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think, I remember I rented,
no idea why I did this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why I just can't be bothered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of doing the whole dance of
some, watch something online, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> spend two hours trying
to find a link that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that doesn't give you viruses. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want to deal with that
shit anymore. Like it's just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's too stressful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the, watching movies is
already hard enough as it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not, I'm not doing this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not doing this
dance anymore. I refuse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I watched "Borat" on YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You watched "Borat" on YouTube? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I rented "Borat" on YouTube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because for some reason I
wanted to watch it again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I wanted to, I didn't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think I've ever
rented a movie on YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't, it was awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because for some
reason when I rented it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was only in like 480p, on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is, is that because it's an older movie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No I'm pretty sure that
"Borat" is at least in like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking 720 or 1080. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd like to think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, I'm pretty sure it
wasn't in 480. I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "What is this? What is this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't remember looking at this shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you, did you rent
the standard version? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, there was only one
choice. It was like three bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah there's only one
choice, standard definition. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then also, I just
found it really interesting, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that YouTube actually tells you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how many views the movie has. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it had like 20. On YouTube. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It might not have
been legit in that case. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No it was definitely like legit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like it was legit and it was just weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> because I was like, "This is so strange". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I've, I've been well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been watching a lot of
films on YouTube here in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I find like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if there's a film that's
not on Netflix or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or Amazon here, it's
normally on Japanese YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why. It's like, I started, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I started watching "The
Wire" on YouTube because, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you paying for it
all? You paying for it all, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like one by one? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No I'm paying like season by season. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But like it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I tried to watch
"The Wire" in the UK </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it just was not available
on like any platform </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that I was subscribed to basically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if it's not on Netflix and
it's not an Amazon Prime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm probably not going to watch it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I feel like here in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube is like the golden child. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was so many films here on YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so many TV series that are blocked off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're in like, western countries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So yeah if you're in Japan, use YouTube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a lot on YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like I'm repaying
my debts as a teen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? Just
paying for all these movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Punished with the standard definition. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I sit there as I ordered my
300 yen "Borat", SD quality, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 480p thinking, old Connor would have, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> would have gone online and
found an HD version today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, here you go movie, billion
dollar movie companies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Here's three bucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But alas, I don't have two
hours to kill, to find it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to have to deal with this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just, I just don't care anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've just like, I, I, yeah, I dunno. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I, I value my time too much now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm so busy now that the
thought of spending 10 minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to try to find a link. If I
get to the five minute mark, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm about to give up. I'm like,
"No, I'm not watching it". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> You've lost. You've lost. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like 10 years ago it'd
be like, day seven. Still, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd be like, "Maybe it's my location". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Changes VPN to other countries to try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and get a different Google
search. You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I would do whatever it took. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I remember I tried to watch the, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the documentary about Pepe
and I just, it was fucking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I couldn't even find a place to buy it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it was
- Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking impossible to try to
find this movie to watch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Were you in the generation where you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where people are watching
things on Megaupload? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah.
- Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you remember, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do you remember the dance
you had to do with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 72 minutes time limits? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So for anyone to anyone too young to know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so for anyone to anyone too young to know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they used to be the site
called Megaupload, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Where people would upload, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> full TV series and full movies on it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Now, most movies they're on time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It's normally like at least
an hour and a half, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - A hundred minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a hundred, like a hundred minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So Megaupload for a free
account had a time limit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of 72 minutes. And for
every 72 minutes you watch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you had to wait 72 minutes to watch the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to watch it again. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Such a dick move yet,
amazing marketing choice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was such a dick move. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was it because it was the only site that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was available for people? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was one of the only
file sites that was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "Welcome everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Come on. Put anything you want on here." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. And I remember, I
remember back in the day when it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause this was when I
was still in university. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> So I think back, back when
Megaupload was popular, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think VPNs were as popular. Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because VPN would be like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the easy answer to this nowadays. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right. And I remember
feeling like I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so fucking five head where, where, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what I would do is our university
had like a private network </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that we would connect to, to upload </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like our files or upload our projects </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so what I would do is I
would watch the 72 minutes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then I would connect to the, to the, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to the university internet
and start uploading on there, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Was it like the edgy
room? Was it the edgy room? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Something like that. Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then that worked great
until I did something stupid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I started blabbing my mouth about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (hosts groaning) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> So unfortunately I
lived in a shared house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So this 72 minute, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the 72 minute limit became
like five minutes where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone in our house
started watching Megaupload </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you use like the same network </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and use the same, same IP address. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, rookie mistake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And yeah, that was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I realized it's just much better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to live by yourself and just
not have to deal with people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sharing your internet. Do
you remember having to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you remember trying to game online </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on university internet? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] It was terrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And how fucking awful that was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Terrible. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a memory I don't
want to think about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have like flashbacks of just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the ping going from 10 to like 500 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Who's uploading porn? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it wasn't even
that bad for me because like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because of Australian interest, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> our default ping was like 300. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it was more like going
from like 300 to like 900. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I remember when I
gamed with an Australian </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, I've got great ping". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, what is it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh 300". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, that's not, by no
measurement is that a good ping. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you have below 250, you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> damn, this guy's paying for
like the premium internet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I dunno. I, I feel that
a university internet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> was just the most
temperamental thing ever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it was really cool 'cause I remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that because a lot of them
use the eduroam network. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember one time I went to Germany </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I walked past the
university and I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, I connected to the internet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I connected to that
university's internet." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I, it shared the same
ID for like WiFi or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But if I walk past any university, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you get free WiFi when
you're a university student. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - If it was using the same
network, which most of them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were I think in Europe,
it's really cool. Fun fact. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (Garnt) Wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Life hack. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Life hack. Just, I
don't know, do something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Walk past the university. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just get free WiFi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just get free WiFi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Stop complaining. It's free. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually have a really awkward story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about when I set up
the WiFi here in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Go on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Story time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Obviously, obviously we, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we just moved to Japan and
one of the hardest things, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially when we moved here was fucking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> setting everything up initially. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Joey knows all too well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Joey knows all too well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Connor moved here like
two weeks before me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So Joey, Connor had the cheat sheet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of just having Joey set
up everything for him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted to get in first
with Joey. I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Joey, I need help. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Garnt's coming. I know you're
going to be sick of Garnt" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He went and perfectly planned
out where I'd be burnt out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right as Garnt was about to ask me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like I could
see when you asked Joey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like to help you set up,
I could see like the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just the hope just wash over
his face and be like, "Oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "this is the last time Connor.
This is the last time". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember when you were
talking about setting up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like your driver's license and like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could see Joey's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "No, don't ask me Connor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I'm not going to do it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not doing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, that I feel bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Luckily there was someone
else who I hadn't bothered yet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to help me with, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So yeah. So as I was
setting up the internet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as, as you know, I have like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> really, really slow internet
compared to you guys. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Peasant.
- Peasant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Peasant internet. I can't
remember who I'm with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not au, it's the other, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Softbank? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it doesn't really matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It doesn't matter but they have the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they have like English support, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is why I picked them. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I had to, I had to try
and sort this out by myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So when they said they
have English supports </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's the most. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's basically just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> here's a person who translates
using Google translate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Japanese companies that
are like English support or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for foreigners only, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> 95% of the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just someone who doesn't
really speak good English </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just a way for
them to hike up the price. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh yeah.
- [Garnt] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like if you go to the like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what is it like, GaijinPot,
is that what it's called? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like that, that real estate website, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you go and find the same
properties on a Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> website, they're much cheaper. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like 30% cheaper at least. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor exhales) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, it's being taken
advantage of because you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They do do that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just ask someone who's
Japanese to help you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll save a shit ton of money, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you might lose a friend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But you'll have at least saved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a few hundred bucks.
- Just make a Japanese friend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to eventually lose said Japanese friend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pay him the money that you saved. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, there should be a service </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for someone to help you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that would have, that
could save you a lot of money, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Someone start a service. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hire a Japanese who speaks English </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to come with you to stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's my first really, right there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like the reason I was able
to set up my phone was 'cause </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> luckily, my cousin was here
at the time and I asked, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I asked her to do it and she works for JAL </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so she can speak pretty fluent Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And she helped me set it
up. Perfect. No bumpy roads. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Setting up the internet
was a fucking nightmare. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have one on my phone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'll tell mine after yours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. Because like, firstly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you, firstly like you have to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> set up with the internet
provider and then also set it up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with something else as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't have to do that for mine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You didn't, you didn't have to do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I, I've like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get billed from two companies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I don't exactly understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bruh. Bruh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds like a scam. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no. It wasn't a scam. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I made sure I wasn't a scam because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - How would you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I, I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because his English support. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Google translator
surely wasn't a scam. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not a scam. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Microsoft tech support. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They were very nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They assured me that my Windows PC, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was an Indian guy on
the phone. They assured me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I pay through Google
Play cards. You know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's totally legit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - From what I understand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to set up with like the ISP, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the person who provides the ISP. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did not have to do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then the guy, I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I think au provides both services. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Whereas my, my company did not
provide both services at once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I think yours is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yahoo Mobile or something
right? Where it's like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yahoo Mobile. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's probably like a, it's probably like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a version of like Yahoo
or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I remember I had that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I had to do something similar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. 'Cause, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause the person that provides the line </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the person that like
installs the router, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and rents out the router
and stuff for you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like two separate companies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Rents out the router?
They're like fucking 40 bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I know. No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But the thing is you can rent one out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and have them set up for you
or you can set it up yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I chose, no, with
the internet option I had, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't even have that option </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because I would have loved
just to rent out a router </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and have the engineer set it up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> No, I wasted a day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to figure out how
to set up my fucking router </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and connect it to the
ISP engine in Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and Japanese menus and everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It was, it was fucking hell blah, blah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But before that, I had to even just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> set up the deal that I was getting. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I phoned up and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. Yeah, I'm living here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I choose, I choose the English option. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And even then it's, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's rough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a fucking rough kind of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like, it took me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think an hour of, an hour phone call </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to communicate 10 minutes worth of stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And just to make sure that
everything was correct. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I tell them all my details </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so we're going through it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they, they tell
me that, "We're sorry, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "this is the fastest internet
you can get at this house at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "this apartment". And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like your lowest option </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you have on your website. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause they have like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they have like different tiers, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They have, they have like the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> high paying option and they have like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking peasant option. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - As they always. As they always. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - As they always do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "We're sorry, you can only
get the peasant option". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was like asking why. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they were saying, they told me that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm sorry, your building
is not new enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "And yeah, it doesn't have the
newest internet installed". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. That's the problem
with Japanese internet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that like it, depending on the building </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and the wires built into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "We can't do it. Sorry." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. So, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I was like, there's
no way that this is true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I my, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my apartment's pretty
modern. It's like it's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's I think it was built, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's newer than mine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Much newer than mine.
- Yeah it's newer than yours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I heard about the
speeds you're getting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] No problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like doubt.
- [Connor] Fuck Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where is this phantom speed coming from? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I was like, doubt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm actually stealing the
next door building you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, so, so like, so like I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let me consider this deal right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I, so I hang up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I phone out the next day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I could talk to
someone different. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I can just make sure that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It wasn't just that person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wasn't just that person
that I was miscommunicating to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. So I phone up, I go through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the same fucking hour phone call </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that doing it again, explaining, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yes. I just want to make sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "that this is the best
option I can go for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "This is the best option and
there isn't a higher option." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And, and the second person that
I was talking to, she goes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hold on a second. Let me
just talk to my manager". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so she gets her manager
and her manager comes on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the same fucking guy
I talked to yesterday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Noooo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Yeah, can I just make sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "that this is the highest
option available?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he goes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "You're the guy that phoned
yesterday didn't you?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Aren't you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, this is, this is awkward. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Can I just double, double make sure?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, "Yeah. I
mean, I just made sure again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "it's the best option available and," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This motherfucker. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wonder, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I wonder if you tried a
different internet company. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanted to. and so I, I go, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I go through the ordeal again and I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, give them all my details again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And this time I actually have to send my, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> send my ID or scan my ID just
to make sure everything's all, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything's all kosher. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Shit you not, first bill I get. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. I open up, Grant Maneetapho. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I send them my ID </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> so that they can verify
my name and address. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And they. And they fucking
auto correct my name again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Grant Maneetapho </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no. His name on
the ID must've been wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A lot of fucking idiots in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think the visa people
just spelled it wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck the visa people.
Fuck the government. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck's a
Garnt? That's not a name. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So what, you just
bought the shitty internet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's shit? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm sorry. I bought the shitty internet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It turns out it was shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So yeah. I mean, I couldn't be bothered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to fucking go through another like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two hour phone call with another company </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I just settled for it. And, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, trust me, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if you were perfect in Japanese, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it probably would've taken
just as long like 'cause </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well actually when Joey
helped me try to get my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> internet and SIM card. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And originally I got
internet and a SIM card </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the same company. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Turned out the SIM card just
didn't work on my phone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And 'cause they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, we don't sell this
model of phone in Japan". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So in, in Europe, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know if it's the same as the US </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you can basically
buy SIM cards anywhere </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they'll work with every phone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like it doesn't matter what it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You just put it in. It works. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. But yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> apparently that's not the case in Japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because of course it isn't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I found out that Japan is
the only country on Earth </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that uses the very specific
type of like, bandwidth </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> or whatever it is that
the phone lines use. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So a lot of phones don't work in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because Japan was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "No, no, no, we're going to be different". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Of course you are Japan". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course you are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everything's gotta be different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's why like getting a phone here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is fucking hell. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's why like SIM
cards is so expensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think recently they
did something about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're gonna change it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because I think the government is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's getting out of hand,
like the prices of phone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> phone carriers here are ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I'm paying more for my phone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than I am my internet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Me too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm paying 90 bucks a
month for my fucking phone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that doesn't include, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that doesn't include the phone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's, I bought the phone myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I'm paying like 70 bucks a month </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I get like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 4 gigs of data.
- [Connor] It's insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's insane. It's like, what is this shit? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> This shit is stupid. This
is way too much for shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's okay. It's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I mean, it's good service, but, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's good but. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's shit. But it's shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that they're charging
me this much. I paid, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I paid $15 In the UK for what I was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 10 pounds, for what I was getting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I paid like 20
pounds a month in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's expensive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - For like unlimited data. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah it's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And when in the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they say unlimited data, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they actually mean unlimited data. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never been throttled
in my data in the UK at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The speeds are fantastic
here. Don't get me wrong, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt} Speeds are great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But not to the point where we're at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we're talking a hundred
dollars a month speed. Come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's more than my internet bill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You're having a bit of, come on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a bit of a joke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean it works really
well, but I just, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's why like a lot of people I know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't even bother getting SIM cards </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you have to sit there for like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> four hours talking to them, asking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> answering dumb questions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they're trying to
sell you a ton of stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, 'cause I think
Aki doesn't even use a, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, she still has an American thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It just pays for pocket WiFi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because she's just like she looked at like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all of her friends getting, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the SIM cards and whatnot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm not going through
that shit. Fuck that." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's hell, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I just don't want to
have to charge a fucking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> portable WiFi thing all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Having a Japanese number
does help sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and things like a lot of forms require you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to have Japanese numbers for some reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah she just uses
my number for that so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow isn't that convenient? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Where's my Japanese
fucking fluent boyfriend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> who translates and does
everything for me huh? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. No, if I were her, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would totally do the same
thing to be honest. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly like, the only reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanted a phone was because
I didn't want to carry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> an extra thing with my
phone just to get WiFi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Same, same, same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you're like not carrying like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a purse with you all the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just annoying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. Exactly. But yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know several people who
just have pocket WiFi here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just 'cause it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't want to go
through the trouble of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> switching their phones or, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well I mean Reina still has pocket WiFi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> She's been living here for
like however many years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's insane. Do we even have? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Pocket WiFI isn't popular
in like Europe I don't think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and in the US it's like not mainstream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd never really heard
of it until I moved here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It exists but like it's, it's not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not common. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nearly common as you see here, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because clearly they've made
a market where the phone, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the cell phone carriers
are so fucking awful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that there's a whole
industry about avoiding them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the price of these pocket WiFis </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are much cheaper than the cell phone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Much cheaper, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just stupid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I legitimately dread
whenever I have to sort out like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the smallest thing within
like my living situation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause like they, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how they all
somehow always turn like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a five to 15 minute meeting
to like a fucking hour long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> An hour long ordeal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm waiting for the day
where you know how sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> when you get on a website,
if you change your email, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they'll be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Please come in-person
to change your email". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And it will be like four
hours. And it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I could've just done this online. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. Fucking Japanese banks, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I, I'm about to go fucking mad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh God, he broke the table. He's so mad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have so much salt towards, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Foreigners complain
about Japan, volume 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, Japanese banks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you want to preface
before we get into this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And we do love living in
Japan, very kind country. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But we are British and we
complain about everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I complain about everything in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm an innocent bystander in this case. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh bullshit. Like you don't
complain about the banks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - We complain about everywhere we live. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And especially if something
like is inefficient to a Brit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, we, we will
happily wait in line. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But if, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if that meeting takes any
seconds longer than it needs to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we are, we are going to
complain the shit about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, so Japanese banks, we have to fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> since our visa only lasts six months, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have to re, we have to
go to the bank every time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to tell them not to
cancel our card. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the thing about Japanese banks is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can do fucking nothing
on the phone. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So just, just so they don't cancel a card. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Every time my visa runs out.
Every time we renew our visa, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have to go there in person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And not just any branch of our bank, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have to go to the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Branch that you
started the bank account. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We have to go to that specific branch, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which if you don't live
anywhere near the branch, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you open your bank account.
You're pretty much fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - They didn't give me a warning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> They didn't tell you why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you could be stranded </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the middle of fucking nowhere in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and not be able to get any money out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause they've, they've canceled your card </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and not told you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. And another thing is,
I needed to go there for like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I needed a bank statement. Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You think for a bank statement,
that's a pretty normal, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just go on the app, go online. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a pretty normal
document you can obtain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from a bank. Correct? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I go to the, I go to the bank </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I asked for a bank
statement and they have like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking 70 million different
kinds of bank statements. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How hard is it to? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Tommy, Tommy money go in, money go out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Print money go in, money go out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is the document where you can see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> money go in, money go out transactions? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You spend money here. I
just need that document. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Okay, maybe we can do that." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe.
- Maybe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's see. They go, they go, they go in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I gotta go talk to
the manager about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally. Literally they
go, they talk to the manager. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They give me like two forms
to fill out and go and go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "So are you okay getting
this in three weeks?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Um I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Is there any faster way
to get this document?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "No, if you, if you want this document </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "because you didn't sign up for it before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "you have to wait three weeks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "and we'll send it to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Now, do you want this document monthly? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Or do you want us to like, just hold it?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "No. From now on give me this monthly." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because there is no other
way to obtain a statement if, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unless you just go to
the bank and ask for it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to ask for this option when
you sign up for a bank account, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or when you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you realized that
you need a bank statement </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for whatever, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is the point of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the 900 printers that
they have back there? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, what are you
using these printers for? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Paper airplanes yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so I'm waiting for this
document for like, for like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I needed to file some stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I needed a bank statement. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It took five weeks for it to get sent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't realize when
they said three weeks, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they meant three, like three, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Three weeks minimum. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Three weeks minimum. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Basically Japanese banks.
I don't know if we've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just been really blessed with UK banks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Our banks are really good in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The apps work amazingly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The apps work amazingly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can just transfer money on an app. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's pretty, it's pretty secure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I can have my statements if I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have like three to four,
no fucking five years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worth of like bank
statements that I can have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Download them in PDF. Do
whatever I want with them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No Japan has those as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I use a bank currently
that has a great fucking app </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I can do transactions all on my phone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The problem is, they're
not the major banks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All of the major banks are like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "You have to go in, in person, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "bring your fucking stamp and
sign like 17 pieces of paper. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "And we'll send you
something in two years." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah because I've
wanted to transfer money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back to my UK account for like, since, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since I moved here. I just don't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just dreading the ordeal
I have to go through just to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just so I can move money
from one place to another. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a whole day event. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is. It fucking is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - When it should be five minutes long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like every time I go to the bank, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I lose at least an hour or two of my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's unfortunate that like things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that should take 10 minutes
or 15 minutes, tops, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are always like four hours in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's where the frustration
comes from where it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've put middlemen and checks in places </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> where there didn't need
to be any, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, why do you
have to ask your manager </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if this dude needs a bank statement? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everything and anything you do, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they will always ask
the manager. It's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do any of your employees </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> have the ability to do
anything on their own? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are your employees like trained at all? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just make a fucking decision for yourself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Jesus, what are you employed for? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I mean like, by the
time I got the statement, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> the statement was like already out of date </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was a month
old statement. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So I had, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had to, fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like fucking begged because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I was filling
out tax stuff and I was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was fucking begging my
accountant and be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> please let this be like, please,
please let this be usable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I don't want to
fucking do this again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want to go
through this ordeal again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want to wait five weeks again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think the most
frustrating part about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that when you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> please help me with this thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they make it seem like
you're the weird one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like wanting to like,
make stuff go quicker </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> or do things simpler. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> They're always like, "Why
would you want to do that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "This is the way we do it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. This is, this is
the, this is the way that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's a hundred percent success rate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> why else would you make it any other way? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I remember, cause I think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think Dogen did a video about
the Japanese banks as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He did and he mentioned something else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one time where he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes you just have
to tell them like, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like just tell them no,
that's not going to work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then maybe be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to do this or help me do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the manager might be like, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's sad. Isn't it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That sometimes you have
to put your foot down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get anything done here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just terrible. It's just so sad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's that you have to
like pull tooth and nail </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get the best service that they offer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. Which is why I hate, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes I feel bad when I ask </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Japanese people to help me
with it. 'Cause if I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "Can you ask them to do this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, "No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "They don't do that here." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, if you have a foreigner friend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they'll at least ask, they'll be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey, can we do this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But if I'm asking a
Japanese friend to help me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like who's a hundred percent
Japanese and you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fluent in English somewhat, I'll ask them, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, can you ask them this?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They'll just be, they won't even ask </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they'll be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "No, no, no, no. You can't ask them that". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean look, just ask, just ask. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like try, you know. I don't know like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's such a Japanese way
of thinking though. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because they don't want to,
like embarrass themselves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - They don't want to ask
questions that they feel, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> they already know the answers
to because they feel like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like humiliating at times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Whereas I think I always
have the mindset of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's no harm in asking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I, I never thought
I would go to a place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's like, it's like a 50/50 on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> whether you'd be able to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a fucking credit or debit card. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well I got rejected for all my cards </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> in the start. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had to apply two, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Two or three times until I
finally got a debit card. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really? Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it was like the worst one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, so yeah. So in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> When, whenever you sign
up to a bank account </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in most countries that I know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get a fucking debit card. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah you too. This is so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah yeah. So, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in most other countries
you get a debit card </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in which you can spend your money, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> which you put in your bank. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In Japan. they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "We do not do that here." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - We do not want you spending your money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - We'll give you a bank card. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, they will give you a cash card, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A cash card yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In which you can take
out money at the ATM </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and also charge you a fee for
taking money out of the ATM. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So when you go to the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when you go to the ATM and get money out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you better be taking a
large amount of money out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Otherwise you'd just be
like fucked for fees. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, by the way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't pay with anything
with the cash card. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This cash card can only be used
to take out cash from ATMs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You also can't take out any
money with your debit card. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Debit card can only be
used to pay with things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes. Of Which if you
apply for a debit card, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have the possibility
of being rejected. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I, like, why? Why? Why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like credit cards, maybe? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I understand credit cards
'cause it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're using their money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like for most countries I know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking America, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they give out credit cards
like they give out free candy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. Same in the UK, same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Same in the UK like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause they want you to get in debt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So they can make your life hell, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> take you for all the money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, "Do you
have a pulse? Brilliant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Here's a 2000 pound debit", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You joke but that's how it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is how it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All the credit card companies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> make all their money off the people who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are failing to pay back
their credit cards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that's where they
make all their money from. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah in Japan, it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, you want to pay for
stuff not using cash?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what, I don't
know about that one chief. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm paying for like my
rent or something or I pay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to pay in cash.
Why do you make me pay in cash? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is like $1000. Don't
make me carry $1000 around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - After paying the ATM fee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah so like, I tried
to buy a new camera </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and my card, my debit
card had a limit on it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How do I change the limit? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Gotta fucking call them up haven't I? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh for fuck's sake. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Of course you do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's not an app
or anything I gotta do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I gotta call them up, explain to them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Why would you want to
increase the limit?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> None of your fucking business
why I want to increase. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's my money. I want to
use it. What do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah it's, it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like now that I've
lived here for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one and a half years, I've realized that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it would be more convenient for me to use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my foreign card here
than it would have been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to like set everything up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause like the fees that they charge you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever you take money
out, it's exactly the same, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's about the same fees they use. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the only real difference I feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> is like the exchange rate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, that, that
obviously goes up and down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You get fucked by the exchange rates. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why I always, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why I wanted the
debit card. 'Cause I was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like losing a lot
of money 'cause I was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was having to use my, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my British card and I
was just losing money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on exchange rates and fees. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because the pound is so
strong compared to the yen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah like right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to use as much yen as possible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because the rest of my money is in pounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's really strong and
I don't want to use that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I want to get rid of the
weak money that I have like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> spend it all, spend it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like in, in that
case it would be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it's way more convenient to
use like a third party company, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like Revolut or like
TransferWise, like get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you can actually
get like a physical card </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> where you put money into this account. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well yeah I used to have one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I used to have a card but
when the UK left the EU, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I lost that card and then they
stopped banking within the UK </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I had the one good card that I had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was perfect for transferring </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> for using foreign exchange was
just useless after a while. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Big sad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well look at us talking
like adults about credit cards </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and banks and whatnot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well it's just sad because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> they've made a system that
makes it hell at every turn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and you need to answer for
every, like little things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you've just like, comfort </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or you have to explain why you want them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I shouldn't have to explain to you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why I want to up the limit
on my card. Like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that should be a me. Why do
I have to tell you? Like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well I'm getting interrogated </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because I want to buy a fucking
camera. Like, what is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't like this. I, I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not that I don't mind telling them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like it's for a camera. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But the fact that I have to
answer to you, like, like what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like if it's for like a
couch that you don't like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you'll say no, fuck you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's an ugly ass couch. Fuck that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yo send me the link.
Let me check this out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Yo really? The thread count
on those sheets suck bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not upping the card. What? What the? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why are you asking me this? Is there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is there a situation where you like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna launder my money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Well then of course
you're going to say no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm fucking doing
something illegal. When, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why is this ever going to work? Like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what is this point of this question? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't ask me this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're making conversation.
If so fucking stop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We want like UK banks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just got a text the
other day being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "We've upped the limit
on your credit card." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, I didn't ask, but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cheers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cheers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But UK banks are always really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> They update me all the time
you know. The app is fantastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can transfer money to anyone.
No questions asked you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I mean like
fucking bank apps are like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think only, maybe like
a thing that was invented </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two or three years ago here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> When I first moved here like
none of the banks had an app. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Did you have online
banking when you moved here? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Literally I and I still don't
have it here because it's a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know how to transfer
money online in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I still haven't figured
it out. I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well I mean, some banks
don't even let you do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even know if it's possible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> All I know is that
somehow when I buy things, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you been able to log
in into your online banking? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've logged in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So the online banking that
I have to send money is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I, okay. I have logged into my bank, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but if I want to send money, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's through like a different,
it's through my card. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's really weird. Again, this whole shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's been separated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't understand what's going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't make any sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese banks suck, please, please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is why, if you're a
tourist, you got it lucky man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't have to deal with this stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is why everyone says Japan
is the best place to visit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> worst place to, not
worst place to live but. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it's, it's, it's
an amazing place to live. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's an amazing place to live. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's just a lot of things
that I took for granted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I thought were just
little conveniences or just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just the way the world works </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in first world countries I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You get mega angry
and then you go outside, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you go to Matsuya and you get
your matsuya and you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Nice. All right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Lots of little distractions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's all worth it but for that one day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you're dealing with this stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm finna book a flight home. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm getting real tired of this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually no, 'cause it's not just Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause, 'cause I've lived
in Thailand as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And even they've got their
banking system more convenient </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> than they do. And I've
got, I got, I have an app. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all I can transfer my
money in my Thai bank account </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to my Japanese bank
account if I wanted to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't do that in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And Japan is a first world country. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thailand is like a second world country. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - When I left the UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> closing everything and
getting everything all sorted, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> moving, everything I needed to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I did everything in like half a day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Just making phone calls, just being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey, can I do this? I'm, I'm leaving." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like, "Oh yeah,
totally fine okay." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Can I do blah blah blah? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, it's all good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Or every phone call lasted
like at most, the whole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the being on hold took
longer than the phone call. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like, it's so easy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it's, it's so frustrating. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whereas here it's
like, oh you're moving? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh you're moving? That's
a whole month process. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> That's not because you got to
unpack and move stuff around, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's because you got to go to the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You gotta call up and go to
fucking in store everywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So absurd. So again, we complain a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about these aspects of Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we are very grateful to Japan
for allowing us to be here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, there's a reason
why you don't just leave. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah we love it. You know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're probably going to stay here for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm going to be living
in Japan for a long time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I just, you know, I think
that when you live in a place, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you have the right to
complain about certain things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I complain about everywhere equally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You everywhere socks, everywhere sucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. There's no utopian country. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want people to get the idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that we're not fucking grateful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or we're not like happy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because sometimes we get
comments like that sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We do get comments like that sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we are very happy here in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're just being real
with you guys that's all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We just, we just like to complain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about the little things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You guys like it when
we're annoyed about shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why we're annoyed about shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you guys are going
to move to Japan. I, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I want to be honest with you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and tell you what's going to be fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and what's gonna suck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's going to be, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's going to be lots of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking great things about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but just be prepared for
those little conveniences. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whenever you have to do
anything to do with like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese bureaucracy or just setting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> setting up your living situation. I, I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You will be writing your name, address, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and phone number more times
than you'll ever think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You will lose at least a
week just trying to figure out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I think that's
the thing that annoys me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In the UK when I had to deal
with this stuff, it was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was maybe an hour
out of my day at most. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'd get on with my day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> If it happens here, it
derails your whole week, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it takes a completely, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you have to reschedule everything, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cancel everything you're doing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> because you've got a call from the bank </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they said that your card is canceled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they didn't tell you
until now it's canceled. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just remembered, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if you guys have in the UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like in Japanese
and Australian airports, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like sometimes
that service where like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know how on your suitcase, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you can put like a belt around
it so it doesn't burst open. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Some people forget that or,
you know, don't buy that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never had to use that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So instead you can, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you can use a service that
you can like wrap up your bag </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in like plastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] I see that in the UK. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - In Australia it's like
10 seconds you just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wrap this up. Here's the money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> They do it. All right. See you later. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did it in Haneda once in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, can you fill out this form? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Write your name, address
and phone number." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, I'm never
going to see you again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Just wrap up my goddamn bag. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Get the fucking cling
film out, wrap it around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'll give you 20 bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like deadass, I looked
at this woman. I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> what do you need this for? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, why do you need to know my name, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> phone number and address? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh you know, like just in case." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, because you're
wrapping my bag in plastic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm a customer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I will do it myself.
Give me the cling film. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah give me the cling wrap. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll fucking do it myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I will pay you to not fill in that form. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was ridiculous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's frustrating, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I just wasted, like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two minutes of my life filling
out this form, that for one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't even know what
they're going to use it for, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but second of all, completely unnecessary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just frustrating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> giving out your whole
fucking information to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to shit that you feel like it
just totally doesn't need it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I just don't want to deal with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I hate doing that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's also like, you
know, I feel as well like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's so many situations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you're canceling
something or, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're upgrading something. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, can you write your
phone number and address?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty sure all my
information is on system. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Just look it up. I'll
give you my fucking name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just look it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If it changes, I'll let you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll keep you updated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like how often do you think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm changing my name and address? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like one, one thing I'm
fucking dreading when we move, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because we're all planning to
move from where we are now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, you're already
in process of moving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is just the process of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> changing my address in
every bill that I've had. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just, I wake up
in a cold sweat at night </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I gotta do that. I gotta do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have been suffering
for the past month on that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and it shouldn't be a suffering thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It just sucks because I feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your life just comes to a
halt for a month because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they've designed systems that make it so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. And it's got nothing
to do with like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people who don't understand the language, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> having a hard time, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Even if you're fully Japanese, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's still hard as shit to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it shouldn't be that hard to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like you get pretty good
customer service in most aspects </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> of, of Japanese life I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But for some reason with
personal information companies, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like it comes to
a halt and it doesn't, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it doesn't improve at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> The customer service
isn't any better for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that's why I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan has one of the lowest
productivities out of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of first world countries. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not surprised. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because they work the most. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We would have flying cars by now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They work more hours
than any other country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and have less to show for
it. You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you know, I think
in some European countries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they're considering a
four day workweek even, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you know I was just like, fantastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You bring that up to
government officials in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "How does, how does that country run?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> "How is that not a third world country?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "How's their economy not
crumbling to the ground?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Again. It's just
like, how do you fix it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When everything in society has
been made to be long-winded, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> bloated and slow? Like, what do you do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like how do you fix that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause it's like a whole
cultural thing at that point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well this is a country where, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of schools are
still six days a week. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's ridiculous. Let alone
four day workweek what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it took like a fucking
global pandemic, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> For the country to
embrace working from home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and online meetings. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They were throwing out
like the buzzword of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> home workstation or whatever
the fuck it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a new thing that was
just invented. It's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we've come up with this
revolutionary thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Get this, you can work from home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And Japanese people
are like, "Impossible." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That that is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Telework. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Telework that's it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Telework. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They call it telework. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think also, I think they're now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slowly starting to phase
out the hanko because of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> They're finally putting in like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the government they're
bringing it up. And trying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have we ever explained
hankos? I don't think we have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hanko are basically, is
like the, it's like a stamp </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> essentially that has your
surname on it or, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> company name or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Basically it's the Japanese
equivalent of a signature. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But incredibly tedious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's incredibly tedious because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that means you have to
carry your hanko everywhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whenever you're like, if you forget. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've had moments where I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have everything except the hanko </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they just don't accept it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, this is a
stamp I bought at Don Quijote. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for like 200 yen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Don Quijote is like the dollar shop here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You can, you can just
get it at a dollar shop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Imagine your name is Connor, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then, you know, you can, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you can go those gift shops </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they have like the license plates, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like Connor. It's like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like imagine you just go to the store, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you find your name on the license plate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you bring it and go look, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's my name. It's my
name, take a picture. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The thing is, is like, I, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I wrote up a thing as to why
Japan still uses the hanko </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and not signatures and
the most accepted like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> excuse, I guess, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just going to call
it an excuse as they, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as why they don't use
signatures, they were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "Well, anyone can copy a signature." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Anyone can go to Don
Quijote and buy a $2 stamp. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> What are you on? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. It's so dumb. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. I mean, if you have a popular name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What happens if you have
a popular name, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is it? What is it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> What's the one that you see,
Tanaka? Is that the one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah Tanaka or like
Sato or like any of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the common ones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everyone probably, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> every Sato probably has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the same fucking Don Quijote stamp. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, this is bullshit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like signature is way harder
to copy than buying a stamp. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you hear about the
fucking Josh battle royale </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that happened recently? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Did you hear about this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So like, I think like a year ago, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> some guy in like some state or something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he looked up every, he was, his name was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Josh Swain. Josh Swain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Josh Wayne? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Josh Swain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Josh Swain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> He looked up like every Josh on Facebook </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in his area and added
them to a group right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he just sends a message, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "Guys. You know why we're here." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're going to battle
for name Josh Swain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] There are already Joshes here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We are going to have a
battle royale and whoever, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> whoever emerges victorious
can keep the name Josh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So that's how it works with hankos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's literally a movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like they have to
do that with hankos right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a fucking battle royale movie in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's that exact same concept. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah yeah. It's called, it's called </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Riaru Onigokko", "Real Tag" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where basically it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like a survival horror movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's actually a really
good movie and book, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but basically in the it's
set in like the future </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where the king of Japan, his name is Sato, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is the most common surname in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "I want to be the only Sato." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So what he does is
every night at midnight, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> he's like all of the Satos in the country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to come out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He picks legend game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Literally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, and they're like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "To all Satos of Japan.
There are too many of you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "So we're going to get
rid of some of you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like literally
a survival horror movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where all the Satos are
like running for their life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> not to get fucking eliminated. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That sounds epic. I want to watch this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a great fucking movie. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It sounds like an anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it really does. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> No, it's a great movie, but
it's literally like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just trying to think.
Is there anything in like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> UK or Australia that is like
unnecessarily like slow? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like we just kind of get rid of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Internet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, we've already
complained about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like as in like
the systems that we have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't really think there's
anything that's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything's been like easy to do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I didn't really have
experience living on my own </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> in Australia. So I can't
really say much about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean in the UK everything
that could be done online </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is done online. You know, I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I cannot even, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even think I ever
went anywhere in person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for anything like government. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it could all be done
by phone or by online. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Water bill, internet, phone, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> government documents like local tax. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like all of it was done online. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think the only thing
really is like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to get like a driver's license fixed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you probably have
to go in person for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Even then in the UK you can, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can get it mailed to you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - When I renewed my driver's license, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I literally just sent, sent
them the license in the mail, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> uploaded a scan of my picture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they just renewed it for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. You can't do that in Australia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We've really been like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the UK has gotten really
good at making things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's efficient. I guess I
just took that for granted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You sure did Garnt. You sure did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're like, "Everywhere's like this". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I'm, I'm like, I thank God </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that we're signed with GeeXPlus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they handle our tax. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God. I can only imagine doing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I've heard horror stories. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I did my tax
before joining GeeXPlus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was the fucking worst. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you are a freelancer in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> good luck doing tax. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've heard. I've heard that
freelance tax forms in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are the worst thing,
- It is godawful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Doing tax in the UK is bad enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, if, if that was bad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> how was it in fucking Japan? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - God awful. I hate it. I regret it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought it was bad in the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but not now I look back at
how doing taxes in the UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like everything can be
done online. From home. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah everything can
be done online at home. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's pretty good. There's
an app you know, like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - In Japan you have to take a
fucking bag full of receipts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to like the town ward and like scan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, go through all of them
and like fill it in yourself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh my. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is the worst. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why there's no freelancers in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fuck that. I don't want
to deal with that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'll join a company." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's so sad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the worst. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I will say though,
that it was pretty cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the first time I discovered
the hanko and it, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's cool for 10 seconds
until it becomes a burden. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's, it's cool for like the first week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're living here in
here when you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Ooh, I'm stamping my" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "I'm part of Japan now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm part of the culture here guys". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Let me, let me put my signature per." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Look at my clan. It's
the Maneetapho clan." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that's what it feels like. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When you're fucking stamping
your second name down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bro this is like a
really like traditional, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like kind of swirly like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> feudal Japan style stamp. It looks dope. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It looks dope. I could, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I could see why they haven't
like gotten rid of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it feels like I feel cultured </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> as I'm stamping my fucking name down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know, you know when you see like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> an old, in old films where you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're writing a letter
and they fucking stamp down </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the wax.
- The wax. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what it feels like every time I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> every time I stamp down my hanko. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But then it gets to a point where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you live here for a year </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Fuck's sake. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "Can we not just go back to signatures?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just give me a pen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, you stamp it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "No, it's not good enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You haven't stamped it good enough." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, what do you
mean? I can read it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, it's slightly crooked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Can you fill it in again, please? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If it's slightly crooked, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and if there's slightly
not enough ink on it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they just won't accept it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah well so I remember, I filled out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like this three page document </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I made one mistake and
I did the line through it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And the guy at the driving
lesson place is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You gotta redo it all." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You made a mistake.
You got to redo it all." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like you can't
cross things out here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, I crossed it
out right there. It's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A hundred percent
accuracy only in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, what do you, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can clearly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There is no any percentage in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> only a hundred percent wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like you can clearly make out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that there is absolutely no problem here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know that I don't mean
the thing that I crossed out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you know the thing,
what I meant to put. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why are you going to make me fill out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this three page document again?
Because I made one mistake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything is a fucking like trapeze act </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where if you fuck up, you've
got to redo your whole life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Born. Do life again. Reset life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah only perfection here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm surprised that they you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you fill out a
document wrong they're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "Nope, no license for
you. Come back next day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Gotta redo it again." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically, if you want to live in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I hope you like filling
out forms because you are, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Correctly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Correctly because you are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No mistakes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Expect perfection in every way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Moving here is kind of like
Form Simulator 2021 honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So Papers, Please but every day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's exhausting, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. That's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's kind of why like I'm dreading </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these next few months when we
move studios and move houses. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm going to be in a
foul mood in like October </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> when I have to move, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just gonna not want to talk to anyone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like fuck you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah if we're complaining now about this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when we actually start moving, my God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> our podcast show will be
so much more depressing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I know I'm going
to lose at least a week </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just from this alone. So, sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sorry if you don't get any
videos for like that month. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - My fucking video schedules is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the slowest it's ever been. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because of this shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because of this shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's, it's, it shouldn't
shouldn't be like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How do, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how do normal people
who work nine to five? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, sorry. I mean, sorry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Nine to 12 in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How do they have time to do this stuff? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't understand because
people don't stop working here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and stuff closes on weekends here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So what do they do? I don't understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They take paid leave. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Meilyne] They take a week off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They take a week off, are you serious? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - They take a week off to move.
Don't they only have by law </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a week of paid holiday anyway? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] No, no, no.
They get like 20 days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 20 whole days in a year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you lose what, like five. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You lose a quarter of your paid holiday </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you want to move here in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Japan, the country
where moving is a luxury, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you want to do anything in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you got to take a day off
to call them up and do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, you know you can't, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you want to change your phone provider. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You've got to take a day
off work. How weird is that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck? It's weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - The fact that you can't just do it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like during a lunch break is ridiculous. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's tragic. It's tragic.
It really is tragic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So as someone who
has moved before, Joey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what is the moving experience
like here in Japan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> In one word. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause you already moved
once here in Japan right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've moved twice now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, you've moved twice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah so the place I'm about to move to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> will be my fourth place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh shit. Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You moved twice, but
you've had four places? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - How does that work? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I mean, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I moved in here and then I
moved two separate times. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh okay.
- Oh okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sorry sorry. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was like, wait those
numbers don't add up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Two plus two equals four. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, the first time I moved, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I moved from Australia to Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it was a lot easier for
me because I had help. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I had help from my, like my auntie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So she did all the paperwork for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I didn't know fucking how to do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But then she was like, all right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well now you know how to do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, What? Do I? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do I? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like when someone
builds a PC for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like great. You can do it on your own now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like you've passed the tutorial stage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I hope you were paying attention. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, thanks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Expert mode begin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not even like a, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Would you like to listen
to that again?" option. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just like, I hope you were listening. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. So the first time
when I moved here was fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then from the second time on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I moved to my own place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, it was hell and
it's and it's still hell, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> This is the third time I'm doing it now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's not easier at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like the only thing
that makes it easier now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that you know exactly the
list of things you need to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the list of don't, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but the process of
going through that list. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The time is not any more efficient. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The time is not any more efficient. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It is just as time consuming
and fucking ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's why no one moves right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No one wants to improve that
life because they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, I do want to improve my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's what I'm saying right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, I've got
asbestos. I've got mold, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but you know, frankly,
putting up that paperwork, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well that's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not an understatement to say that or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> not an overreaction to say that
moving in Japan is a luxury </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and it shouldn't be a luxury.
It's fucking ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's, that's why they're
able to charge the same amount </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> when you have to renew
your contract right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is why I don't know
where you're explaining this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but the reason we're all moving is because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when your contract ends for
like your rental period, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> normally you'd think it
can just easily roll over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and stuff like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's how it does in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's how it does in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's that's how it
did in Thailand for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Most countries yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's how I did in most countries. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Nope. You've got to go
through the same process again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and pay the same fees. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you gotta pay two
months of rent for free. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> For no reason. Just, because they want it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, No fuck you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not giving you two
months of money for free. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> For what? For this shitty
apartment? Fuck off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I hate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you use like a moving company </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first time you moved? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I got a moving
company, but I mean the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the moving company we're using for now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the new place is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has like a service where like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll come in and like pack it for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like wheeling off the moving company </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is probably the easiest thing
to sort out when moving. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's everything else that's
a pain. Like the inter, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the internet is the fucking worst. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh I can imagine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like setting up internet
for a new place is, ugh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's hard in the UK as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like the hardest one
because they're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh yeah. So are you okay with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "going four months without
internet in your new place?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No. No I'm fucking not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah but at least like
with our current place, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like they'll give us like a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like a kind of portable or not portable, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like a rental WiFi kind of thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you're not like
completely out of internet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Still sucks though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah it still sucks that
I have to wait for like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the full price to like kick in. But yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> The moving company is
weirdly the smoothest thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Awesome. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember in the UK, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> when I moved all my stuff
to my parents' house, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I, again, I was trying to
do it as cheap as possible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And there was like a
service that had like vans, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but for Uber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's called like AnyVan
or something in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Pay the guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Guess how much it cost to go basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from London to North Wales, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like that's like basically half the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How much do you think that costs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to hire that van? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, like one van? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just one guy in a van just driving. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Normally I'd think maybe like, I dunno, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 300 pounds maybe? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was 120 pounds. I think I paid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That sounds sus as fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I was so fucking
scared the whole time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when this put my, because
this guy was just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> "All right, what are we doing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Where are we putting the boxes?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What are we doing, it
was just like some guy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, again, again, like
Uber for vans just chilling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He was really nice. And my mom was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, he was really nice." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when he got there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, sick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was so cheap. And I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this guy can't be getting
much so I gave him a fat tip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause apparently he was really nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and was really helpful to my mom. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds scary though. Isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That just calls for some dude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who has all your stuff
in his van and then just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> drives off into the middle of nowhere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was just, there was
a GPS tracker on his car. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But again, he could just take, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh you went with him? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's even more scary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just give them all my,
all my valuable stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like see you later. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So your laptop, your PC, everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah everything, everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Geez. That's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's scary. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And somehow we fit it
all in a van and everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and yeah, somehow it was fine.
The service was great, paid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It was pretty much cheap as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah Jesus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm thinking I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fuel must've been
like half of that cost. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like this man cannot be
getting any money from this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why I was like, fat tip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He might be living
just strictly off tips. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I don't know.
Fuck, I feel bad. But. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I don't know 'cause
like tipping culture, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Tipping culture is different
everywhere in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And in the UK, it's you guys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are kind of in the middle I
guess, of tipping culture. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Japan is nonexistent,
which, you know, there are, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there are times when I wish </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that I could tip people in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I get some of the
best customer service here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've ever had worldwide. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I can't tip people here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's because it's the whole
philosophy of, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the best customer service is expected. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait what was the
tangent that we were on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before I started talking about my van? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - We were talking about
your moving company right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Moving company. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I basically just said
the moving company was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Doing it. Oh yeah. Sure easy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because when I moved in the UK </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> from London back to Brighton
like just use Gumtree </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I, I feel like with the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I, I don't know anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who's actually moved,
used the moving company. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone's just knowing a mate, whoever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone has mates to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At least one friend
has like a giant van. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean that's because putting our age. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But I think when the people
who use moving companies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are like families. Just
absurd amounts of stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That makes sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - At my age, I, I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I moved out I recycled or threw away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> probably about 70% of my belongings. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I'm like, I
don't need this anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, 'cause I was like,
oh, well, you know, I like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I put everything on for free on Gumtree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All my stuff was like, come get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who wants my wardrobe? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Who wants my fucking? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well I did with like,
without car movers as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like a Japanese
site that we can just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> throw like couches and beds for free. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And people just come pick it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - People will go on like Craigslist, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like fucking give things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because like throwing out
trash here costs fucking money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like an absurd amount
of money to throw out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Where I'm just like, why
would anyone do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just give it to someone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - True, true. Shit, I
just remembered banks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Sorry. Sorry to shit on banks again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can't, I remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was in, I was out in Shibuya </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was out till like 2:00 AM </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, all right,
well I want to go home now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'll go get a taxi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, great,
well, I've got no money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm just gonna quickly go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and get some money from the ATM. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It turns out that after working hours, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you just can't withdraw
money. So you know, fuck me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was stranded in the middle of nowhere. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't get money. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have to wait until what 8:00
AM until the banks open up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> For some reasons the ATMs
stop fucking working. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never, I don't
think I've ever had to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think I've ever had
to take money out like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, sometimes I have a good night. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, I spend more than I intended to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got no more cash left. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No biggie. I'll get some
from the ATM. No. Fuck me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck me. And even if it
is during working hours, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I got to pay anyway, what am I paying for? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's an ATM. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's no one there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no one in the machine
giving you money is there? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is there just a small man
sleeping in the machine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who's awake during these
hours? Why is it this much? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Like, like there are
some ATMs like to, to explain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There are some ATMs in
the UK that do charge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to take money out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But they are like, they're like the like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no branded ATMs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sketch as fuck ones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At some, at some
sketchy like corner shops, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Those are the ones where like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's probably a man inside.
Just taking your money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Those are the ones where it's fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 2:00 AM or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just need some fucking money out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to go to the club or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And you're like, sure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll pay five pounds to take out my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 20 pound entry fee to this club, whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm drunk enough to do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Now, imagine now, imagine that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But for every transaction you do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's, that's taking
out money here in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You have to take out a lot of money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. They charge like five
bucks each time or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah they charge like five bucks every, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want to access my fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Unless you go to that
bank's branded ATM. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But even then sometimes
though, they charge you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Because yeah,
because you have a limit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as to how many times you can
take money out per month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But that depends. If, if you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for some reason you're a rich motherfucker </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you have X amount of
money in your bank, it's free. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like, no, no, no. it's on us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You have a lot of money with us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We ain't going to charge you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Punish the poor. Feed the rich. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why? Why are you taxing
the fucking poor people? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck? That's
just like what's wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like everything in this system </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is designed to make you hate them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Damn you capitalism. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I, what I was, when I, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I wanted to get the
taxi home, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm so goddamn lucky that
I have a foreign card </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I just carry on me at emergencies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I'm like, you never know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. For my, my
foreign, my British card </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is just like my getaway,
get out of jail free card. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like 100% more reliable </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> than using the card in the
country it was made from, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like how does that work? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My British bank card
works at every single ATM, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any time of the day, whenever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> They don't charge me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They just charge me the exchange
rate cost, which I accept, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, cause I'm changing the money. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Whatever. They got to do
that. But you know, I don't, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I genuinely don't know how I
would've got home that night </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I, if I didn't have my British card. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What do Japanese people do in this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do they just go to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking manga cafes don't they? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, no, because then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you'd have to pay for the manga cafe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh shit yeah. That's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - They literally sleep
outside the station. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Homeless Simulator for like six hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, you've probably seen it before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> They just literally sleep
outside of the station. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh is that like the
Shibuya Meltdown shit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shibuya Meltdown is something else. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like sometimes I've seen, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> walking past the station or whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like couples and
like, you know, businessmen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just sleeping outside
of the station, waking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> waiting for it to wake up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like it's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Absolute insanity that
this is what it has come to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like talking about this
now. I'm like, I I'm, I'm, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm really starting to
sweat this year right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Because, because of the world's situation, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> haven't been able to track
to travel back to the UK. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I look at the expiry day
on my card and it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like creeping up. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it was, it was like,
'cause before I moved up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like the "Death Note" counter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - They send you an automatic one though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> At least my bank does. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah it sends me to my UK address, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> which no one is living in right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause my parents are in fucking Thailand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm here in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> So my, my I'm not going to
say what the exact date, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - My exact address. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is, it is in 2021, my
expiry date for my British card. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait when does mine expire? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm, I'm starting to
sweat 'cause I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Shit man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> If I can't travel back to
the UK to get my new cards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then I'm kind of just like
resting on my Japanese cards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to work now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mine's 2023. We good. We
gucci. We gucci. Fuck you Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It's scary. Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean that was a,
that was a nice little rant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thanks a hell here.
Sorry. I'm sure most people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> have absolutely no care in the world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about Japanese banks, but now you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot more about them
about how shit they are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well there's probably a lot of audiences </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of Trash Taste who are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> one day I want to live in
Japan and live that weeb dream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Just be prepared. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think we've done a good
job at least, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> bigging up the stuff
that is worth, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> giving praise to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And we're brutally honest
about the shit parts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, like all things
considered Japan is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if it's the best, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's definitely like either
comparing the UK to Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's been a fucking amazing place to live. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't know if
I'd put it as the best, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's definitely, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well the pluses definitely
outweigh the minuses. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I enjoy living here
more than the UK. More so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean I'm definitely have enjoyed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> my previous year and a half
more than I have in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We'll see how I am five years
down the line, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But right now I can, I'm definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm approaching my fifth year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm definitely gonna
be here for at least </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> two, three more years I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Definitely. Definitely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I fucking love it
here. It's so much fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's an amazing country. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So expect Trash Taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for at least another two or three years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just don't, just don't
tell me I have to move house </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> or fucking change my internet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or change my phone because I
am going to get a headache. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just tell me ahead of
time when that happens </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I'll just fucking wooo, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get out of there before I'm
like trying to like this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> this rant is me like mentally
preparing for like the, the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the month in like the month
and this year that I'm going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to dedicate to moving. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I mean paying taxes
was way more, like much, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> much more enjoyable than, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> than doing any of the
forms I had to do in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's weird. But anyway, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you know who doesn't
charge us to use ATMs, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> our wonderful patreons. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God, look at them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But look at this guy here on screen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - They live rent free in our heads. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would've charged them to
get their money outta here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I bet they have a good banking system. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why they're supporting us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Touche. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I bet this guy could
get his bank statement online. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I bet they can play or pay
all their bills online right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course they can. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Hey, if you'd like to
support the show man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what they're doing right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, make sure to go to

<SPEAKER_01> where I don't have to pay
my bills by carrier pigeon. </SPEAKER_01>
