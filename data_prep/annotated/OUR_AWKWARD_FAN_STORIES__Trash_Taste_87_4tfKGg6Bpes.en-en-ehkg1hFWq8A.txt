<SPEAKER_00> - It's time for dinner! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Back in my day, people
talked face to face! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ass to ass! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ass to ass! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (soft music) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, Joey, do the intro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, hello, my
bass boosted brethren. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Welcome to another episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, that was-
- That one sounded so sad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck?
- That was an old school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Joey intro.
- I know! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm bringing back the alliteration. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] For one episode! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even though that was
not alliterated at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You sounded so depressed, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You sounded so depressed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, Mudan let's do this again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mudan, base boost me when I say this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Welcome back my bass
boosted brethren brothers! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Welcome back to another
episode of Trash Taste podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm bass boosted boy number one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with bass boosted boy
number two and three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hello.
- Hi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My permanent life is bass boost. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's what I was going to say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's just your voice, isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It never got turned off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It just got left on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Put up the treble on
Connor, like, really high. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> How you boys been? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're good.
- We're all tired as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my...
- What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - "How are you doing?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What, am I not allowed
to ask how your day's been? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just kinda wish you'd asked me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with a little more enthusiasm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - How you guys doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How was your weekend?
- How have you been Connor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How have you been? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - How have you been? I'll be
a therapist for this week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thank you, Joey. I appreciate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] How are you feeling? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like you need a therapist, Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I feel like you've
almost been canceled again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on Twitter for saying more hot takes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is this gonna be the weekly thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or it's just like review
possible cancellations? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Cancellation of the week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cancellation of the week! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And today, on the chopping block today! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just found it funny
that after all this time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you actually go out your
way to watch Anime again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The one time I tweet about Anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I almost get canceled. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey has the first Anime
take in what, like, six months? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What was the take? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The take- (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Remind me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So let me bring you up to speed, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Because this is a multi-layered thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is like a multi-layered meme. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Multiple angles to cancel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so it started off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the layer first starts at
the Kson episode, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Which pictures of us recording,
it just went up, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Thankfully, a lot of people loved it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a great episode, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But on one segment of that show, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there's a highlight clip of it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is where we talk about the
"Jujutsu Kaisen" Anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's because
we were talking to Kson </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about what Anime she's watched recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right, right.
- It was weeks ago for us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I was like, after
me finally having seen it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a while back, I was like,
"Oh, I think this might be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a perfect time right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> since we're already
talking about the Anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to kind of go into it a little
bit, talk about it, right?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Give our thoughts on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Our hot takes, if you will. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And my hot take of "Jujutsu
Kaisen" was me saying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I thought it was okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor and Garnt giggling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then followed by, "I
just prefer "Demon Slayer"." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> As an show, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's a fucking highlight clip. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, you are clown for that opinion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I gotta admit, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe, I don't know, the new
season though is kind of tough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, at the time of recording though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that was a clown take,
but now, okay, maybe not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, was it clown take though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's literally... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause in the clip, I'm
pretty sure I said something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> along the lines of, "Jujutsu
Kaisen" had everything that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought I was going to like." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But for some reason, whatever it was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't even give a proper,
viable reason for it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to just say that for some reason, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just didn't really click in my head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Never did I say that the show was like mid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or that the show was bad in any way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I just said, "I thought it was okay." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Twitter went ballistic over that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there were a couple of videos- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How ballistic are we talking? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Just a few angry people or? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, Twitter does what
Twitter does best, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just over blows everything
outta proportion, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I even had a couple
of people tweeting at me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> videos from small AniTubers being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Joey, you're getting canceled." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Oh, God, what now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is it for something I liked
on Twitter? I don't know." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I went to look at it and it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Joey's hottest take on "Jujutsu Kaisen"." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And on the thumbnail, it just says, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "He thought it was okay." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Oh, my God!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't even call a show okay anymore </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> without being canceled! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, what the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So that's layer one, all right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Layer two is when I started watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Demon Slayer" season two recently, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I made a tweet, first tweet
in six months about Anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> where I said something along the lines of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Started watching season
two of "Demon Slayer" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happy to say Zenitsu is still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the worst character in the show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All the Zenitsu fans
went ballistic, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> As they do.
- Of course they do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - As they do, calling him
best boy and whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] They stand up,
wearing those diapers... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Just pooping violently with rage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "How dare you-" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (imitating sharting noises) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You know?
(Garnt and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then some people took it back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to that recent fucking clip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of me talking about "Jujutsu Kaisen", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saying that "Demon Slayer" is
better than "Jujutsu Kaisen." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they had the audacity to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, now he's backpedaling! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now he's backpedaling! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He hyped up "Demon Slayer" so much, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> even comparing it to "Jujutsu Kaisen", </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saying it was better
than "Jujutsu Kaisen", </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and now he's saying that 'Demon
Slayer' is not a good show." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which I never said, mind you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just said Zenitsu fucking
sucks because he does. Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, he does. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's like, if anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm fucking enjoying season two right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Season two's been great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel season two's kind of brought back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the hype for "Demon Slayer"
for a lot of people, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wasn't that hyped, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but season two has made
me definitely hyped. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like the like movie, as... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, God, is this gonna be
another fucking hot take? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> As okay as I thought the movie was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, okay, okay, I'll agree with you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought that season two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> has blown the movie out of the water. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you know what? I'm gonna say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I recently just finished
my Anime of the year video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like Anime has
gotten so much better now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that just saying something is okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is now detrimental to the Anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not even bad anymore.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Calling something mid is an insult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and calling something okay is an insult. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like it's a copy paste now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where everyone is like,
"'Attack on Titan' is mid." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's basically a copy paste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone that keeps
saying that exact phrase. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No elaboration. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Attack on Titan is mid." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it's such easy bait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it is! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's literally bait, but everyone does it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the thing is, I didn't even say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Jujutsu Kaisen" is okay for bait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just legitimately think it's just okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really like "Jujutsu Kaisen". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that's fine, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There were parts of "Jujutsu
Kaisen" I really enjoyed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but I personally didn't enjoy
it as much as other people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or as I thought I was going to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, do you feel like
saying something is okay or mid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is even more of an insult </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than saying something is bad nowadays? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I feel like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like I've just, at
least in discussing shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or Anime or whatever, or Manga, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like you don't see as many people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just saying something is
straight up bad anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People just say, "Oh,
it's mid. It's just mid." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, okay, I get the word mid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mid is insulting.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause mid is so little effort </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to articulate how you feel about a show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can't even get the energy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to even describe what
you don't like about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so annoying.
- I feel like the word average </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when talking about a show, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like a contention between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> okay being taken more in a positive way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then mid being taken
in a negative way, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But they both mean the same
thing, technically speaking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Mid is just short for middle! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is okay! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Neither good or bad, just okay, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I feel now people take the word okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and put a negative spin
on it, which I don't- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I get it. I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, let's say you
had a wedding, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- And you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Mom, did you like the wedding?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> She's like, "It was okay." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would be annoyed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I would be like, "What do you
mean my wedding was just okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I invited you I put on a
spread! You said it's okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The bar was free!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I feel it's kind
of on you to compare </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your own wedding to "Jujutsu Kaisen". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was gonna say! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's, how strongly I feel
about my best friend, okay! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, "How do we
get from "Jujutsu Kaisen" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to a wedding?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just thinking, let's
just say you pour your heart </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and soul out into something you like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Eh, it's okay." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm gonna go to Sydney
today and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Sydney, I know we're
getting married this year, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but like just "Jujutsu Kaisen", right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, it's kind of more
important than the wedding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I pour my heart into "Jujutsu Kaisen" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> more than I did the
wedding and the planning." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] You know that
there are people out there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that would say that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hope somebody asked me,
"How was Garnt's wedding?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I know what I'm gonna say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I already know what I'm gonna say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "I preferred "Jujutsu Kaisen" over it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, "I wish I could've
watched the new season." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "I feel like he poured his
heart more into "Demon Slayer". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Honestly, he is more
passionate about that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So my advice to all of you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> who perhaps want to share
your opinion about Anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't use the word okay from now on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It can get you canceled. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's just 'cause
of who we are, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's 'cause now we have this little show, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we do this little thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This little show, yeah.
- This little show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I think there's
a lot more eyes on us, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so people wanna get angry at what we say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause a lot of the times the people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who get annoyed at this stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> aren't the people who
actually watch Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There's people outside of Trash Taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who maybe have some followers
who've watched Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe seen some of the clips
or whatever and they're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "You won't believe what these guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who I don't already watch
or engage with said." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They don't know how we behave </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or how we go towards a
topic or how we tackle it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like, he just said this thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I disagree with it. I'm gonna get angry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's really weird, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially about my
"Jujutsu Kaisen" hot take, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "hot take", is the fact that
I called "Jujutsu Kaisen" okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> months ago on my own channel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No one fucking batted an eye. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I say it on Trash Taste,
everyone loses their minds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think 'cause it's Trash Taste, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's weird, 'cause I feel
we've got to that point now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where not super small Twitter accounts, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but some Twitter accounts
with some decent followings </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> will be like, "This clown
take on Trash Taste XXX." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I think that's also kind of cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Oh, that's
awesome that people feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> we're big enough where they
could just openly criticize us." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Go ahead, man!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is humbling to think
that my offhand comment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> about an Anime has stirred
up this much controversy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it's kinda cool, but
at the same time, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> can you not cancel me for
saying that a show is okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I could candidly sleep over it if somebody </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> gets angry at me on Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I not sleeping over it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's a little like, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm glad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Imagine back four or five years ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if I'd said the same shit,
no one would give a fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one would care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm glad that people care! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes it's annoying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a little too much.
- But I love it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Thank you for caring about
my dumb opinion about a show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't care about Joey's
opinion, so you shouldn't! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't even care about my opinion! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just said it! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I think the argument
is that we are creators </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> who have a platform and an influence. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, that's why they
call people like us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> influencers, right?
(Joey retching) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Even though we fucking hate the word. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm allergic to that word. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love it, actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've got that evil voice going for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I feel like it works </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when someone calls me
an influencer, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just the one thing I
don't like about out that word </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is that it can apply to
so many things, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A cult leader is technically
an influencer as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Those are the OG influencers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're the OG influencers, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if I wanna be bunched up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in those kinds of people.
- I'm kidding, by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't actually like the word. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like to think that I make something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's somewhat entertaining and good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm just a dude on the internet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] I don't know, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - With a bunch of hot takes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I get it to a certain extent, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> where we do have to be careful about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of the stuff we say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause there are some topics that I feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> we do have to navigate very carefully. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because there are
other creators out there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who do have a platform, and their words, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they say shit and their
words have a tangible effect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> on the real world and the
community they talk to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but at the same time,
there are some things that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> blows my mind that people
care this much about, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And one of the biggest things
that I don't understand is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people will take this one
minute, two minute clip </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from Trash Taste or
from one of our streams. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause this happened to me
a bunch of times, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where I will see this
clip being circulated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's a one or two minute clip </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from the podcast or my
stream that's not scripted, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just in a conversation
that's most of the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't even have anything to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the take that I'm
saying in that one clip </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's one or two minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they will take this clip </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then spin it to a whole new level of- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I get it, like you've
planned it all out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a fucking mastermind move. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I think of this in context, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm thinking, I don't
think people who watch our show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or people who are super fans of the show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is going to be influenced
by a one minute clip </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of us talking about this one subject </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that most of the time doesn't even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to do with the overall conversation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just most of the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just an offhand comment something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think that's gonna
fucking influence anybody. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But on that segment, Joey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you spoke about "Jujutsu
Kaisen" and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "No, you're a clown. It's good." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you're a viewer, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> how can you argue that you are
being influenced to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Jujutsu Kaisen" is mid or okay." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause there's an active argument going on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where we're saying, "No,
it's not. You're wrong." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So as the viewer, what would
you take away from that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not, "Oh, I'm gonna think
"Jujutsu Kaisen" is mid." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Even if you're a super fan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so stupid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's what I think I like about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those kinds of discussions on the show, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially when two or all of us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> are arguing against each other, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is that it gives so many
different points of views, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's up to the viewers now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who you want to agree with, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's not so much me saying, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey, because I think
"Jujutsu Kaisen" is okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you should also think that way." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, if you want to think
that way that's on you, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's not like I'm coming out here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking starting a demo of being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Everybody, stand up and rise! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Jujutsu Kaisen" is just okay!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And start a fucking coup
d'etat over it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like I'm just some fucking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, I just don't get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fine to be influenced
by certain things, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but at the same time, it's
like, it's just a show, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's a good
problem to have in our job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - People would spend many years </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to get to the point where, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well, we're very fortunate
where people watch Trash Taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and people care. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel very lucky that
people wanna get angry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> about small things I joke about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it a contention for
cancellation, though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Not sure about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I dunno, it goes back
to my online hate days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I've gone to the point now where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it doesn't really bother me
that much at all, really. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's interesting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think this is just 'cause
I've been online for so long now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where now I'm just kind
of in equilibrium with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I wouldn't even say it's because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm okay with it now or I'm numb to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think Jessica Nigri said it best. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She said, when someone
asked her about like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "How do you deal with internet hate? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How do you get over it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she said like, "You never get over it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It still hurts, but you
just learn to live with it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - To me, 'cause we have
talked about this a few times, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but to me, without getting
to the online hate thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the one thing that annoys me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> than just people actually
just hating on me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and hating on my content, for example, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is just when people are trying
to put words in my mouth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> To be like, "Garnt said this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or Garnt said this and that means X </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or that means X, Y, Z." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And to me, there's nothing that
wants to make me reply more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than people who are
spreading this idea that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the greatest bait of all though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is, right? It is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because at that point,
I've seen some instances </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I say one thing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it just spirals
out into this insane story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about how I fucking killed
a child or some shit, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's that level of how did you take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this one little piece of information </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and spin it in a way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that just couldn't be
further from the truth? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You are basically writing a
fan fiction at that point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then there are people
who look at that and be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, yeah. That sounds
like something he'd say." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've been thinking about that a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I swear to God, I don't
know if the Anime community </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was always like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Because, to me, there are some topics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I always used to love
arguing about, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I felt like, to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's some things where
you really have to be careful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> about what you say in terms of religion, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> politics and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hence the reason why we never
talk about it on the show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We've spoken about a
little bit on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But we try and avoid
it as much as we can. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you know, sometimes
you just want to have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a fun argument with someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you can just shit on their opinion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you don't have to worry about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you know that,
at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the topic doesn't really matter that much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And to me, as an Anime fan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Anime was always one
of those topics for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until quite recently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't know if
that's just my perception. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause another topic I would say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can easily argue with
anyone about is food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone loves arguing about food, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we do it all of the fucking
time, 'cause it's fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's fun because people understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that people have different
tastes and opinion, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And to me, Anime was
always at that same level, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as I can easily argue
about anyone with Anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and not have to worry about
hurting their feelings too much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I just assume
everyone in our community </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has an understanding that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Dude, you can have your own taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can have your own opinion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a mutual agreement
that at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> even if this one random internet person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't think that your
favorite shows as good as it is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, "Well, that's
not gonna deter me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> from the fact that I still
like this show, right?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's really just changed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just 'cause of the scale
of Trash Taste, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> There was nothing like
this back in the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Back on "PodTaku", what was
the average viewer count? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think our most viewed
podcast ever was 100K. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which back then was crazy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for a podcast, that's insane.
- Yeah, it was crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Obviously the scale is
completely different now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Anime has also been somewhat
more democratized in a way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Democratized.
- It's more readily available. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's more
available to more eyes now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a lot easier to get ahold of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And discourse about it is way more open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and people are way more
open to talk about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I think that's some of the reasons why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So the problem is
it's getting to popular. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing)
- Well, essentially! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You could almost say
it's becoming mainstream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kinda. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I always had this image that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the Anime community felt
like it was about 10, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> five, 10 years behind hat we saw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the gaming community, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it felt like
maybe the gaming industry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also had this shift where games used to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just these fun things you
numb your brain out to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it didn't really matter that much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You could just have your have fun with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then now games are a big business. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the same essentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I know that some people gave
"Zelda: Breath of the Wild" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a seven out of 10 when it came out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they got controversy for that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they didn't give it
a nine or 10 or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So basically they
got canceled for saying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Breath of the Wild" was just okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, they said it was just good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it's just good!
- Okay would be five! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> We've had the same thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the same thing again, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Isn't it incredible how one word </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can completely change everything? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> There's such a huge
difference in like insinuation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> between calling something good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and calling something just good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It could be the attitude
towards it as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think sometimes... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I can understand sometimes
the way you talk about Anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could definitely... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, "Yeah, it's mid." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I can understand
why you piss people off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because you sound like you won't even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> entertain the conversation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, I fucking hate the fact </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you even brought this up to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It was mid. Stop talking to me about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I can understand why
sometimes people can get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> annoyed by that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause they're like, "I wish
Joey just even listened to me." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like me trying to get
approval for my parents. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, "I wish my parents
just gave it a chance." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, "No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's shit. No."
- You're like, "It's mid." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think maybe that's what annoys people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and look, I can
completely get that as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And that is my bad, to be fair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But at the same time,
sometimes I don't even bother </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> engaging in these conversations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because I already know how it's gonna end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I get you, Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because it's just happened
so many times that- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've done this for almost nine years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know how a conversation
like this is gonna end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've known you for ages, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I know how you are
with these conversations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I could say I
could give out all these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> well thought out constructed arguments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about why I think the show is okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and people would be like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "But, but, but, but, but, but, but! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But I don't agree!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Oh my God,
what more can I say?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So what you're saying is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if Trash Taste started six years ago, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you might have got more
enthusiastic debate out of Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, this would actually
be an Anime podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing)
If it started six years ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I don't want an Anime podcast! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But no, it's not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not now.
- Its not now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thank God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Going back to the hate thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you always get asked
by new creators or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or anyone, how do you
deal with online hate? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> What's the advice that you give someone? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I've been mulling
this over a lot recently, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I think my opinion on
it has changed quite a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Since the last time
we talked about this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had this perspective shift
recently and I don't know why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the whole thing of
living with it and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is totally valid advice and
I think that's also good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I dunno what happened, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but now I look at it and
I don't really care at all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I see it, because to me in my head, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're never angry at me
as an individual person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I read that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're angry at like
what they think is me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're not angry at.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> If they sat with me and spoke with me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they probably wouldn't
feel that way, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But they're angry at the idea of me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and more often than not, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they were never gonna
give me a chance anyway, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I must be a
personality they don't like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, see, but I feel that
way of thinking about things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> has only been constructed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you've been doing
this for so long, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, definitely.
- And I don't think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there are very, very few people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who can come right into
this industry from the jump </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and have this enough self
confidence in themselves </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and their content and their
self image on the internet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to be like, "Well, that's not about me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's just about their image of me." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like, especially
when I started off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't have that kind of
fucking confidence, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm sure a lot of people didn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So anything, the moment
your name gets mentioned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in something, and even if it's not exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the most detrimental thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> jab at your personality or whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think people just not used to this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and having this random amount
of people coming up to you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and being like, "By the
way, you're kind of shit" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is a thing that we're not
really used to, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, the human wasn't
evolved to deal with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How many people just
walk down the street </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and have a random person be
like, "Excuse me, you're shit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It doesn't happen, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But on the internet, that's normal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's like New York. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who was it that said
people on the internet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have gotten way too used to saying things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and not getting punched
in the face for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah! No, absolutely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> There's no repercussion for it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They just think, "Oh, it's just free range </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to say whatever the fuck I want." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, sorry. Go ahead.
- Oh, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was about to say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and yes, in a sense, it
is kind of free range </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to say whatever you want,
but with repercussions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can say whatever you want, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as long as you are willing
to pay for the repercussions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if they come back to you, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And they very may well might, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause I actually had
to train my mum up for this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> recently, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Course she's not getting hate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but sometimes she goes
through the Trash Taste videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and some of the streams and the comments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she finds these comments. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, "Garnt, I
want to reply right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna tell them that they're wrong!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "Mum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do not do that, Mum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's even worse, Mum!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your mum wants to call out the haters? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My Mom does that. Cause my Mom, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my Mom reads like so
many comments and like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she doesn't understand how to
like how to deal with online </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> hate, especially to like her own son. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So she's just, she just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well sometimes she'll just like, send me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a bunch of comments being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look at all these people saying
wrong information about you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna reply, I wanna reply- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that like a
Southeast Asian Mom thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause Archie's Mom does
exactly the same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where she had to be like,
Mom, stop sending me this shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Stop replying to this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just leave it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I literally love to explain to her. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, if a school
bully said something to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and you come up to the school
bully in front of everyone in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the school, and be like, don't
talk about my son like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, Mom, this looks even worse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And even if I replied
to her personally, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How did she take it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I told her not to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, just don't read it, Mom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I understand what you're going through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone who's a content creator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goes through this at the beginning, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but you just gotta understand
that people are just gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And actually couldn't be
more the opposite of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like my parents would be like, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my dad would be like, oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Some people are saying about
your last video. And I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really? He's like, yeah,
but they're all dicks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You'll be all right mate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Perhaps I'm just waiting for
the day where I wake up on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Twitter one day and then I
wake up to like a screenshot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's been spread viral about
my Mom replying to like one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of my haters coming, be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yo, have you seen what Garnt's
Mom said to this person?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like for fuck's sake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just wanna see a tweet
from your Mom being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the fuck did you say you little shit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (mumbles indistinctly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now you know, I have three
hundred confirmed kills. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. I love that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think we should read
some comments from your Mom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's-
- That yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that'd be good.
We should have a segment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We read out your mom's reply comments. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have your parents ever like
looked through your comments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or looked through your videos? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> See what people are saying about you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I think my Mom one time was
like really sad about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why are they saying mean things
there's on this one thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about you. Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not a big deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - She's like,
- It's so cute though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. She was way more
upset about it than I was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. I was like, don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But obviously, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's not normal to see
people bad mouth your son. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Son. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course.
- Of course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not a normal thing.
You get to experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course - It's quite
a visceral emotion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean I'd be lying if I said if, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> my kid was in that situation, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't do the same thing, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah. I probably
want to punch someone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd be like, don't
worry they're just dicks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like honestly I kind of get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm the same, I guess,
because I feel like more anger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> when I see you people shit
talking Sydney (mumbles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah. Same.
Like if I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just like if I see
one persons shit talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> one of my bros, I'm
just like fuck that guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanna fucking call them out now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I guess like if in that vein, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I think the one thing I hate
more than people taking my shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> outta context, right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and trying to cancel me for
something completely unrelated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is when they just like
drag my friend into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And especially people who
like don't matter at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, okay, you can
say shit about me, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I'll take care of that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That'll be my problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But don't drag people who have
nothing to do with this shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> don't drag in my girlfriend or
my friends or like my fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Mom or anything like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's got nothing to do with them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you hate my opinion, just shit talk me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll deal with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll cry into my own pillow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I don't want people
shit talking other people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's like the one thing
I hate, don't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You're a dick if you do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're a dick if you do that. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> That's joinhoney.com/trashtaste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is all like, what
is it like quarterly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> YouTube Twitch ran podcast I'd say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, yeah. I know a lot
of people might not empathize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with us 'cause we do talk about it a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I dunno if for an
audience is tiring ever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I kind of feel like we- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's therapy session. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We need this every once in a while. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Otherwise we do gonna have
like this half emotion in us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And we just every so often
I just need to let out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course I just need to let out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like for content
creators, it's healthy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like to me being able to talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to other content creators about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a healthy way to get all
of this like toxicity out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yourself and just get on with your life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think before Trash Taste
definitely would need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to talk to another content
creator every now and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just rant. Just needed it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's better to rant
to another content creator </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> than do it on a video or on a stream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got a question. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you guys ever like tried
to explain when you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> going through some controversy
or something's going on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to try and explain it
to someone who just does not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> understand YouTube and
it's just more involved in- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah.
- It doesn't work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a little annoying right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It'll pass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> No, like, no hate against anyone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We explain this to,
because to their credit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they tried their hardest to
understand what's going on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember I had to like pretty
early on in my career when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was getting that first
initial wave of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you're notable enough in the
community now where people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> outside of your community </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'll find people some
people shit talking you- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Part of it was me.
- Something like that, yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What did you say Joey.
- I mean it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just kidding. But like when
you first start to get that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> first wave and you're like,
Oh fuck, I don't know who to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talk to about... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno, I'm getting canceled. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Blah, blah, blah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Even though it was like
barely nothing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember I was talking to
one of my schoolmates about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being like, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like these bunch of people like coming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into my comment section saying that I suck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and blah, blah, blah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember one of them
was just straight up, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Just tell 'em to fuck off!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, yeah, thought about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Not an option unfortunately, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when it's one of me and many others, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> who I'm up against not
really that easy, Is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. 'Cause- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If only it was that easy- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If only 'cause like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember like every time
I've tried to explain something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's been going on in
this YouTube's field, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some controversy, you're
just like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So this person said this and
it's pissing a bunch of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> off like, holy shit,
Twitter's getting angry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you talk to the
person they're like, oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why people getting angry? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you just, like-
- I said, this Anime was bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well so this person
said this Anime was bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and these group of people
got pissed off about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they goes, so why
are they pissed off about it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you keep going layers
and layers deep until you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to a point where they just
forget what the original </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like what people are
getting angry for about- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or it's to the point where
you're like the more arguments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> come through and the
more layers down it goes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you just start to realize,
wait, it's not a problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's no problem to begin
with. I'm just making it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean, like I remember
back in the day where drama </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> could be addressed with
just one short Tweet longer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And now it's got to a point
where you need like a four hour </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> breakdown to understand
like the full depth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of some of this drama. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I dunno when that shift happened, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> when it was just like, okay,
now you need a fucking thesis. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's a full on dissertation
to break down the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a play by play of like
the entire month leading up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to this one tweet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Except instead of one
professor like marking it down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the entirety of
the internet being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But did you use correct citations for it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No marks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do we have the receipts?
- Do you have the receipts? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. It's crazy how, especially
that side of the internet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has evolved, especially like,
I think, drama culture is kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of a thing now where- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, it's definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, I see some content
creators who start off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing their own thing... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and a lot of people I've seen,
have just slowly shifted into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like drama channels, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe intentionally
maybe not intentionally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it seems like every other
lot blow seems to be talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about some kind of drama or
some kind of controversy that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> going on.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's very good for business though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's one of those things
where if you are in drama </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that isn't really drama, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you said you have a bad take on Anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something, all right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Those kind of drama are just
generally just good for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because there's no real
downside 'cause nobody </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who actually watches you gives a fuck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you said a show is bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like when I said 86, I
didn't like 86 right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a lot of people mad about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I doubt there was
many people who are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't watch Trash Taste
or Connor ever again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause you said my favorite show is bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But maybe other people
who are watching you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or some people outside of it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> see this drama and think this
is really fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not gonna check them out or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm more familiar with their
name through this drama. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause drama is a really good way of... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like a click on a
drama video is like much more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> engaging than a normal clip. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So when you get like a
million views on a drama </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The million views on that
drama video and maybe that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> such a generic gaming
video, they're not equal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the drama engagement and how
much people are invested is so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And especially if it's something
that paints you in a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> light or paints you in a way
that makes it look like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't really do anything.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then it's just great
for you because then now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just gonna get people
who are more invested in you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> People who think that
you've been done wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then they're gonna support you more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So when these people do this
shit they try and drag you in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the drama, this is why a
lot of big Twitch streamers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get into this kind of drama very often. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause it's really good for
solidifying your base viewership </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They wanna support you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They they will help you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then people who see it and think, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they weren't really in the wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They might come and check
you out and feel a bit more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> strongly about you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause they wanna support you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause they feel like
this is some bullshit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was done to you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like a drama video is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> especially in multiple successions, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Of the same drama, like every day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's almost like the world's
most engaging Let's play. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> In a sense where you are more likely, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you are really into like a drama video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you are more likely to come
back to that part than a regular </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gaming video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's just the
modern day reality TV show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause like here's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you think people
actually care about drama? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you think people like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Only when it's like clearly
like there is a wrong person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who did a shit thing, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like 90% of YouTube drama's not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think there will be a
core audience that does feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> betrayed but I think the
majority people are there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just for the popcorn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah
- I mean, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause, I remember like
the most recent drama </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I can remember happening off
the top of my head right now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the one that involved
"Pokemon" and "Ninja" right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And obviously that
got like a lot of views </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it came out and a lot
of people were discussing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I remember like my first
initial reaction to hearing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about this drama that
was going on was okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the fuck happened? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It really hard to figure
out what was going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was so hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As a content creator, I
was like trying to fucking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> piece it together who was mad at who, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who did wrong to who, how did
it lead to this situation? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And they were like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like it took Philly D
five minutes to explain it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's a lot for Philly D. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm just thinking- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - One minute Russia's
invading one minute for that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then five minutes of
"Pokemon" and "Ninja" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Legit, it was like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like the majority
of the video. It was crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had like an easier time
understanding some of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> world situation going on right
now and the world politics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than like how this drama started
and the evolution of this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> drama. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like, so surreal
like trying to figure out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what was going on ,right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because if me as a content
creator who knows the content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> creators within this drama was
like having trouble figuring </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out because I wasn't there
right at the beginning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't imagine how a
general audience feels, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they're it seems like
people are just seeing people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talk about this on their
timeline and they don't even know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get to a point where you
kind of are waiting for someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to tell you who you should be angry at, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right?
- Or who's in the wrong- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that's the problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel 90% of drama is not
so much about trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uncover the details,
gathering the receipts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and doing like a fucking
criminal investigation to who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> started it and who's the
culprit, who's the victim. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's literally just you
see a piece of drama, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the "Pokemon" and "Ninja" one right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And 90% of the audience just goes, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so who am I rooting for? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Gimme two people to root for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Gimme two people to fight for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, it's "Ninja" and "Pokemon" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, I like that person
better just from the one thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've heard about them so
I'll just root for them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause it's not always
the case, but yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of it is like that though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You have to admit a lot of it's like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Especially if you're not in
that community or don't give a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shit about that community.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know like if a bunch
of fucking fashion YouTubers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get into some drama, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like that's what they want though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. But that's what they want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not going to care about the details. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All I'm going to care about is okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So who are the two people in question? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And what is the general
consensus on these two people who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are fighting? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like that's all it is to
me. Like other than that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't give a shit personally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Even though it's good for business, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think a lot of
these Twitch streamers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> try to get into this stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some of them maybe do... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know that. I don't
try to but I'm just brash </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with my words and also not
very good at explaining </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my arguments on the spot as
we all know from Trash Taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I end up getting into these things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - A lot of people aren't
good at explaining </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their arguments on the
spot, which I think is where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the problem stems from. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause, I would like to
think that we're all very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> well spoken and are on the board- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can be well spoken but like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I want to be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can be, you can be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's hard where you have so
many hours of content around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yourself, just talking and
just not just Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but Twitch streamers as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially with Twitch streamers
where they are basically on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> camera, live in an audience
like eight hours a day plus, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's going to be a time
where you are not as careful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with your words where you slip up a bit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's just going to happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it will happen to anyone
in the same situation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Absolutely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's deep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That deep (laughs), </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's deep Man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That hit me right there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That deep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Damn that's deep. God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That's deep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You know something that Twitch
streaming is made me feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I really feel a lot more strong
about the viewers who like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> turn up like every day to the shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you when you're YouTubing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I see that fucking... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who's that ninja guy who
comments on every video? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The guy without (mumbles)- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like there's like
500 of these channels right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like the same
people can't whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like on the Twitch I know
a bunch of the names of people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who like turn up every single time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> There's this person called
BlueSkyDays who every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> single stream gives me five subs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I feel like they've
made it into a ritual. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I swear there you go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is your shout out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Thank you, I really appreciate it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Again, going back to the hate
stuff it's like, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> When I think about getting sad
about some people not liking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what you do or whatever, I'm like, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like how much more would
it hurt me If I had to explain, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to say that person who
maybe turns up all the time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Hey, by the way, I'm
quitting. I don't like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause some people said
mean things about me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like seeing that person be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, you're gonna quit, but
I like watching your stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That would hurt me way more
than anything anyone could say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course,
- Connor's fell off ratio, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever that nothing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean to me, I feel the same
with like some of my patrons </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I have patrons
who have been fans of me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> who have been watching me
since like 10 years ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something and they've
been there since the start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of when I opened my patron
and they're still with me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to this day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like that's fucking insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Shout out to all you guys in
the patron discord server, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like having my patron and
discord server because it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a very close knit
community and it's nice having </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just familiar faces that have
just, stuck with you for that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It makes you feel, what's
the word not validated, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but just happy that you
kind of do what you do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Very much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I definitely feel that way
as well about YouTuber friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who were there since the
very beginning, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have a couple who were
still around back when I had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking less than a thousand subs, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was doing like gaming
videos and shit like that... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Again, same thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> If I were to just one day, be like, yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I kind of just fucking hate this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> People are shitting on
me, blah, blah, blah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like betraying a
family member at this point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> They've been there, they've
seen thick and thin of me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and being like, nah, dude, you got this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they've believed
in me the entire time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then for me to just be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't take a bunch of people
giving me shit for saying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that "Jujutsu Kaisen"
was okay then I'm sorry- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was considering it in the podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like fuck Joey- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have to go I'm sorry
- He's ignorant as fuck </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Didn't like "Jujutsu Kaisen".
I'm done. It's over with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't say I didn't like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, It's okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You didn't come. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's it's just okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is offensive to
everything I hold dear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The more you say it, the
more offensive it sounds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Stop, stop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno how this is happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Am I supposed to
rephrase? It was average. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't average. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not even gonna entertain
you on this, it was better than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> average, come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why do you think I don't
wanna start these conversations? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - These are the kind of people
that'll say it's average and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then give "Love Life" a seven
out 10 you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't stand this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't even want get into "Love Life" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> dude, are you kidding me? Fuck that! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is the conversation.
- All the "Love Life" fans- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is the conversation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not gonna engage in for good reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know a lot of "Love Life"
fans I'm hating on you guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sorry- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They won't take it that way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They'll be like, I can't
believe you took this as a joke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Here goes my L this week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's your cancellation for the week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was gonna say we're very
fortunate that in YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's quite difficult to have
good friendship with other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTubers for a long period
of time, just 'cause of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the nature of the job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just, things change,
people get busy, people move, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> people get on with their
life, do different content, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fall off ratio, all that kind of stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the work. So, we're very very lucky </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there were some good
friends and we've been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> friends with a very long time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We all happen to kind of be
around the same kind of sphere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and do the same thing, same time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And it all kind of worked out very lucky. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I think that's like
another thing as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> If we're going back to
helpful advice for people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> starting off, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like another one that I get often, as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh what do I do about collabing and stuff? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I feel that's like
the easiest way to grow out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your channel from an
early stage. And I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yes, in a sense, if you do it right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But you shouldn't be like
a channel with 200 subs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and fucking DM-ing Felix,
to collab with you, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You gotta know your boundaries
and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And also like another piece of
advice that I saw on Twitter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the other day which I
thought was very true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think a lot of YouTubers
especially those starting off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> have this weird misunderstanding
that they think everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who collabs with them is
also a friend of theirs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that is just, unfortunately not true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There are a lot of people who
just see it as business who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just want to do this one time
thing or just to do this thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to benefit themselves. But also, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the person they're collaborating with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's almost unhealthy to
see a person who you collab </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> with as just your mate, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like there's a very big
difference between a collaborator </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and an actual friend. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think once you've really
fully started to understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at an early stage and really
gone and thought to yourself, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay, who is actually my friend? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like someone who will hang out
with me when the cameras are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not rolling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And who is someone that is
just there for the clout? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you have a hard
time drawing that line? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No
- No </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've done this for long
enough now where I know- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like being an adult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God forbid, I've become an adult, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you kind of learn to
just vibe with people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes you don't vibe with people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes you really love what they make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you really like how they go about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And sometimes you hang out with them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and it just didn't click,
it's kind of weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The conversation wast little, Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And other times it's like, holy shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I gotten so well with this person, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then maybe you feel
that way and they don't, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is this is experience
thing we have to learn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All right. Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Even if I really like that
person, I liked hanging out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with them, I want to talk to them again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You gotta be like normal about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't be like, let's hang
out next day. Let's do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I space it out of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I don't know
how we got to like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how we became super close, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I remember there was
definitely a time when I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah, these guys are cool, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I don't wanna like burden them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't wanna text them too much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I remember when I met
Garnt we didn't really talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in between hanging out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was kind of like we'd hang out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it was like a
thing, I don't really know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, you sent me a fucking email. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - An email, I dunno how that work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would've put that right in the trash. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm the type of guy who
really connects with someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> hanging out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hanging out personally or physically- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt needs to touch your
face, make your sweat suck your- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know the fuck
you're talking about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was sexually harassing you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are not a friend of
mine until I suck your dick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt is Harvey white. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was going to mention I'm
the type of guy who might not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> talk so much like online or on the phone- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I was joking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt does not sexually harass people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was just visual,
like whiplash for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I was trying to
make this poignant point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and it just kind of goes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Garnt sucks dick, he's like sweat" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just what did I say? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What did I say? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can confirm that was
a weird time at the onset. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Pretty sure I was told that what he did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Because I remember
we didn't message too much, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I had a fun time hanging
out whenever we did hang out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in person and we just ended up
hanging more times in person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess it just happened naturally, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Going from what you said
about being friends versus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> collaborators, even me as
someone who doesn't collab </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> too much, I barely collab at
all, as a content creator... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There are some content creators
who you enjoy that content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you really respect
the work that they do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But there are some people
that you just think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I probably wouldn't get along with you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love the work you do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I probably would
not get along with you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And on the opposite end,
there are also other people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who you don't like their content, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but maybe I can get along with this guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Seems like it seems like
a chill dude or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's that whole thing of
like separating the artist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> from the art. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is way easier said
than done in a lot of cases. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It's just tough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just feels like it's been
so long since I've been able </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to meet a lot of new content
creators who I've watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because of the past two years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because we've only been able
to meet people in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I feel normally like
you get a point every year </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you get to this opportunity
to fly out out to America </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or fly out to somewhere,
fly out to conventions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and actually meet fellow content creators. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've forgotten what
that feels like now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've forgotten what it feels
like to have the first awkward </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> meeting of oh, hey I watch your stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like what you do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean like, thanks. Wanna take a photo? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just getting to
speak English to people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I just wanna speak English to someone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you remember the first
time you met someone online? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Who you knew online? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But you'd never like met in real life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you remember what that feeling's like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause one of the biggest
things I first noticed it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> always height. Always Heights. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They are never the height
you expect them to be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. Absolutely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true on my end as
well, because every time someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> meets me that's the first
comment. Every time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's either height or
depending on if you're a content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> creator who shows their face or not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's also like how they look as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I definitely got that when I
first met John Super Eyepatch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Wolf because almost all his videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he never shows his face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So for the longest time people
didn't know what he looked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like and then obviously
when he first blew up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone was like, all the
AnimeTubers were like this guy's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> content's fucking amazing. It's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would love to meet him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then when we heard
that he was coming to AX, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like a fucking AX guest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> He was like, yo hype, Super
Eyepatch Wolf is coming to AX </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dude, let's fucking go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you go to the gathering. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there's a bunch of faces
there that you think might be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Super Eyepatch Wolf, all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But you don't know who, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Because you've never seen his face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then when you meet him, finally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember the first I said to John, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "I'm sorry if this is weird, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you are like really hot." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, he is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I was a chick, I would
be head over heels for him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's the Sigma male. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He really is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And luckily he took it in like a good way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That fucking jaw line man
dude, John, please that man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, he could break
bricks with that jaw. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's crazy how hot he is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why aren't you not more on camera? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I Know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You need to show your face more John. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You're a good looking dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Although he did buy a Dell
computer that was gonna- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was a great video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Imagine buying a Dell computer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It couldn't be me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - When it comes to like looks as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but also like physique
and as you said height. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I get my height pointed
at all the goddamn time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and I never thought that
would be a weird thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you ever meet up
with people online often </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before YouTube was ever that
a thing you ever used to do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, not really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. 'Cause I feel like I
made online friends because of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And not the other way around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So especially during the
pandemic with more people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> making friends online, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure a lot more people are
going to be experiencing this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experience, but it was like
an alien experience to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the first times I did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, it's still weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I never get used to meeting
someone who I know online. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And especially if they're
like a content creator, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it feels so weird now 'cause
I'm a content creator and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been on the other side of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And sometimes I just don't know
how to approach someone who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whomst I know that's- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's that feeling of meeting
that content creator that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you've only seen in video in person and, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the first thing that
pops into your mind is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've only ever seen you behind a screen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That mentality never dies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even though I'm also in that
same position now to that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so weird. One of
my first thoughts is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, that's what the back
of their head looks like." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it's just not an
angle you've ever seen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's just weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so surreal seeing
this angle, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> " Is that that person?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's just like, Oh
wait, no, it is that person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I kinda get what you mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had this really painful
fucking cringe thing I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right.
- All right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was at an AX party, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was chilling and you kind
of bump into people that you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> somewhat recognize or maybe you know them, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you've spoke to them once, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you go over and say hi and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was at this party and
there was a group of people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like five content creators, influencers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever you wanna call them.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That I didn't really know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's one person who
I saw them and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, I know that person. I
had just met them in the UK </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I went over to go say hi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "Oh hi, nice
to see you, how you doing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we hung out in the UK" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Turns out it wasn't that person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I had mistaken them. And I
thought it was them and I shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You not... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I hadn't even drank that much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like one, one or two drinks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And even though I like
wasn't drunk at all, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I somehow sobered up, even
though I'm still sober. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like sorry about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, yeah, I know you and stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and she's like it's not me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, Oh, you really
look like this person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I really thought you this person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could have maybe died on
this sword and get out my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> phone and be like, you
look really like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but no, it wasn't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And yeah, it was a really
awkward thing where I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, that's really embarrassing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm really sorry about that,
- Yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hope you guys have
a good time. Ignore me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I walked away really awkwardly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, why am I so cringe? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you met fans who have
kind of been like that as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> well? Like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I don't care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm indifferent towards
it, but I know it's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess that's how they feel, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like five content
creators. It's like, great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Now they're all gonna think,
I'm this fucking weirdo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That just approaches people and
goes, "Are you this person?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's me, look. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Gotta think I'm blind.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then when I went home,
whatever, I followed the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So was it another
content creator or was it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was another content creator, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was mistaking them with
another content creator </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who happened to be in like the
same field and stuff as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was also really
awkward 'cause I'm sure... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they recently followed me on
Twitter and I wonder if they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember me going up to them
like three years ago doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If I ever meet them,
I'm gonna ask them again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if they remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - My favorite interaction of
that that's kind of similar, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I was on the opposite end though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Was in Singapore AFA when I
went with Garnt and there was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this one moment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll never fucking forget. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sorry if you watch this show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was walking with Garnt and
Allen and Sydney through the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> convention hall.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I was on my way to
something and this dude spots me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from across the hallway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's looking me dead
in the fucking eyes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm like, Oh, he clearly knows me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I just kind of waved
to him or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he came up to me and he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh my God. Are you GiggUK?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember that I was
standing right behind you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And imagine me this kid
so excited calling me GiggUK </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and me having to go, No, but he is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt mumbles indistinctly)
I totally forgot about that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And Garnt's was just
like, Yep. I'm GiggUK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I remember
thinking, I don't even know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how to feel about this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> There was a split second where I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this is a bit right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> This is a joke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just like, should
I be happy or offended? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not sure. But I kind
of feel both right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Happy that obviously someone recognized me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but someone knows me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But unhappy that I was literally
standing right here and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they go to Joey and goes, love
you, watch Joey, love you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Watch Garnt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love your videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Love your videos GiggUK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Love those Anime minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like yeah, you supposed
to talk to him about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What did they do when you talk to him? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - At first I thought it was
like kind of a joke, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Being like, Oh, I'll just
say it's Joey ha ha ha funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was waiting for him to be
like, Nah, I'm just kidding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then actually turned towards Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But the moment I kind of pointed to Garnt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and he looked at Garnt
his smile just dropped. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was like, Oh God, I
have made a horrible mistake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I am so was sorry to the both of you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean he still knew me though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I guess he just mixed
me and Garnt's usernames up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, he might have-
- Yeah, he might. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's a was nice kid so whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But it was one of the funniest
interactions I've seen just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experienced as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you ever had that
point where you told your fan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something and they said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, I loved when you did X video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you think to yourself
I didn't do that video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't do that video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - My favorite is when they're like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes I do
- Sometimes I do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - If we're like having more
than a five minute conversation, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like I didn't make that video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But sometimes they just
say this one comment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and they leave and I'm just
like, I won't ruin their day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't wanna think they
messed up, I don't care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - My favorite for those that
I never have the heart to tell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them is when they're really
trying to sell you on the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that they've been a fan
for a really long time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, Oh Joey,
I love your stuff, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been watching you
since 2010 man, Like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's great and I'm like, all right, bye. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then at the back of my head, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I started in 2013. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't really have the heart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was in high school in 2010. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it would be scary if you
knew me back then Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But I don't have the heart to tell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna be that guy, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To be like fake fan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna to do that to them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dunno if I told this story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know I've told you guys this story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno if I said on the podcast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was the meetup I did
with Book Walker at AX. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where I just signed and took
pictures, the one Sydney, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he got like (mumbles) interrupting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And the line was pretty long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was very happy with
myself. I was like, wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> People actually want to
come and hang out with me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how long the line took. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe like 30 minutes. I don't know how... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it was capped. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we all capped like an hour, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Whatever study minutes and I'm doing that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And one guy comes up to me
and I'm like, holy shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a guy here. He's like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is back in your (mumbles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like it wasn't guys, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I appreciate it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, oh thanks man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I'm like, Yo,
hi, how you doing, man? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He was like, oh, I'm good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then we take a photo and he is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah man, could you sign
this "Goblin Slayer" book? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I really like the work you did on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like coming in, he's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you not the author
for "Goblin Slayer"? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, (Garnt laughing) No </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> He was like, Oh, but I
thought this was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a "Goblin Slayer" booth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, No, I'm a YouTuber. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And in my head I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Did this guy like look at the name on it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know who the author
of "Goblin Slayer" is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm guessing he
doesn't look like a Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - His name's Kagyu Kumo. So
it's very different, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe this guy was like, I do not judge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do not see race. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do not see country,
race, ethnic background. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, I'm open to all walks of life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe a white guy from
Wales could have written </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a light novel and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This boy is very new. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Homegrown (mumbles) if
that's the case. Holy shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I felt so bad for this kid because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't care that he confused me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but this guy was so embarrassed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd never seen a face drop that fast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause we'd taken the photo
shit and too on his phone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, you can go
delete that. I won't be mad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I signed this thing as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I signed his "Goblin Slayer" book </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then he tells me he loved
my work on "Goblin Slayer" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> What was that a Goblin? or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't know what I
did on "Goblin Slayer" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno if I should be
the defender or not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's so funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I remember having
this one conversation once </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a fan, sometimes you
get into like pretty intense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> conversation with fans
about some of your videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something when you have the time to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I remember this one
fan I think it was like AX </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or one of the Anime conventions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And we got into this conversation
about "Bleach" right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And at this point I've said
my takes about "Bleach" a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whether on my videos, my first
video was a "Bleach" video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in other videos and podcasts (mumbles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But was just okay.
- Huh? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you say it was just okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not gonna open that
box of worms right now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like I remember- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can of worms. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not gonna open that kind of worms. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So now, I remember were
having this fucking intense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> conversation about "Bleach" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he kept saying things like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember when you said this
about the quick (mumbles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like this about Tite
Kubo, can you expand on that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I don't agree with this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we were like having
this full debate about this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember thinking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't remember saying
this about "Bleach" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I might have said that about "Bleach". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm just going to entertain
the idea of this debate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that he's having about me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so we go into this like
10 minute fucking debate about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Bleach" right?
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then at the end, I'm
just like, yeah, I finally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understand your Fall of "Bleach" video now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like, that was John's video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And at that point, I didn't
even have the heart to tell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> him 'cause I'm just like, we've
been talking about a video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I didn't make for 10 fucking minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and having a strong debate about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How did he not realize that your voice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and John's voice is like
completely different? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like how did I not realize
that he was talking about a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> video that I didn't make? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause the thing is, I've talked
so much shit about "Bleach" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that sounds like something
I might have said. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've talked a lot of
things about "Bleach". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I might have said that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wasn't you arguing your opinions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was you agreeing with John. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was arguing John's opinion
without me being involved. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Step aside John, I got this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I got your back bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hope John appreciates that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You showed that guy out last year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did. I did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> John, I'm fighting the good fight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> John, I'm fighting the fucking good fight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's got his boxing gloves on for you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like he's fighting back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's also that thing where
I have said so much stuff in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my years of being online that
I have forgotten a good chunk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of any jokes or anything I've made. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I've had those awkward
moments where someone will make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a reference a video of mine
from like five, four years ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'll be like, What did you say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - They said the thing and I'm like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Why did did I say that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now the worst is when
they ask you to say it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Be like, I love this video that you made. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Can you say that one line? And I was like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know I say it.
- No, but it's when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't remember what
they're talking about when it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a video from a Let's
Play from six years ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, say that one thing
you said in "Corpse Party" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in episode 42. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Remind me how it goes again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's oddly specific. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Why would someone ask you that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've had that before in the past, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I've made over a thousand videos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't remember every single one I made. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It's been
extrapolated even fucking more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with Trash Taste now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where I will get comments
or I'll get like people- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm so excited to have
people bring up my opinions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I've totally forgotten. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause, I've had conversations
with people I've met here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who obviously watch Trash
Taste and they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and they say to me,
remember when you said this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, did I say that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, that kind of
sounds like something I said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't remember when I said
it, but like the "Bleach" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> video, I'm just going to
assume that you are right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I did say that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So let's just, entertain this idea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and have this conversation.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Basically if you meet me
in a convention and you said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, you said this, what's
your opinion about it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm probably just gonna
entertain that idea regardless of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whether I said it or not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing)
- Let's talk about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love conventions so much, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is my weekly reminder
that I miss conventions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - God. I miss conventions so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm hoping out hope that we can- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well this year, be the year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - This year be the year I'm hoping- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm praying this of the year we finally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> get to go to conventions.
- Let's find out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- One day. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> in each serving. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's only 140 calories per serving. </SPEAKER_01>

gluten free, grain-free, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> soy free and low carb. </SPEAKER_01>

- I got the cocoa flavor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's got nice crunch to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Does it remind you of your childhood? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so delicious. You can
barely keep it in your mouth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It actually really good. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> me and Sydney have already
finished all of them because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're actually really, really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I actually came to

<SPEAKER_00> eating a bowl of these frosted ones. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause we have a lot of
things planned for this year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's outside of Japan,
not spawning anything more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> than just that, but I'm hoping
that I get to interact with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the biggest thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I missed the vibe of conventions, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't realize how
much I missed it until </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you couldn't go to it anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I just missed that whole
convention vibe and the positive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> air and the positive attitude
and having fun for a weekend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just love the ambiance
of a convention hall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the low murmur everywhere and it's like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like everyone's just excited- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So everyone's just there
and excited and it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can feel the hype of
the room and it's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love the energy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's smells. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was gonna say I didn't
think I would miss the smell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of stale sweats that
you like smell when like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the convention- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Speak for yourself.
I don't miss that, God- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't miss it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just miss that that reminds
me that I am at a convention </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this is the smell of a convention. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - When you walk into like a
clean room and you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> damn it man, it ain't
that AX smell though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It ain't that AX smell
- Air's too clean right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's too clean right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It definitely ain't the gaming area. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nah, there's not enough
precipitation in the air. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> There's not enough game of
precipitation in the air. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I should miss it so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So especially when you get
those it'll be like a few months </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or even like a year later
and someone they'll be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh I met Connor at X
and X. He was so nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, that makes my day, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even though that might become
a meme now someone will be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I met Connor at his Twitch
chat, he was so nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He called me an idiot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, I like being a dick online. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then in person I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh man, I just wanna be nice to everyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want the opposite of that to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh I met Joey at a
(mumbles). He was so nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have subscribed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I've had that one time actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Someone's like, Oh, Connor
was so rude or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't think I was
though I rarely would be rude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can scarcely be rude to myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Let alone like someone else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm only rude to my best mates. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's basically it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean sometimes you have to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're being ushered to somewhere, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes people will start like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh Joey, can I take a picture? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, I can't right now
actually I have to have to go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's only one of me and
many people who thankfully want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to hang with me- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hate being like, no,
I can't take a picture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want to, but handlers
and staff and what not and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - 1% Problems, eh? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're living a good life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Duty calls you sometimes- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Just people wanting to
take a photo with me, God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, I'll wake up in the morning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't imagine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> What do I do with all this attention? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm very, very grateful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm very grateful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Connor you've changed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You've changed Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I fell off the plus ratio. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Before you moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> did you guys get called
out by your username more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or by your real names? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Did anyone actually call
you by like Connor, Joey? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was always CDawg or
Sebastian occasionally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - They were like, "Yo Sebastian" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Remember that one
time we were in little Tokyo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We were in L.A in little
Tokyo and we were chilling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And then like, we were all
done with our delicious... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I didn't even have Japanese food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember I had beeb and bub which is- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like the like Korean
barbecue place, right? - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So we were leaving and it was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We were chatting and some girls
screamed like, "Sebastian" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, Oh God.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I was really just embarrassed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you guys were
fucking laughing at me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they called me Sebastian. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it was that moment
of like we all turn around and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we were like, "Oh I
wonder which Seba.... Oh!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And Connor's just like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is like been the
period where I was trying my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> goddamn hardest to get away from it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was like a reminder. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, yeah, definitely- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't care if someone did it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you can call me Sebastian.
I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it happened early
on where people at first were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> calling me Anime man or whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I from really
early on because too many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> people were getting my usernames wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And also the fact that I
didn't like my username- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What were they calling
you then? If it was wrong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, there was Anime guy, Anime dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not that hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's so true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like every time I hang
out, I was next to Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I swear he would get like
Anime man maybe only like 70% </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the time.
- Yeah, If that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's been so many
variations of your name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How that even hard to remember? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But there were people who
would like get my actual name </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wrong as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I've, I've been called John. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been called the one that
I couldn't fucking believe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember to this day was (mumbles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Some dude legit came up
to me and said, "Hey Josh" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - With like a hundred percent confidence. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - With hundred percent
confidence. And I was- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Man, respect to that guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I couldn't even be
like, it's Joey because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was actually just dumbfounded. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like you did not just
fucking call me that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you know like Josh? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you have a vendetta against Josh? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, nothing against Josh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've got mates called
Josh, but I'm not Josh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why did the name Josh specifically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> annoy you more than John? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's because
there's only ever been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that one guy who called me, Josh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Watch it now, next day, ex or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're gonna be Josh, the Anime guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I understand like Anime
guy or like Anime dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or like a different derivative
of the word man, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it's a pretty generic name, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Anime man, it's pretty fucking easy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I'd like to think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But actually like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think people have
gotten my internet handle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> wrong almost as much times as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they've got as they got it right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, probably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Because I think the
biggest thing is obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people think my name's GiggUK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. They're like, oh, I love you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love your word GiggUK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, how long
have you been watching my stuff? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think YouTube, should
implement those pronunciation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brackets that they have on
those like Merriam dictionary? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They like the Google
translate, like say the word- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is my name that hard to
pronounce because I swear I've had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so many mispronunciations of
my name and it doesn't even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> piss me off. I just find it funny, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't ever say anything.
I'm just like, whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - At least yours is
just a mispronunciation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Mine is literally just
not the correct word, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Josh
(Connor and Garnt giggling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's only so many
ways you could, like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know you could
pronounce man as dude or guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's just because my entire life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is a mispronunciation of my name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just fucking GiggUK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think the weirdest
mispronunciation of my real name </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually when I was in university. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I remember in university,
in Freshers week especially </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you meet a lot of new people
very quickly and obviously, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as you all know Garnt is
not a common name at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I've heard like every fucking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mispronunciations of my name by then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember my first day
of uni, I heard a new one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I go up to a person and
I say, "Hi, my name's Garnt" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thinking they'd say Grant, or Garnet or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of like, something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> That happens a lot. Garnet happens a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he goes "God, your name's God?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like what? How did you mishear that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, I almost said Grant, it's Garnt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's been confirmed, it's Garnet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause how I explain it, it's Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Think of Grants, but swap
the R and the A over. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. So that's how I like
speed run explaining my name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was just like, "Oh,
Garnt" and I'm thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my head, what a fucking damn ass, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how would you hear God from Garnt, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's just like the anomaly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's the glitch in the matrix. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then literally like two people later. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like introducing myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so like later in the day
I say, "Hi, my name's Garnt." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the second time,
"God, your name's God?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, what the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What is going on right now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it would be a
very bold move of a parent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to name their kid, God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So very bold name. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You gotta have high hopes to that kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I remember somehow in freshers week, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though I did introduce
myself to a lot of people within </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that short timeframe, probably
more than I have in my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in that like one week or two
period, three people thought my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> name was God when I first
introduced myself (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, why?
- It just like blew my mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just love it when people
just absolutely butcher my name </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in ways that I just wasn't expecting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that is like
my favorite thing ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Now that I am like this
public figure where even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my full name is public now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> There hasn't been a single
person who's pronounced my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> surname correct.
- Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the first time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bizinger
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's Bizinger, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like my favorite was
the FCCJ panel that we did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the guy called me something like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "And here at the end of the table, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is Joey the Anime Bizinger" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, first of
all, you forgot the man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Second of all, I did
an interview with you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You should be, you should be the Anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, the Anime, Joey the Anime (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Drop the man, drop
the guy, just the Anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I am Anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You are the Anime.
Not the man, the Anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think what I loved about
that live stream with FCCJ is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when he was introducing my name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember he like introduced you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He introduced Connor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, I think he got to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I could see the fucking
word processing in his mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there was like this brief
pause before he said my name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember like the chat
going, he's gonna say, Grant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> He's gonna mispronounce it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember, it was
just like a slight pause. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But that felt like an hour. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That felt like an entire death note scene. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That fucking pause, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You could've edited in like
the AOL loading sound like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - (mumbles) One second, three seconds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Has anyone ever mispronounced
CDawg or gotten your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> internet handle wrong? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, CDawg-
- Well, your surname </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is pretty difficult to pronounce. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, my surname, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I dunno- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also CDawg is very easy as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. CDawg, I'm
really glad I chose that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, we said this before, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Smart, It's an easy smart- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Unintentionally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I chose it to sound cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Doesn't actually sound that cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But now everyone just calls
me Connor I'd say that easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well that's what I like about
Trash Taste is that now we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just known as Joey, Garnt and Connor yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have a request to anyone
watching this who will meet us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in conventions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know Grant is a meme and
it doesn't piss me off when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people call me Grant but
please call me Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it will get to a point
where I literally will not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know if you just don't know who I am or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you are a Trash Taste viewer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So please, at least call me
Garnt the first time before you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> start memeing it up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Otherwise I will generally not know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> If you just are that deep
into the Trash Taste law, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or if you just generally
think my name's Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Genuinely won't be able to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Likewise with me, Josh is not my name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is
- It is now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] John is also not my name it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - (Connor mumbles indistinctly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you call him Josh, now
everyone's gonna know that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> watch this episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How come I'm not allowed to
get away with it, but you are, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Garnt's like, don't do this to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but do it to Joey, he'll be fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing)
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't do it to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't do the exact same thing
- As long as it's not to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bully Joey, just don't
bully me. I'm begging you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't believe it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So people just spell my
name incorrectly that's all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They don't say it wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I mean, there's only so many ways </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you can fucking pronounce Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Oh, it's all 'con air' maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] 'con air'. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'con-air' </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] 'con air'. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's a movie-
- My favorite movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I think that's in a movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Great movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My favorite Nicholas Cage movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's an honor to be
confused with "Con Air" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fantastic.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That sounds like the cursive Conner </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Conner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just like if Sebastian
pronounces could be as Conner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughing)
- Maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what you should be like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If someone at a convention
stops you being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey Sebastian" they should
be like, "It's Con Air" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never saw in my
life until like I got on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the internet that you could
spell Connor with an E-R. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Conner. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Conner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - C-O-N-N-E-R </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never saw that but a
friend of my school who was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> called Connah, but it
was spelled C-O-N-N-A-H. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Connah
- Connah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Connah
- Connah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There-
- What's the Australian- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause there was also a place near me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was called Connor something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But lemme spell that one- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is like a very phonetic
Connor isn't it Connah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Connah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's Connah Mate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Connah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I was like, am I the weird? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> No, I've got the normal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have the normal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yours is the normal one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have the normal
Connor, I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I am the real one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> This is all a joke. You're all lying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> None of you are the real Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who's the person who had the
weirdest name that you knew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> personally in your life? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you judge as weird?
- Okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like obscure or just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> why would you choose that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, for me I knew a guy
in my school whose first name, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whose real name was Gameron </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Gameron
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Not Cameron, Gameron with a G. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I kind of like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That sounds cool.
- I thought was fucking cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That sounds cool.
- But it's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in my head, I was like, first of all, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where does that come from? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And second of all was like
their parents' handwriting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so shit at the birth certificate
that the doctor was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, that's an interesting,
way to spell Cameron." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was a kid from another school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I always was so jealous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They'd called that kid, Zeus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Zeus?
- That was his first name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck you, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was like-
- God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, again, the
fun with really badass names </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is that if you don't
live up to a badass name, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it looks pathetic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like imagine like you're like
a kind of super shy person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah
- Yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're like, what's your name? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, it's Zeus" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you need to be larger than life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're called Zeus, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like in school when
you had that one surname, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I knew a guy whose surname was Champion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And unfortunately-
- Was he a champion? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Unfortunately no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He didn't quite live up to his surname. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was a surname though.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause if it was your first
name everyone's calling you... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, right. Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The parents must have been confident. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They'd be like, you better
live up to this name </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or you're a failure.
- You are a literal champion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They must have gone to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the sperm bank got the
highest grade sperm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like nine foot guy,
went to Harvard, 10,000 IQ. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like this guy's
a Zeus from a 100%. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it actually spelled like the god? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah.
- Exact same way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God, that's so badass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I remember 'cause I
threw javelin against him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I beat him and I was
like, I beat the Zeus javelin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] That's so ironic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, this is amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, this is great. I beat Zeus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> At the time I didn't care though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But now I'm like, I beat Zeus at javelin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not a big deal.
- No biggie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not a big deal, but it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, one of my mates who
used to live here in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Australian guy, his real
full name was Storm Angus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is the most Australian
name I've ever heard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is the most badass... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> When he introduced himself as that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, no, you're not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's just an
Australian superhero name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Look it's Storm Angus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, yeah- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey shrieking) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sounds like a superhero </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - He just shoots down
lightning (shrieking) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He just throws down
like fosters or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> ( Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, my God.
- Love you Storm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's why I want go to Australia, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never been to Australia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just really want to go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sounds like a laugh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah,
- It's all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Australia's that one
place where you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't believe people like this exist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like unironically, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've always wondered what are
Australian conventions like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. I mean there isn't really a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been to two different ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There is Supernova which
is more like a Comic Con. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then there is SMASH,
which is the big Anime Con </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in Sydney.
- Right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The SMASH stand for anything? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. The Sydney Manga Anime Show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Good name.
- Okay, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So the first time I
went was in like 2013, '14 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there was maybe like
3000 people, 4,000 people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was tiny convention. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But the year that I went
before the pandemic where I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a guest at there was like
almost like 30, 40,000 people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's like clearly grown massively. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I honestly think like in
terms of like the actual, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like vibe of the Con and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't really see it as that
much different to like a U.S </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Con or any other like
English-speaking convention, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's like everyone-
- Can speak- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I actually can't spell the word- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not actual cuts, but yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So we're not throwing Cons.
- But like Australian Cons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Obviously I felt a little
more at home because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was talking to people
with the same accent as me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because like that was like
my first Con ever, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like my home tuff, but yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In terms of like a Con experience, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't really see it as that
much more different to like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> standard American Con I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel just like weebs in general </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like Anime fans in general, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they kind of all give
off like the same vibe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> A lot of them are just kind of
like chill and down to earth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just wanna like chat with you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like in Australia, a
lot like America where is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of stranger friendliness
is still pretty prevalent, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So a lot of people didn't
really have problems, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> coming up to me and talking
to me and stuff like that just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as like, Hey, Joey what's up man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean you guys will definitely
have a fucking great time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if we ever end up going to SMASH </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or an Australian convention, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every now and then you
will meet those like very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stereotypical, loud Aussies who, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (mumbles indistinctly) that level, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But-
- That sounds good to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds like a laugh.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel though, those kinds of people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you wouldn't really find in
a lot of like Anime Cons, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll see them at the pub. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you know, very rarely
have I seen an Anime fan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Those conventions you
love going to the pub after, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's close by you just see like Curito </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> downing like a Stellar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like what's going on?
I don't remember this part. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, you know, chicken,
like in an Alcohol Cosplay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like doing a shoey it's like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You like to drink with us (mumbles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I unfortunately didn't
see that, I wish I did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do a lot of people get
drunk at Aussie conventions? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause that's the big thing
about British conventions, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way more than like-
- So much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It is like-
- all they do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's more than the
actual convention itself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just people are just
like, oh, there's Anime here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Cool, Let's get a fucking pint. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's hard to say at least in Sydney, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think it's would be
as much as in the UK just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because like drinking or
eating out in Sydney is really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking expensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like a pint of beer is
like fucking $10 Australian </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like a lot of like
places in Sydney, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like in the city. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 10 Aussie dollars or-
- 10 Real dollars, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> $10 is real currency show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - $10 Reduced. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I think to like a lot
of kids who come to these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> conventions like $10 is a lot of money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That's $10 you could spend
on Anime Merge at the Con. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I didn't see as many
drunk people as I thought there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was gonna be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But a lot of the parents were
getting drunk that's for sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They were like they've had a hard day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They probably drove like
an hour to get into the city </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like hey kids have fun
at your Japanese convention. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Daddy and I are gonna go over to the pub </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and get shitfaced while we wait for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like-
- I've taken care of the kids. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so like in between
like signings and stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd take a step outside and
you look over at the terrace </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of some of these like pubs,
on the water and there's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of parents clearly just
like waiting for their kids, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just being like (mumbles) yeah? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't blame them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly. I'd probably do
the same when I have kids, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I'm like an only child, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I never had this experience, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I remember like Sydney
talking about it all the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where your parents would
just take you to events </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you would just
give all the responsibility </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the older sibling to take
care of the younger siblings. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And just like, here's a
bunch of money fuck off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
Have fun, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I definitely have that. That's for sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe I can't remember really
maybe I was a little shy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I've very rarely
had experiences like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I think like me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and my sister didn't really
like share a lot of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the same like interests
when we were growing up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel as adults now, we are
like starting to like share </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> more of like the same likes on things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really like remember going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to a lot of events with my sister. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe we went to like a
few concerts, but that's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did your parents ever take
you to an event that you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't wanna fucking go to? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But you had to go to 'cause
your parents were going to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Football matches. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Football matches (giggles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My dad used to drag
me to football matches. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's gonna love this bit now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like, "I didn't drag
you, you wanted to go?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, he would bribe me with chocolate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> He would be like, I'll
buy you like a Galaxy bar, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like this chocolate in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not like the small bars.
- Yeah (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like this sized block one,
it's like, we got some serious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chocolate Malach here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like I'll buy it for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the worst part my
dad would laugh at this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> When I was like eight, he would
take me to like pub before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where it was literally
like a football club, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- So it's cheap. It's dirty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's absolutely rammed. It stinks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like everyone is eating
like pork scratchings and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> downing like really cheap pints. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah -
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually remember just
sitting there just like not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> understanding anything although
that they would just ask me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes stuff about football
and I'd be like, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Wayne Rooney. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just remember I never
understood anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And one time I went
to a match and Everton, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my dad's obsessed with like
Everton family and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember they'd
won because I was there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and my dad was like convinced </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I was the good luck charm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I got dragged to more,
I told him, I hate it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I do not want to go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I absolutely despise this
'cause I would just stand there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember it was
cold and it was so loud </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just wanted to play my Game Boy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I had to watch these people kick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, why is it 90 minutes long? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's so long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughing)
- So yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To a child, 90 minutes is long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. And I would always be
like, can I get some like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I don't know why as
a kid, I just wanted to eat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just wanted to eat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And they would sell those
like stupidly long hot dogs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at these football events. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember one time I had
one and my dad let me like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like hold onto it for
like two seconds and someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bumped into me and I dropped it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I was so mortified. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember, I think
that ruined football for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, no, I'm done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't even eat a hotdog in peace </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This guy didn't even buy me a new one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He like knocked me over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I was like eight, I
dunno how to articulate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> All I remember was I was just
really sad that I dropped this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hot dog.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you couldn't buy a new one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So my dad had just given me
like enough money to buy it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was like he'd like, let me have it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then all the other food
was like steak kidney pies from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this thing called Pukka Pies in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That's was so bad, really bad. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember I sorta liked it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but just remember being like
totally confused and not really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> understanding it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I never really liked football. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- My brothers did though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They liked going. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And my older brother liked it a lot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I just never liked it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I felt like I was a failure to my dad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause he was like, I just
want you to like sports. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why can't you like sports? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like be a normal person and like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Football </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like the only kid in the
UK that didn't like football. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember 'cause my parents
were like really into like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> looking at property, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like what?
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And for the longest time I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> are we gonna move house? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would get excited </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, no, we're just looking? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was like, we're
literally window shopping houses. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like two to like a 10 year old. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like the most non privileged
thing I've ever heard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, because my dad
is heavily into stocks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and investing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's investment.
- He's an investor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm watching a home in the sun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's for investment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
He was an investor, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And also like my parents
used to go a lot as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so that they could get inspirations
for like interior design </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff like that because
my dad loved doing renovations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> into the house and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So he would get a lot of like
good ideas from that, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] That makes more sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. But to a 10 year old, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what the fuck
like all that shit is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You would think if your parents
came up to you and said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Son, we're gonna go check
out some houses today." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The first thing you would
think of as a 10 year old is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yay, we're moving. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And my sister who's three
years younger than me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like we're moving houses,
that's so exciting, yay! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So really for the first couple of times, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we'd go along with them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Until we realized, we're not moving, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - we're just looking at houses
- Just looking at them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have a question,
actually, this just came out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't answer it Garnt unfortunately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's about brothers and sisters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So obviously let's
say there's two siblings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or three siblings in my house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How was it decided, who gets
which bedroom in your house? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a good question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Well.
- Did you ever ask. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Mad Royale Squid Game" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I am the middle son. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I got the tiniest room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ah, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, I think for us, we
got lucky because the house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I grew up in or I was
born in was like bought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just at the same time
as they got that house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I basically got first dips. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because my sister wasn't born yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, so you got to choose? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wasn't like a three
year old being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Father, this room is a little
larger than the other one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, you know, what's funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's exactly what my
parents fucking did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They asked me when I
was like two or whatever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which room I wanted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gosh, when you were two, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know at an age </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I cannot comprehend what I am doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a big space either way for a kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I'm like, this is fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I literally chose like
the Harry Potter closet and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like Mom don't fucking
believe what two or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> three-year old Connor choose. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why would you do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mom comes out with a
contractor. Is this you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this your name? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've got the receipt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you sign this?
- You signed by blood. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you sign this? I'm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, what the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I would never choose it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, I would've never chosen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got the room, which was
right next to my parents' room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because obviously I
was the firstborn child </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then my sister, got the lost room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which just so happened
to be next to the toilet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember she would complain
because I think our rooms </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> were pretty much the same size. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it might have been minor differences, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it didn't really matter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was roughly the same size. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I remember my sister
used to complain being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at least you're not fucking
in a room where every time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> someone wanna take a shit
in the middle of the night, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get woken up by it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that sounds like you problem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But also you're closest to the toilet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's that's what I said. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's an advantage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That's a perk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm wondering comments. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If you have brothers and
sisters or what, whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> how was it decided which
room was given to who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can't relate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - or you were all shoved into one room? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can't relate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well actually, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When we were really
little, my sister and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously just slept in the
same room, in the same bed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it was probably
maybe when I was six or seven </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that I finally got to
pick one of the rooms, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't remember there being
like a ritualistic "Squid Game" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like, well now fight to the death. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was just, apparently I
chose this room, which is- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You remember choosing the room? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, of course not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't. I remember I'd
asked my parents later on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, well, I chose it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, why would you listen to me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why? I am not in the right mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I cannot make good decisions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was probably massive
to you when you chose it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was tiny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> There was no place to put
more than like a single bed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not that I would ever need
more than a single bed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like even if I wanted bigger, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was actually no
space to put it anywhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And so it was just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course you talking about that, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you obviously remember
it different to your parents. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I guarantee your parents are
gonna remember it and recall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all are differently being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, I specifically remember Connor fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> volunteering his tribute. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yes, I will take the
smallest room for the family. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Going back to like
weird events your parents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are taking you to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The thing that sticks out
to my mind right now is my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> parents or my Mom once took
me to a meditation meetup. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it was a meditation meetup. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So my Mom's like Buddhist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This was before I became
like a monk or a kid monk or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes you pray or you
meditate for good karma </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and all that stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So sometimes when Mom
would go to like these, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Buddhist meetups or these
meditation meets up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What you do at this meetup is
you go there and you meditate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for about an hour in like darkness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With a bunch of other people or like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - With a bunch of other people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was about seven years
old when this happened. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think like at time there
was no one to take care </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at home or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But my Mom's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Garnt you're coming with
me, we're gonna meditate" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember her framing it in
a way where we're just gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> meditate for a little
bit, like five minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what it was in my head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't know how long, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I would be sitting still
for at this meet up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She taught me how to
meditate and we'd do it for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 10 to like 15 minutes at most. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what I thought I was
getting into. So we get there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember the head guy was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, thank you all for coming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we're gonna be sitting here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna hit the gong and
we're gonna turn off lights </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we're gonna just sit here for an hour. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And after the hours on, I'm
gonna hit the gong again." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Squid Game" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> After you turn the lights off,
half people are dead there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so I remember
thinking, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've got to sit here
in silence for an hour. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> What? I was seven years old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't like sit still for
five minutes let alone a hour. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like solving the God equation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I remember sitting down,
I'm like fucking panicking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Trying to figure out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> How the fuck I am going
to sit here for an hour. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I look over to my Mom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My Mom's just like already
like in the zone. - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - She's already gone
- She's long gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - She's in another fucking
dimension right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so he hits the gong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Luckily they have a clock in
the room so you can see how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much time goes past. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Now what you're meant to do
during meditation is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you are meant to just
clear your mind, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The point of an hour is that
it shouldn't feel like an hour </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because to your minds, it
should be as empty as possible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you shouldn't really feel
the passage of time or you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> should feel it less than usual. Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the entire like "zone" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're supposed to get with meditation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I remember thinking, all
right Garnt, you got this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've meditated for 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can do an hour. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember sitting there and to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think about 40 minutes has past, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let me sneak over at the clock. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I look over five minutes has gone by. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, oh, I
start fucking sweating. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I look around- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How are you seeing the
clock in the dark? - Huh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like one of the
glow in the dark - Oh, Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - With like luminescence. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That makes it even harder
not to look as a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna look at the glow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I come up with
this five head strategy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because at that point I
was obsessed with "Pokemon" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who wasn't?
- Yeah. Who wasn't? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember like back in the
day I had like recorded like an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> entire season of Pokemon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that was like my only entertainment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I had like watched this VHS </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on this recording of "Pokemon"
like fucking 10, 20 times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like you should </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So I think to myself, how am I
going to get through an hour? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I got a five head idea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What if I just watched three
episodes of Pokemon in my mind? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if I watched three episodes
of Pokemon in my mind an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hour went up fast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I remember this- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This fucking serially experiments lane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I like escape. It's
either casual in my mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is this the metaverse? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like entered the metaverse in my mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I just start watching,
I just start playing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the episodes of Pokemon
that I can remember. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Unfortunately, I think
some gaps were missed off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I remember like
watching in my mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Three episodes looking at the clock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and half an hour had gone by. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe time moves differently in my mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt got a gold sprint
on for watching "Pokemon" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I think I watched an
entire season of "Pokemon" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your mind was just like, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cutting out all the filler right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Only the important information. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I got through
an entire fucking season. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I finally hear the
gong and I'm like thank fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember afterwards
some of my Mom's friends comes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over to her and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like so impressed with your son. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, how do you sit there for an hour? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like my son can't concentrate
anything for five minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm so impressed with your son. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, they dunno. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I just watched "Pokemon" one for an hour. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Meanwhile you are drenching in sweat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What does Ash say again in this episode, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, Ash was about to get
into the indigo league. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> At least you stopped at a
fucking good point, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - How the fuck did you
do that? That's insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This man literally opened
up his third eye by reciting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Pokemon" in his head. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anime companies hate this one
trick to letting you rewatch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the Anime in your mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You wanna recite "Pokemon"? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the real secret to
like reaching in Lightman. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't empty your mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You just watch one piece in
your mind and you just reach </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enlightenment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Could you do that now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I could not do that now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I could watch a show and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> couldn't do that immediately after. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because that was back in
the day when you were a kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you had like that one thing
that you watched overnight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You could just like recite it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember I could probably
like recite the entire movie of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Toy Story" or something in my mind, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just because like I
watched it so many times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Damn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There are some movies like that too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I could probably recite the
entirety of "Pulp Fiction" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's 'cause I've seen it so
many fucking times right now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> three and a half hour movie, let's go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What you need to better
meditate for that long? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, when I need to meditate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] So what again? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So what again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dare you, I double
dare you motherfucker? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what they call quarter pounder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with cheese in France? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But Connor did you
never have that as a kid? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like some, a game or
something that you played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so many times that you could
just like recite it for memory? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No
- Never. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not recite here. I'd
probably played SAFA Bunch, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but never seen I had
to recite from memory. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But are you the kind
of person who remembers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> song lyrics easily? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not, not at all.
- [Joey] Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I actually cannot remember
song lyrics without looking at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the sheet.
- [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And even then it's like,
it'll last like a day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because it's really interesting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's two types of
people where there's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's ones who are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can listen to a song
once and you just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> miraculously just remember
how the lyrics go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then there are
people who are just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could listen to this song
50 times and it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll recognize the lyrics
if someone tells me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but I can't recite.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So I had this realization
the other day because I've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously given Connor
a lot of shit for like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hearing the beeps and the boops. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then I just had this
realization that I think I listen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to music like beeps and
beeps as well, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Lyrics mean nothing to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so weird.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where I listen to a song
and if lyrics aren't there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like something's missing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I do think lyrics
need is a part of the song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But to me, lyrics are almost
like another instrument to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so weird.
- [Joey] Oh, yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where I don't listen
to what they're saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You can take a song that I
love and you lay the lyrics out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in front of me and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never heard this song in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing)
What is the song? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well I would argue that best
artists and the best singers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the best bands, as you
said, use their voice as an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> instrument. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then if you want to
read into the lyrics, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the lyrics are also profound. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where unfortunately, very
few artists can do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where it's either you concentrate fully on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the lyrics to be like, here's
a deep, poetic meaning behind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I'm understanding this, you're saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the voice is a part of the song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that what you're saying?
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Well, yeah, no shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But there are a lot of
artists who don't see it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that way and it also depends
on how the song's mixed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But like some artists you
hear and it's just like, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wish I could hear the
instruments because it's just being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drowned out by the singing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you ever properly
listened to the lyrics of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a song and it's changed the
way you think about a song </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because you properly
actually read into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah like the new Weekend
album's really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But if you just actually
listen to what he's saying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's depressing as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So that rarely ever- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're like vibing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, dude, this song is so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ♪ I'm fucking depressed ♪ </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and shit is going wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, yeah, fuck this is so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Wait, what'd you say? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You like listening and
it's like, wait, hold on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. He de... what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I can't even get to that moment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it's really weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But like sometimes if there's
like a disconnect between how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the song makes me feel versus
what the lyrics are saying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I always like go towards
what the song makes me feel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's so weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because I dunno how much
of this is bullshit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Welcome to the beeps and boops day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. That's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hear the beeps and the boops. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The beeps and the boobs
make me feel something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's what I feel towards
a song that I hardly ever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> listen to lyrics at all, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because it never changes
how I feel towards the song. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You guys are literally that
type of people who would make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a fucking art Buzzfeed article
being like top 10 songs that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have a dark meaning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] We're engineers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And be like, did you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hear the fucking music it
comes in and it just comes in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like a fucking graph in my head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It comes in like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] The thing is, I get
that. I totally get that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I feel it I do
have emotions towards it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. Of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I don't give a shit
what he's talking about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just in taking the noise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And the noise either makes me
feel something or it doesn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is why I think for a lot
of songs where there is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a stark contrast between how
the song makes you feel versus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how the lyrics make you feel.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is like a big whiplash
for people like you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, what the fuck?.
- Preface live. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It is different though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Definitely there's a lot more
to it when its a recorded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> album.
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like that's why I
find it so easy to listen to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of Japanese music
or a lot of like music in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a language that I don't understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I have no idea what
the lyrics they are spitting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most of the time, but you
know, part of me is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel the emotions hard.
- But this goes had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel the emotion that
they're singing right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh yeah. Definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I kind get it, even though
I probably don't get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can tell you I take
90% of Anime openings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> The lyrics are depressing as fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But just weaves that are
kind of like (mumbles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which I find it's cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what I find really
interesting though about people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who can do that
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the reason why I
feel that in and of itself, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that discovery of when people
find out this really bright </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and colorful and very
positive sounding song </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually has a really
fucking dark meaning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's that realization
of like, oh, shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just got played because I
wasn't listening to the lyrics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why 'cause we like
had this idea to do a music </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> three by three, for like ages
and I've like low key actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been shitting myself at the-
- [Joey] Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because one of the mediums </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I find hardest to fucking explain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is music
- Is music </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I literally hear this song- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] This sounds good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This song made me feel things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just really like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And people are like oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> did you know the meaning of that song? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have no idea of the
meaning of that song. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it made me feel things.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It make me feel things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] I get that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Welcome to the beeps and
the boops ladies and gentlemen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought you were in my team. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel betrayed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Welcome to the beeps and boops. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel absolutely betrayed goddamnit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The music episode would be
Joey talking with you out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then me and Garnt
go, I like this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That why I almost don't want to do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I think I'd
rather just make a video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You carry the episode.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which might be the shortest Trash Taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> episode of all time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like 40 minutes in and
we're like, and that's it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. All right. Thanks
for joining Trash Taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you have an example
of like a song where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you found more like
reading into the lyrics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the deeper meaning of
that song, as opposed to just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> listening to the initial
beats, the beeps and boops. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll go into like-
- Pink Floyd, The wall. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, yes, that too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think there's a lot of like
artists that, you know... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's that brilliance of using
the lead singer as just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> an instrument it where it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're not listening to the
lyrics or anything like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it still sounds great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's still like sticky in your head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But then one day you're like,
I've listened to this song </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like three or four times, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I've never actually read the lyrics, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let me read into the lyrics
and then you read into it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and a lot of it's very
like poetic and you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> completely changes the
way you view that song. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like Turning Japanese, you know that song? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah
- No </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ♪Turning Japanese ♪ </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> ♪I think I'm turning... ♪ </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (mimicking the song beat) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't know that song? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah, I know that song. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That song's about masturbation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But no one knows it because
no one reads into the lyrics. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> They just hear the
(mimicking the song beat) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, oh yeah, love that song. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that what Turning Japanese is about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- It's about masturbation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never heard of this song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well like how Pumped Up
Kicks is about school shootings </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] I know that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like when people first
discovered that they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my God, I've been fucking gebaited. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's catchy as shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's catchy as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a jam of a song </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I find that to be like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> As someone who also writes
music that is so much fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> harder than it looks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. No, I can imagine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel bad that I don't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or I have the inability to
appreciate it because like, but- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I feel that's fine because, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel with those kinds of songs
they're taking into account </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how it sounds first, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they think about
the meaning afterwards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the only exception
is with rap music, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it is just like
basically just lyrical poems </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to a beat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So that's where I actually have
more of an understanding or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like an image in my head of, oh man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> these lyrics go fucking hard so- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do listen to the lyrics
of rap, try to, at least. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's hard though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like most of the times
I actually see the lyrics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sheets and it almost
transforms it that to a point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I don't even
recognize the song anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was always like separate
from the song itself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If someone can explain this to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm super curious because I
am incapable of like getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the meaning of lyrics as
I'm listening to the song </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the same time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You recognize it has anything
to do with the fact that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm the only musical trained
one outta the three of us? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, probably pretty appreciate it more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah,
- Maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - To me it's all noise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like it.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it's noise. - I can
play musical instruments, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I've never been like
professionally trained. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's just what it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel it's just because
you've been trained to listen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to music in a different way.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That you can just perceive
these smaller points that other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people would just perceive as
just the beeps and the boops. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, to me, like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like people who go to
a gallery and look at art. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A lot of them have just been
trained to look at this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a completely different way
that you otherwise would've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a very hard time grasping. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You go to an art gallery with
an art critic and they'd be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like, yes, I love the flow and
the texture and the feelings </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that I get from it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's making me feel this way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And the average person
looking it be like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like the color red as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's just based
on how you are trained. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can play musical
instruments and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I've never like
studied music theory or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So when I like wrote songs
before it was more like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (mumbles) sound nice
or something like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Chord sound nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was just like my process. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey indistinctly speaking) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Musically trained. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, musically trained. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Goddamn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But yeah, at this rate,
I don't know if we'll ever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> actually end up doing
a music three by three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm down. I just gotta
think of nine albums </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like right now- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are we doing albums or
artists? That's the question. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - we should do artists. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Artists, okay- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think of 4, 5 that I feel
like I could strongly say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I've listened to everything.
I like everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A lot of others I'm like
I like this one album. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Arctic Monkeys, I like
a lot, but not every album. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You wanna be experimental to your thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I don't know how I
can sit there and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is one of my favorite
artists, by the way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this one album's shit I don't like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I think that's a valid- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of my favorite artists
have a shit album or two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, I dunno if I'm a
anomaly in this as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I don't normally listen
to albums as a whole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You just listen to a song </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's very normal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like shitting myself,
thinking of nine albums. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I'm like, how many four
albums have I listened to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] I mean it's just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We'll do it eventually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. We'll do it eventually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I gotta figure out how to
like talk about music first. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You guys deal with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then when you guys are ready, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come back and then we can do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like he was trying to
say something with this song. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I could feel it. I don't
know what it was exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I feel like-
- I like these words. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In the song he said he
felt it coming many times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I believe he did feel it coming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I was definitely coming as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> My God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But anyway, that's been this
