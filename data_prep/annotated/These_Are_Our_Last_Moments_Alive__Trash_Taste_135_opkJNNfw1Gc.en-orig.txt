<SPEAKER_04> hello and welcome to this episode of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trash taste I'm your host for today gone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and once again joining me are the boys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is pink a manly color I guess we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> starting on that [ __ ] topic uh why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why why why is this the chance this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the eye generated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yes is the answer yes hello hello AI </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> generation yes answer and I will tell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you exactly why that is I'm Googling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> best podcast topics right now let's see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what comes up best podcast topics we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> should we should do we we should do an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> episode where it's completely AI </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> generated actually because I was I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> actually having a play with a chat GPT </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the other day yeah uh which is like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> newest kind of like AI opens I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know if it's open source but it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> available to the public right yeah um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's basically by open AI which is a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> company that was founded by Elon Musk so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the real-life Batman villain Elon Musk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it is scarily good it was it is actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of terrifying and well you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I when you say that I think back to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it and I think about all the videos I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watched where a Skyrim NPC Behavior I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think are we really that hard to emulate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think we're that hard to emulate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're pretty [ __ ] yourself it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> high IQ person yeah life is I I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like as a record is it hard to seem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> somewhat human if you you know feed it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enough books and [ __ ] well well I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't that the whole point of like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> touring test yeah yeah like well I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're all like also by the way I would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like to talk about kids programming as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> well I completely unrelated to my Google </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> search wait what that was one of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> recommended topics for a podcast kids </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> programming kids programs obviously the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> absolute State the absolute [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> state of kids programs please indulge Us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in what I'm sorry the state of kids I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't watch YouTube kids actually thank </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you very much I get pissed off on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTube and it tells me as a kid so I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like this is clearly not for kids </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> myself hold on pause was that really the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> top oh that was one of them yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's what they recommended talking no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I I know the top podcaster q a is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fortnite actually overrated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> topic ideas uh uh q a so we should do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that questions and answers ask me a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> question yeah okay I'll ask you a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> question sure our entire podcast is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> question okay isn't that paranormal do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have good questions no we've done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we've done paranormal we've done </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> paranormal True Crime we spoke about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that yeah personal finance I'm not good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> at it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what a riveting topic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we should do this one guided meditations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think we should do that what do you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean like we should guide the viewers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how to meditate do you meditate [ __ ] no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't have to be a a singer to judge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> singing right I was probably the only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> person here that has actually meditated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's not that hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> kids programming time specific and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> finally event planning event planning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> event planning that sounds like a job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> event planning guys I love I heck in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> love planning events I just I just want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to plan events like birthday parties I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like that list was held together by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone who's never done or watched a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> podcast again so that was probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> written by a human being it was probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> written by Ai and like the AI would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> probably make more interesting AI topics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> right probably yeah so is it really that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hard to emulate human beings I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> know I guess we'll test it out future </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I guess we'll test out on a future </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> episode but no like I was playing around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with chat GPT yeah um and like I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the people I you know because our entire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] uh lives are now run by AI </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> simply because I you know started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looking into chap gbt now my entire </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recommended on YouTube is all cha GPT </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just because that's what YouTube thinks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that our AI is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and it's actually like terrifying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think program is right now software </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Engineers like the amount like charge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> EPT as a resource not just like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's kind of like an all-encompassing a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> AI you can ask it like scarily uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scarily like human questions and it will </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like literally type out an entire essay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it can do your homework for you yeah if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you are if you if you type out like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the right prompts and everything like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I tested it out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I I typed in Tyler can you write a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gig Up Style review of Full Metal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Alchemist right and uh that that is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is around 10 minutes long right right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and at first the first iteration it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> types it out and it's like a kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like generic review and then I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh try adding like a few jokes here and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there try referring to this try </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> referring to that it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually [ __ ] freaked me out right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it started adding jokes you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like if you're familiar with my content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes I do like little skits where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like some guy shouts in the background </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that chargpt added that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to the script I was like what the actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] this is my my job is done my job is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually done like it's this if if an AI </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> can like take my style of videos and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> emulate it in the most basic sense now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's it gonna be like [ __ ] five ten </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> years in the future I uh yeah because I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I also I also did the same thing I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the video should be out by it now but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like I decided to do a [ __ ] post video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on my second Channel where I did a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chainsaw man anime review but the entire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> script is written by AI yeah but like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't use the one you used I used a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> couple of the other like kind of free to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> use um opens I guess they're open source </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the amount of stuff I've seen online I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like this this gotta be free yeah a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of them though you have to pay like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a monthly subscription to use like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> limit what the [ __ ] using AI that much I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know but like the ones that I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> chose uh to use while like kind of made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the first like you know a couple of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thousand words were like yeah uses like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a test kind of thing and then if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> wanted to use like unlimited words for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> however long it's like five dollars a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> month or something like that and I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like first of all I'm not paying for a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> subscription service for an AI like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that so I just like use the limit for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the free to use to just be like uh just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah all I did was just like chainsaw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man anime review yeah and then put in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> couple of like character things and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah they clearly didn't know what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> chainsaw man was I thought it was a man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who was a change yeah because because he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tried to write like a like a synopsis </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for it and it was like uh Jeff is a man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who owns a chainsaw shop uh and he comes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> home one day to kill his wife and he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> becomes the chainsaw man but I just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> become okay but I just but I was like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> thought that was really funny so I just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> completely left it as in and then I just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> read the script verbatim yeah in like my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> style </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um I don't know how it's turned out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it hasn't come out as this video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comes out but it was really funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like man I thought I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> contrarian and on anime yeah this AI had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no chill it was just like it was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yes uh the animation was a kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> subpar but the fighting scenes were kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of good but overall the story was very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> forgettable when Bland I was like damn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> hey I chill oh my God you should give </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Chad GPT a try because it's it's got it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it like writes things to a point where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you could literally take this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um like if we had Chad gbt when I was in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> high school I was never doing any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] hurt I would not be doing any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] homework it's yeah it literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> gets to a point where you could ask it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to write you know you could literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> say write a python script that does this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this and like it understands what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your request is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> entire codes that's scary of like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know like C plus plus programming python </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever the [ __ ] you want or you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ask it to write you a video script about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> X or Y yeah yeah you can like ask it to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> iterate upon itself to be like okay take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this script and add a little bit of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> humor add a little bit of this maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> expand on this section and it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] it's it's an amazing amazing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> resources a resource but at the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> time it's [ __ ] terrifying teachers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and professors must be [ __ ] sweating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> now because you remember like I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] sweating because because like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> remember like when we were in college </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like high school and stuff like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot like the biggest thing we had to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> worry about was like don't take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> citations from Wikipedia yeah like but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now it's just like don't get a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> super you know like hard-working AI to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically do your workflow because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> how do you there must be measures </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> nowadays right because like this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is so openly available to like students </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now and it's like a lot more well known </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's probably only going to be all well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> known from here on out it's like how are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they going to figure out a way to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> make sure you're not just using this AI </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right like they they probably have to I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got it I got it right you build an AI to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> detect the AI </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the only way I can like imagine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> currently how they do it yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> folks that's how they distinguished </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we use the AI to kill the AI </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just it's just modern day weapons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah when you make a when you make a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> tank that can withstand bullets then you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> add Rockets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we're gonna make us stronger it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always going to be this cat of mouse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game holy [ __ ] which one is funny yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but but like what's what's incredible to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me is like you know when in school we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> learn about like you know history and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know the Industrial Revolution </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and how all like the workers kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like revolted and like protested when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know they were getting replaced by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> machines yeah and you know you you sit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there as a kid being like ah dumb </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> history that'll never happen and we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> literally like seeing it happen right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] now yeah it's actually insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well the more that we become like NPCs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the more the NPCs become like humans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right have you not noticed the explosion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of MPC humor online have you noticed I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have noticed that yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've not noticed an explosion of NPC </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> humor it's something that's just existed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> since it's show big history online </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Skyrim right yeah surely but it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> more so like people behaving like NPCs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like Tick Tock just made it like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> explode because it's so much so easy to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get like it's just America right well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah pretty much all of America right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that's just clearly right we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> generalizing the entire America right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's how it is yeah we can go back to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's interesting it's interesting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's that whole thing of like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we live in a simulation meme just kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of coming back right yeah I've seen the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> simulation is failing right now yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've seen I've seen so many memes like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just like on Meme pages and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Tick Tock and stuff like that of like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we I was like no we don't live in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> simulation and it's like oh really have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you ever seen your neighbor bring in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> groceries and it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're just like coming back from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like these like meme channels it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty good it's pretty good it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> really good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that's just the next level of hits blunt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> meme </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you've seen my neighbors bring in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> groceries right you know I don't think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like when do they do it maybe I'm I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the neighbor okay yeah it just spawns in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> their fridge obviously well to be fair I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> don't bring the [ __ ] groceries back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I just ubereats all the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that might be another big reason as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just love it it's so funny yeah but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's weird because I think a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> people thought that the last job that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would be taken over is kind of like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> creative job right we all thought we We </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All Fall there you know there'd be a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> point where computers can get smart to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do a lot of like the specialist jobs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we have to study for and stuff like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that but creative jobs art music that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can never be replicated and it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> weird seeing the kind of like the AI art </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of like well we're going are we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going down that rabbit hole like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> controversy yeah it happened within the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> last last few months if anything I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of things are automated now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> physically but obviously I mean think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> about it like still you have to build a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] robot yeah you have to build </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something and test it but when you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just run code over and over again and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> keep tweaking it and keep running it on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these super computers it doesn't require </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you to build anything it's like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well yeah it makes way more sense that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this stuff could be replicated and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something especially like music is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> anyone really surprised that AI was able </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to replicate music like when you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about it it's it's not that complicated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this is coming from the guy who doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> make music by the way on the beeps and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> boops to me to me it's not that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> complicated oh my gosh now I know now I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know how the like artists feel when the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> AI odd came out I am yeah I'm offended </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what am I saying okay listen listen that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is okay that is a general sweeping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> segment am I saying that AI music is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sounds indistinguishable no no make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that sounds pretty much like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> normal music or very passable music yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of course nothing like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Symphony that sounds amazing no of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> course yeah you might I don't know and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know what I mean like is anyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really surprised that given the tools </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we had to make music digitally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anyway that right would be able to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> figure out oh hey if we just feed it a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] ton of information this is what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> music looks like to a robot this is what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it sounds like hey give it a shot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> course it's gonna be like this yeah but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the thing right and I feel that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a a can of worms that like a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people try and you know Skip around the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> conversation with of like that you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like when that whole uh AI art </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like uh programming came out you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's been coming out for a while but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like about a month or so ago like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know there was that one AI art program </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that like everyone on Twitter was using </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was like oh this is really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] cool to pay money for as well to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] scam right but it's like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know I you know I I did it because I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> did it for a video because I thought you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know oh what kind of [ __ ] up Creations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can this AI make of me right and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know it was funny and you know for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> entertaining purposes but then obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got a lot of like backlash from like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know the art community Unity of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like oh so you're not going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> commission real artists but then you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to get art from Air that steals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other artists work and I'm just like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hate that argument because it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> other like human artists steal from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> other human artists as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's a tough conversation to have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right because it's that's a fact that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people don't want to admit no I I it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's it's it's a tough conversation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> we're going into like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Uncharted Territory </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> AI has literally it's it's a tool so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> powerful that we've had to think rethink </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what is morally right right so you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the AI training itself you know that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> building a tool that can train itself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's incredible right the fact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that there's an AI can train yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two emulate a lot of human art and art </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> made by real people to the point where a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of it can almost seem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> indistinguishable to a normal person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that doesn't understand art of course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now morally being able to train that AI </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> using artwork pre-existing artwork which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have uh you know spent years and years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> perfecting and honing their skills </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> um only to be added to a database to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> help train this AI in order to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basically make a lot of their work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obsolete is that morally correct you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know that's that's that's something that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've not really had to think about yet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I don't know what kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> press I don't know when in history we've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had I'm sure there is something similar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in history that's not going through my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> head right now but it's it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> complicated question yeah where we've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just it's it's something we've morally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not had to think about but we've now we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we now have to think about it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because this one tool is so powerful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you know and I feel it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> difficult conversation to have as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's like it's very much morally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> speaking in my opinion it's very much in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a gray zone right it's like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there are there are benefits to this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of Technology you know expanding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that in the art wall but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as well like you don't have to be an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> artist to know that there are also some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> demerits to it right what a out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> curiosity what benefits do you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there is from having a IRS as opposed to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so a lot of so a lot of the kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> backlash I guess opinions that I saw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about the whole air program coming out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from like actual artists yeah is that in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the in the odd world it's it's very much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a lopsided kind of uh argument men </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of like a lot of people look at it and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go this is a program that is stealing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know other people's art and you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like passing it off as like you know art </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then there are also a lot of artists </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who look at programs like this and go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> well okay but at this point in time it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there is still very much a a limit like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a machine limit of just how it can be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when it when it comes to creativity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right now though so right now let the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> problem is that you're kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> essentially yeah a lot of people are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah it's not good enough now but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like okay you're You're Building </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you're assembling the rope to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hang yourself with yeah in a sense right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because yeah and even to begin with it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> not even like they're they're being paid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're being compensated for this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> artwork being used it's that I think the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> main issue is that people just haven't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> consented their artwork being used to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> essentially yes okay and I'm and I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> against that personally as well of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> course yeah so like the audience got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> pissed off because by buying it or using </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it even though you're not using it for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe nefarious purposes yes by using </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> their services you're sort of kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> condoning it what yeah and I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the problem it's probably because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> there's been such a shift within this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just these past few months right because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the beginning of this at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> beginning I was gonna say beginning of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this year at the beginning of last year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah hey I was just like haha look at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all these funny things that computers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and AIS can do oh look I search my name </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it does this and now it's getting to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the point where oh this is this can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> possibly take people's like livelihoods </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and jobs and now now we have to think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what is morally acceptable in terms of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how this AI has been made and how this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tool has come about okay it's like I'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pose you a question okay so let's let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> say there's an AI that has been trained </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to make YouTube videos to make anime Man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> videos or something like that and it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gets to a point where your videos have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been user trained or like your videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have been used to training I was gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say to make videos about anime but you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's been trained to make videos about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Japan yes in the style of your style </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but it can pump it out way more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> faster and way more consistently than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you could ever and if it looks and it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> feels like a jury video that's a big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> problem right because yeah they've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> essentially used you to replace you and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you don't get a car so I think I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think the problem is that the laws right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now and the way that it all works is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that this was never ever accounted for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yes you know that that someone could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just use your stuff and use it as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> training information because normally if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you wanted to say uh learn how to play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> piano like Mozart and let's say there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> video footage of it for some reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously there isn't but you could just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watch it and it'll be up to you to try </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and figure out how to do it yourself and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no one would bet an eye out there yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but so if you give that to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> machine and the Machine can just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> replicate it one for one and spit it out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like okay well hold on I didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> agree to that yeah when I publish this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> video I want people to watch it I didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> want people to [ __ ] just replace me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with it but but I think at the same time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's going to like say looking at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it from the musical standpoint right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like as someone who has been writing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> music my whole life it's like I find </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that as like uh you know maybe not the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> best way but it is a way to kind of push </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the medium further in terms of its in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> terms of its current limits right it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like okay Carly AI has gotten to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> point where it has gotten pretty close </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or even similar to what humans are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> capable of doing right yeah but at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> end of the day the AI at least as of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right now right there is still very much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a limit that human creativity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cancer pass yeah so right so I think in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the sense of advancing the art medium </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> forward </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you can look at it in a positive in that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way but at the same time as someone who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has seen AI being made also or music </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being made by AI yeah it is also kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> terrifying but at the same time at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> end of the day with any kind of like art </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and stuff like that humans I think are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just naturally more attracted to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something that is made by a human even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if it might be indistinguishable of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> course of course I would like to think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that yeah people like to think they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> smarter than they are and that they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> would never fall for stuff like that but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah we do right like it's just yes I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> mean it depends on the person obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah part of the real like like I said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> we never thought AI would like create a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> field to be one of the fields that AI </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would take over first but yeah uh like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it I think it's just going it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of blowing up the fact that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know even if you think human creativity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is beautiful and amazing which you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it is it's still art is still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> defined and based on rules yes and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> structure you know we talk about you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know we clown on the corner for for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> how music is easy replicatable he like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the same word </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fact that you can study music means </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there is a baseline structure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> um that can be learned and obviously can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be replicated and part of the beauty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes comes from breaking that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> structure and going going your own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Direction going against the convention </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but at the same time that is also based </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the previously defined structure you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know so it's it's kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> uh it's it it kind of is like taking all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> of the gloss off and being like okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is what this is this this is what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your creativity actually is this is this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is all of the things but I think that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why this conversation that's why I feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> though this conversation is so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fascinating right because it makes us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of question okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what is art to begin with now like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know it it does it's like it makes you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of rethink like okay what makes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this one thing artistic and this other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> thing not as artistic right I think with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this specific uh controversy that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happened where a lot of people got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> really upset about the air Arts because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know I think typically online anyway </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well like in the online climate right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now artists who are normally undervalued </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> anyway yes and don't get paid maybe as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> much as they should so it was kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like the the cigarette butt being put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> out on you and you're already down right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah okay so I'm already struggling to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get a fair price for my art and now I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to compete with this [ __ ] that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trained off on my [ __ ] like yeah what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] like for example right uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> another AI situation um remember like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got even like 10 years ago that Eve bot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that one where you could talk to it oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it would like flirt back to you no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there were a lot of yeah it's like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> AI chatbots you'll be like oh how you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing today I'm fine and then you'll be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh you're so beautiful on it which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like it was like a dumb little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing yeah yeah yeah yeah it was kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] but you're like okay well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know you think in the time it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a slightly upgraded clippy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> basically of course you're like this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cool I'd love to help improve this yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the we as humans are so curious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and so fascinated by stuff that we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this is awesome like nobody nobody </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at that time questioned yeah whether we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should get this AI better or not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's like [ __ ] yeah this is cool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah this is awesome this is a little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fun thing I do online with my friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we all laugh about it yeah and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you think oh wait what if it gets good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enough where it can just actually scam </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people online where I could just it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> could DM you on Instagram yeah and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can sound human and it can ask for your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> credit card or some pointers like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it could have an extended </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> conversation with you for weeks and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you could be scammed out of something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like okay now it's like if it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gets too good because we become </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normalized I mean I'd argue that's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> already happening well I don't know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that happens but like I mean it could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> happen it could yeah the point being is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like I think it it's concerning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's already too late yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> already gotten to the point where it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> too good then you're like oh oh we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this whole thing like five ten years ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we thought that's cute that's nowhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> near as good as the stuff we're making </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and this was the the sentiment we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had and obviously now that it's catching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up everyone's kind of scared because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like where does this go yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where is it going to be in 10 more years </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I I think it was just like basic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> human naivety to be like to be like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this thing exists oh that's that's cute </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not a problem I'm gonna have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> worry about in my lifetime let's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watch Sci-Fi movies about it isn't that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so funny right now and now we are in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that sci-fi so yeah there was this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] that was a I don't know who is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Adobe or something there's one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> presentation like I don't know like two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> three four years ago where it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically like off of X amount of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> samples of your voice they could pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much perfectly replicate yourself yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah yeah and that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> terrifying too because like now it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like all right well deep fakes at least </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> those are still uh yeah they're not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> great still like yeah yeah I mean you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can do some really convincing ones but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to have your voice taken feels really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weird yeah imagine that I mean yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know yours is on there on one shrimp </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> shitty one doesn't sound yeah I mean it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't get that but it can get there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and yeah it just raises a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like new morality questions that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> realize oh we are definitely we are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely not prepared </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> apocalypse is coming so they're able to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> make a deep fake so they can make a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> facial uh reconstruction if you can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they could take your voice and then now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they have your video ideas right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um this is obviously only applies to ask </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and this is dude [ __ ] cares if our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> YouTubers get [ __ ] copied yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um but it's just you know yeah I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's no surprise that the creative </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aspects are the first to be uh kind of a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mimicked or uh yeah absolutely because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's also the average everyday person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't care to interact with a robot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that could maybe fix a phone yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe it's cool for someone else but I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna be like I'll go in the art I I'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> give it I'll talk to the funny robot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah why not why are we talking to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> robots </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why why are we humoring them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is where the robot would be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you're a peasant Comics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the robots feels more real than talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to humans okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we would go online and we would just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] chat to a wall right like I saw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the other day um someone had made </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um an AI V tuber yeah I saw that and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was just like it's literally just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the whole Tay thing but just with a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> voice thing there was there was a clip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was going around where they they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> played to me by name huh they mentioned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me by name and I had this clip like sent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to me everywhere and it's like this aiv </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTuber mentioned you by name and I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like how the [ __ ] doesn't Joey messenger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it said Joey the anime man and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like who who are you how do you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> me but like it's just just seeing it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that that also [ __ ] okay so everyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> right now is at the same stage where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like haha wow how cute an aiv </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tube isn't this such a nice cute little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> idea fine I I swear to God in like five </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ten years maybe even sooner no yeah as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> soon as AIS can get to a point where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they have an endearing personality it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] over man being able to stay here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> nice Japan will be definitely be the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first country we are we are literally we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> are literally in the epicenter of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> humanity getting wiped out by vtubers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> manager think about Japan 100 accepted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTuber AI Overlord you know why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you can't get a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> boyfriend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I am waiting for the niji Sanji like aiv </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> super division to come out and just be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I'm sorry but Idol that will never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have a boyfriend never have any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> controversy you know hopefully he won't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> say anything racist I say hopefully </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because God knows what the AI is going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be trained on you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here's the thing how do you cancel an AI </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an AI is uncountable right because it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can only be trained by humans so who are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the real evil not the P or AI it's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] humans that trained it man I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't believe you hurt my feelings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my real feelings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my God that is very poggers yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> bottom line everyone in the creative </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> field is [ __ ] it's on 24 7. but the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bottom line everything every every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> artist musician's a [ __ ] YouTubers are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] everyone's [ __ ] if you work in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh you know some engineering or some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff you're pretty good when you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> using your hands yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought programmers were safe but now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's AI that can do programming maybe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe we go maybe we've got to go back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to the Stone Age maybe the only jobs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that will be left is like manual labor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you know tedious manual labor you know I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> can't dig a hole in the shovel can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we'll just be building huts and filming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that and be like ha [ __ ] you AI yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's see you're trying to build this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> primitive technology YouTubers are just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like my time has gone more except </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they've they've surpassed us when they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can beat us at speed running video games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what I like said what do you mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when an AI I can just speed run a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game on its own and do like the Cheeto </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Skip and all that in the video game it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can already like do but all you have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do is just feed it a task well yeah we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to feed it a test right that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a video basically playing though yeah we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> can figure it out all on its own that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I'll be impressed when yeah when an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> AI can figure out a brand new like skip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> then that's when I'm impressed and I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot less out of everything that's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> ai's could do I think that might be one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> of the easier things bro you got an AI </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's running a video game 24 7. have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you ever watched those machine learning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> compilations of video games after like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] uh two to four weeks they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still dumb as [ __ ] really right now yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right now right now yeah you have to put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot you the AI on its own cannot learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you need to feed it like you need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to tell right like hey you know like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you watch videos of it like uh racing a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> car in a video game like you have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> feed it a lot to get it even remotely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good um yeah but it depends how how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> quickly you can iterate upon itself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> um because there's more computing power </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the more it can help I guess yeah the uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know I'm not an expert in this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] all I know is that they are bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Joey you should be ashamed of yourself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> wow I can't believe me and about a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> million other people uh joining you you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know it's like this is the problem is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of other people don't have comment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> sections yeah yeah but also but also a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of people don't read their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> conversations yeah that's true you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what I'm gonna AI I'm gonna create an AI </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bot that gives me wholesome comments </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that finds out exactly what porn I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna jack off to that day I'm tired of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scrolling quite frankly and I will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> welcome that one it's like oh BBW today </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wasn't really gonna go for that one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but maybe I think that's just the I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> feeling lucky button on Google </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanted to watch the porn I'm watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then decide exactly what I'm into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and when I'm gonna be into it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of death because I I can't trust myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe I'm just doing it for the sake it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pings you on your phone to be like J.O </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time it vibrates like really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aggressively in your pocket yeah to turn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you on it's like your own time here's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the link off you go yeah and it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> already playing on your Chromecast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> please enter the bedroom yeah I mean I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean Jarvis play BBW Paul </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> as you get wheeled in yeah I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you tell me is a feeding tube but not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> something that's sucking my dick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you telling me how to do that manually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> plot hole in it how are they jacking off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't look like it's possible it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> would have happened if Wally was based </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] Japan's already figured that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] out before the AI did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't get as a get into resistance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the [ __ ] you make sure that jacking </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> of those have you have you like because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't go on Tick Tock how is this far </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> away I'm actually going for a jacket on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> today because I got okay I don't go on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Twitter but I have I've I've seen this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happen to other people where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um they've like they've had something on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> their Tick Tock which has popped up that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> has been relevant to like some very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> specific intrusive thought that they've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never like verbalized or anything like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that but Tick Tock is just like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here's a video about that one topic that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you've thought about that's coincidence </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then when you spot it it feels so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much more real than you know just yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a mixture of coincidence and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fact that I think there are so many tick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tocks out there now that have just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> covered every possible internal like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> situation that could be relevant to you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay I want an AI that tells you want my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> next dark thought is gonna be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like an AI that like warns you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before you have the thought it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like stop right now you're just chilling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you have that one thought you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like whoa that was dark </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know you're okay come on I cannot be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> alone in this you know that's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every year you see that on a tick tock </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's [ __ ] up but that's cool that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sick no because like because this has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happened to like Sydney a few times uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where she's just like see Cindy likes to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bring up random stuff sometimes and uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if you found out in Sydney she she says </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the dog says she says every [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> intrusive and non-intrusive thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whether they make sense or not yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one time she was uh we're just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] watching TV or something and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then she just goes to me could you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> survive a tsunami if you like are in a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> swimming pool and you switch to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bottom of the swimming pool and hold </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> your breath </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> should I be offended </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and he was one of those statements no I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just swimming to the bottom bro </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like one of the that he was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of those [ __ ] and it was one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> those moments where I heard a statement </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I didn't even know where to begin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm just I'm just like I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> think this is even worth entertaining </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the thought I'm just like I just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what and she's like no I I think like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> has anyone ever thought about that I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sydney </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I just left that was that you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was like I was like I did not know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where to begin and I was just like John </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> left he went to his computer and he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> started programming in AI </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] you know right [ __ ] you're not yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then like two days later </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um I was I was like she's lying in bed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and she'd go and she goes what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no way and I was like Sydney what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and she she runs down to me and she goes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch this Tick Tock and a tick tock is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> here's why you wouldn't survive if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> swam to a bottom of a pool during a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tsunami and I was just like I thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that that that is that is the creepiest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] I've ever seen in my life and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know if this was like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> subconscious Trend that was happening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> during Tick Tock but I have never heard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anyone pose this question before I just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I just like to think just out of context </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that Tick Tock was just one that Sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> made like that night it's an AIT Target </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like check it out I'm not the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> only one that's thinking this I'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> weird right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> please believe me yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know because I don't know if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've driven Mike when you do you only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> drive a lot and you've driven a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hours and then you sit there and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have that moment where you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah if I [ __ ] this up I die </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I've had that you know when you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just you just drive it like you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like oh this is super chill this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is funny and you do it every day and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you're just like oh wait I gotta I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gotta pay attention </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> not that I'm not paying attention yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you know when you just and no one's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever gonna get him to call me ever again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no but you know what I mean like you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just driving and then you forget how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dangerous driving is until you have that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> moment where you're like oh if I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> turn if I accidentally wasn't paying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> attention I turned a little bit that way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I it would it's over it's it's that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> moment [ __ ] up why do I have those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> thoughts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it was this woman and it was a woman </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> standing like lying on the edge of a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> waterfall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> someone drew quote retreated it and it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was something like nah the voices would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> get me for sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they had like 300 000 likes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the voices </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that's so dark but okay but before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> before I say what I'm gonna what I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to say listen everyone has dark </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thoughts okay I'm I'm I I'm a safe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> driver guys I'm a safe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> God has driven me before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we've had we've had a road trip together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they're in one piece okay yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes you're on a highway right and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you see like oncoming traffic right and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're going like 70 miles per hour and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're and sometimes you get this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all I have to do is just turn the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> steering wheel slightly and everyone's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dead good thing I'm not gonna do that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but what if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you saw this place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like oh good thing I'm not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna do okay but good thing I'm a sane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> human being what if or am I or am I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone collectively has that thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right everyone collectively is driving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so yes they do and everyone doesn't not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> drive safe when they do yeah exactly I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know it's also like when driving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes you especially in Long </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stretches it's I think intrusive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thoughts is different from just being in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like getting into like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> almost vegetative state where you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just so focused on the road that you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> forget that you're going at like 70 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> miles there's a phenomenon right where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know some people if they drive back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to work all the time and it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> relatively short distance some people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> can forget that they even drove to work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that like they don't have the memory of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> driving the car because they've done it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so many times and it's so automatic yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it all just Blends together it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> have you ever had a autopilot moment in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> your life where you just like for sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you wake up from the Matrix and you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like why did I do this I well you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just walking and you suddenly forget </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you're walking you just you don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you don't you don't like have that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> thought that you're actually controlling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> your walking there's no there's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> moment that I'm sure everyone in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> world has experience at least once of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you're just you know you're in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> living room and then you walk to your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> room and then you enter your room and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you just stop and you go why did I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just walk away of course of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone's had that that is that is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an autopilot moment my my brain just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> pre-programmed to be like walk to yours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because like I'll never forget that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like that that's like every day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Welcome to ADHD everyone but like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember like the worst time it happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the part that still like freaks me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> out is I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember this one time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um in University </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um so you know you go to your lecture or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every single day of your [ __ ] life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I remember leaving my house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it was the weekend yeah and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> huh yeah ladies and gentlemen it was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weekend and I was going to meet a few </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> friends in the city center </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um so I start walking I put on my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> earphones uh and then the next thing I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> realized I look up and I'm in front of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my lecture hall and I'm like why the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] did I go here how did I walk it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was the autopilot walk today </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> autopilot walked to the ledge Hall and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not a short walk it was a 30-minute </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> walk what I did not notice that I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> walking to my lecture hall which is the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> opposite direction to where I was going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to meet my mates until I was in front of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the lecture hall dude if that isn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> solid evidence that like fast travel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> exists in real life like I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what it is you just press the button and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you just he's a fast travel to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> lecture travel to the wrong place I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like I glitched down on my way don't you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't actually need to go yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that is It's like because I'm sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone has experienced that I'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh I'm here now but I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> remember how I got here yeah I just I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like oh I just my my feet just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> started walking and I'm here now okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just the pre-programmed script </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just started right it's just like all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> right here we go bro that's so funny </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that's every time I walk back after like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a night of drinking sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> holy [ __ ] I've had like insanely song </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> like so I wake up next day and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> perfectly I'm always home and I always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember getting I remember I always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember going into my door and getting </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> journey that took me there telling you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man fast travel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's IRL faster IRL fast travel it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> exists </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let's uh to keep this like existential </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> crisis going go on I felt it I fell into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like another weird Rabbit Hole the other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> day all right what would you do if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> knew you were about to die </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because okay what what span of time are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we talking are we talking like I'm gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> die within the year or I'm gonna die </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like tomorrow uh within like an hour </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the hour yeah oh [ __ ] because because I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um I got into jail yeah because I got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> into this weird Jr </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not oh my God </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because because uh like I uh got into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this rabbit hole because I like this uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this video was recommended to me about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the Hawaiian like kind of like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> missile alert right so uh a while ago </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like Hawaii had like a fake missile </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> alert where everyone on their phones got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it and got an alert that said ballistic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> missiles are heading towards Hawaii </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right please head to shelter as soon as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> possible this is not a drill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and of course terrifying it's it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> imagine like the earthquake alerts it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like on that except </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically you're being told that a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nuclear bomb a nuclear problem nuclear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ballistic missile bomb is heading </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> towards Hawaii right and Ireland where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] are you gonna run yeah where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> are you gonna run so four battles yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so for about like 45 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of people believed This is the End </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> right this is this is going to be the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> end and like I I saw that video and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I I was just it just like so curious so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I started like reading comments and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hearing stories about people who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually experienced that and it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's interesting just to see people say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you're you're [ __ ] brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chemistry just had their brain chemistry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had changed after that experience just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because they had like made peace </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the fact that they were going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> die and it's I find it interesting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you know in movies and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything like that you you see people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> portrayed as the world's coming to an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> end let's all [ __ ] Panic let's all go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out kicking and screaming but the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reality is so many people were just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> um were just kind of like at peace </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> without accepting yeah yeah I I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about that video of that guy who's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> playing golf oh yeah yeah I'm gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> finish this whole of golf yeah I'm gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get a PB before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> he like I saw that video as well there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a guy who just starts off the video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being like if you're seeing this video I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably didn't make it oh wow and and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> he just he just starts being like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know what I lived a good life this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably the end but I'm gonna finish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> playing this golf I'm gonna go out doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what I have it's such a good video what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a chat what a [ __ ] I think I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the most famous stories actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> uh Jim Carrey who was in Hawaii at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> time all right uh and he I saw a clip of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> him telling his story about it as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well what happened was he got a call </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from his agent being like this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the [ __ ] uh so you know the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> emotion you get is like Panic yeah is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there anything I can do I gotta find my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> friends gotta find my family and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um so he tried calling his daughter I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't think his daughter picked up or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything like that uh but then but then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after after that initial panic's over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like the acceptance kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comes in so then what he did was he just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he just thought to himself everyone's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to get out but then he just he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just said he just realized he didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to die in his car right so he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> walked out to the hotel and just walked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the beach and just sat there and just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought about everything that he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thankful for in life and I'm like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> man that is that must have been an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> experience that you can't like I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know I don't know it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more people like I'm genuinely curious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if anyone in Hawaii </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> went through that experience what was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your experience because I I find that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what happened in Hawaii [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fascinating because it's it's kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a case study of like so many people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> believing that this one terrible thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is going to happen there's one thing you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only see in like films and Cinema and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff like that so you don't normally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't really know how people are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to react or how how you're going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> through around you you can only just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like [ __ ] think maybe I'll do this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> right maybe I'll do that right and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like hearing those stories as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know you know first-hand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> narratives is like you know they you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can hear and you know imagine what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they were going through but like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actual like raw emotions that they were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going through is like that's something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can't just like listen to and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> imagine right like that's something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just like you need to have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experience the amount the amount of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comments I saw that was uh when I knew I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was going out I just started smoking a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fat blunt man I was I was going out high </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> as a guy baby </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like and I am doing everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> strong imaginable before I go I will not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> die sober </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no no that's a good question like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would you do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what I do try and break </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> every law imaginable in an hour try and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> break every law environmentally be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know like like every dark thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have right it's like you know I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sure there are people who are like well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if we're gonna go in an hour yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> might as well try and fulfill that more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> curiosity I've always the [ __ ] giant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> tortoise </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if that's possible okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> okay I'm eating one I don't care if it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> raw okay I I I want to go out eating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good food now I've been thinking about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay I have 45 minutes to find my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> perfect Last Meal which is available in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the vicinity I'm in what the [ __ ] what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would I go with hits honestly McDonald's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> assuming that the workers are happy to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> keep working when the world is ending in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 45. you got to clock out no yeah do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know how many people want Big Macs right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now I gotta give it to him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's probably they're probably just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> giving it away yeah exactly but I wanna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna I wanna know if there's anyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who's like anyone who [ __ ] confessed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> enough enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there's probably someone out there but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also if if you're if you're dying and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then if the other person's dying does </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> confessing help at all like I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because we've never been in that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> situation but what what's kind of funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to think about is like they confess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah and then they didn't they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't so they basically just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> themselves okay can we google if there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> any stories of this happening I'm sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there must have been people who like P.S </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually there's a [ __ ] all along yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] on your paws I wasn't a dog P.S I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> banged your mom </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to know the wholesome stories but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also I want to know what was the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> wildest [ __ ] that was like that happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> during that 45 minutes [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I'm sure yeah some people only have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like an hour left to live I mean some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> people already did break laws oh I'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sure yeah some people probably did and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what he got in trouble for it yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Jesus but they barely part of the movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you wouldn't steal and steal a college I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> not breaking him if I had a year to live </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well I'm starting a meth Empire yeah I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hope one of you boys would be you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my my Hank to me to me Walter White I'd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like to think so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah exactly it's like depending on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why I was asking about the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> frame right because it's like okay if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like an hour right there's only so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> much you can do but like say for example </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you were gonna die within the next </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like say a month yeah right like I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it would be very different I decided </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've decided what I want to do well if I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had an hour left I would film every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> single hot take I have left that is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> unsayable out loud and then I'll post it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I'll die PornHub traffic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> climbed during the Hawaii missile alert </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of course I'm not the only one Owen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going out I'm going out Bull's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> emptied </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what time do you think I should lost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> your time to go out I'm trying to find </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some funny stories yeah that's such a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> good question holy [ __ ] I mean I have an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hour right I can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean I could go through everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like you know there'd be a part of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me that's like I wonder if I can do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to some gay porn you know like I've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never tried so you know maybe now's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> time to like broaden my house it's time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to broaden my horizons that's just every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tag I'm gonna give it a go go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah this is like like because the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reason I fell into this Rabbit Hole was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> reading other people's story because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's so many like nuances and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> little things I never thought about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> until I read about people's experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about it because like yeah if I did have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 30 minutes left how the [ __ ] would my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mind go if I die if I decided to jack </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> off would I would I try something your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would it would I put on [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Masterpiece one last time for like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Victory lap yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's up to you man it's one of your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> brain decide </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd probably be too shocked to think of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything meaningful in one hour you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> when I was a not a lot of time no you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> probably just go back to top right I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean we've already talked for now you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't even you can't even finish a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] trash teeth episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh I have one hour to live I can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> wait to watch my favorite Treasure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no you can watch it two times speed yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I got it Mom I can watch one YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> video before bed the YouTube video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my god oh but yeah I mean it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's interesting just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> or we have these interesting case yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly close to one hour marker just in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> case so right the one at all it's I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think we were about to like reach the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one hour mark so yeah hopefully you put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on this episode if uh missile will cry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if if you're getting like an alert or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something like that a false missile a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> false </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wonder if it would ever come back to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bite if it ever did happen again in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Hawaii there's a missile look but it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> actually legit if people didn't believe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah unfortunately being on an island is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> probably one of the worst places you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> could be during a missile yeah well um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well it's not even like if you had an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hour anyway even if you're on Mainland </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was coming for you if there's any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meaningful Direction you could get to an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hour yeah yeah exactly like that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like two blocks in New York City </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean yeah you can barely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> get out of New York </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you can barely get out without a uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> crisis happening and let's say even if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you were in a metropolitan area or or in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a city or whatever if there was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> missile Alert in a city you're not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting out of the city because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's trying exactly yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's gonna try and leave yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously you know we saw that with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> covid everyone try to leave certain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cities were being locked down yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like we see that even some </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> care about I'm in this beautiful place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I've always wanted to go yeah I'm good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know I do I would like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would record a bunch of YouTube videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that I would set to be public like one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five ten years off my desk yeah that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what I would do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll be like guys it's uh I would have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> been like 32 years old I would have been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 35 years old now how's it going on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> YouTube is it still over Marianne this </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> active I don't know oh my God yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> genius content as well oh [ __ ] yeah has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be paid himself dividends for that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one year and then five years yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> genius you should do that yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah uh he uploaded the video that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would go public you know on yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> have you ever thought about like kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> documenting because there's been few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's been these kind of people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like take taking a picture like every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> day of their life for example yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> plus we do document our lives so that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we literally that was a stupid question </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> we literally have thousands of hours of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> us our lives are two documents against </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the point where I have no memory of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> filming some videos I have no memory of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a good chunk of videos I do not remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> filming them how the process was at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no and now I completely understand why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these people who've been creating their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> entire life are like I have no [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> memory of making that thing because I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get it like my video my YouTube video is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like six years ago if you told me do I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have any memory of making that no memory </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> no no memory not at all I've made so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> many but even not just like Memories </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it gets harder to remember some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like just normal days of your life you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> know even if if you ask me hey what did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you do last Wednesday you'd really have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like think back to it right I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually know what I did last week yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what did you do last Wednesday what's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the date </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was on a plane yeah I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> still sick dying yeah I was dying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because and that's just like last week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know you think you'd remember what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you did last week in good detail but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then go back like what did you do what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what did you do two birthdays ago what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was your birthday celebration and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you go back even further and you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realize how little of your life you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] remember and it's one of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reasons even though like I don't take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> photo I don't take many photos I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never been a guy who has taken photos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's kind of like I kind of realized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how much it's bitten me in the back now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just there is so many like there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's been a lot of trips that I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not kind of let's say documented or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taken a lot of photos off except for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe one photo on my phone yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've just completely I have nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have nothing that to remind me of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trip you know I have nothing to remind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me of that memory because I thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I I had this like I thought before it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like if the Trip's good the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> memories are weird baby I got the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> memories stored up in here baby that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what makes it special and I'm like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> nah that that was a [ __ ] life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> should be like allow me to introduce </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> myself like I'm sure if this the trip is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> special enough for the boys I'm never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna forget it yeah I don't even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> remember half the [ __ ] that happened on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> tour okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah half the days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I think I don't even remember every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> venue God if we didn't so I didn't film </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it I wouldn't remember half the [ __ ] we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> did on our road trip special yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just I remember watching that car the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> road trip special and being like Oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> oh yeah we did I did say that I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> completely forgot that we spent an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> entire day in like a Germantown racing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go-karts and [ __ ] like that until I saw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it in the special oh my God yeah I had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that when I when I first saw that drop I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was like oh we did go here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember that because I remember like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to Ram you off the road oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's right I I completely forgot about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the swan boat though oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right like it's like we were old enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for like like 20 minutes at least 20 30 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes yeah the bread was good though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the bread was good it was good yeah not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like and I guess that's why you know I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm kind of glad that I've gotten more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into the habit of just like taking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> photos because it's like even if it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> might not seem important now yeah that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] you look back five ten years from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> now and being like Oh yeah you know that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't important or anything like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it wasn't important event or a special </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> place or anything but just seeing that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is like yeah that was nice because also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes you get photos of maybe bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> times and you're like [ __ ] I hate that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well I mean that those times you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you could just be like well you know it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> happened so yeah you just yeah because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've I've always like never felt the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> need to take photos because I'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone around me takes photos and they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> upload it to Facebook but hey surprise </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> surprise no one uses Facebook anymore if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like our age so I'm like well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] if other people takes photos oh my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> God I don't post it and parents on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Facebook now sorry I just remember maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we use Facebook appearance yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not funny how that happens well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Facebook used to be this like hip cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing and now it's the thing that is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just showing his age yeah yeah I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's Facebook has become the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> platform that your parents use and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> use to keep in touch with your older </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> generation of parents and stuff like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm glad my parents aren't on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> social media </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so glad I I'm also glad really really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> glad holy [ __ ] I'm glad I blocked my dad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on social media I thought your dad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> blocked you no you blocked no I blocked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> him yeah I I I I look back and I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yep you know back then I was I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> annoyed that they didn't understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> social media and now I'm like thank God </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> my parents aren't on Facebook on on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Twitter aren't doing on posting [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I don't want to see them but I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guess my kid will be like why is my dad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always been on social media his whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like everyone at school knows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> everything about I share a video of my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dad hitting the dab when he's 20. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because because like you know I've have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you seen like pictures of your parents </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and stuff like that when they were young </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and stuff yeah I like that resource </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> video of why do you your parents even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> look old in their younger pictures yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah that's true I haven't seen that one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well think about it like when you see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> pictures of your parents when they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> young they look old still right they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look old even when they're like 20. or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when you look at pictures of like 19 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what was like high school kids in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 70s they look old they look older for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> some reason than high school kids today </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's and yeah and it's this weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like cycle I mean obviously there's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> resource video but like it's like weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> psychological </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trick that happens of like because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from an older time yeah you initially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> condition yourself to look at that and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be like that is an older person yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from before but they still look older </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because your only image of that is this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> thing is old well like also what I find </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would what I'm going to find interesting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going forward is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the world was just never as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> documented as it is now don't they look </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> older </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's high school they don't they don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> look like high schoolers right yeah like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this dude I mean doesn't look like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> high school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I think it looks oh just because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of the just because of the aesthetic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right because you're not sure yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what I'm saying Okay okay then I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get it because I I look back right I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think back and I see photos like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it just feels old because I can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine living in that time zone because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have like the [ __ ] serpia filter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone looks same video you mean sorry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it looks like it's going through like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sepia filter everyone looks different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the haircut's different and I can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> imagine it being in like 4K HD you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what I mean right like I I can't like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't imagine looking around and being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh this is what it looks like in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normal colors in 4K HD and [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that right right which is why when I see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like have you ever seen like old videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that have been remastered with like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> modern colors yeah yeah it freaks me out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so much right yeah it's like that um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's videos that where it's like some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One filmed like Japan in like 1910 yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen that and then they just it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 4K yeah recolored remastered it's cool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it freaks me out because I'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> people are freaked out like what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] is that thing yeah there's that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> camera because you look at this video of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I think there's like one of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Kyoto in like the 1890s or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and it's just weird to think like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh every single person in this video is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> not here anymore yeah and that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> terrifying it's so weird don't say that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's so weird they're characters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> PCS history the whole NPC they're all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> NPCs everyone is a history mpz that only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> exists in the [ __ ] books okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's it's so like it's just so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> fascinating I had that thought with like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> World War II right like yeah growing up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah you had like uh grandparents and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff in here and then now it's slowly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting the point where like in a few </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> years or you know in like 10 something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> years whatever it's like the there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna be so little World War II um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> survivors and within like 20 30 years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there'll be no World War II yeah that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weird to think about yeah growing up you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd always see them on like TV and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they would talk about it and you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this is like a thing yeah and then now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's nobody who remembers it nobody </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who was there yeah you can recount that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> time period yeah like this extremely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> important historical event when nobody </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was alive for it yeah like that's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weird going from having people alive to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it to then not having people alive like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> especially in our time right because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously we can speculate what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Romans were like and stuff but no one in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> our time knows anyone who was ever alive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing that you know what I mean like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weird thinking that that's it's like and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like you know that's how that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there's always I always find that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's this disconnect with history </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right where you know it happens you you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> know that these people existed but they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they also just kind of feels feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> characters in the book that's why it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also cool having this much documentation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right because like I think the older the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> history is the more scarce options we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> have to figure out exactly right so we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> have to like fill in the pieces </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> ourselves sure for sure but like what I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> find interesting is that I have this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> image of my parents when they were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> younger right and you have like I have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like stories that I've heard from like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uncles and aunties and some old pictures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but at the end of the day it's still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just an image of what they were like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't actually know what they were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um our kids are gonna [ __ ] like our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kids are gonna have like every single </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like they're gonna have like every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> argument we've had about bone and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chicken and like if if my kid doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like chicken wings he's gonna [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> know why oh my dad how old is your how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> old is your grandma </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my grandma on my dad's side is around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 97. okay okay this is a weird thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right your grandma that is 97 is like an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> age-wise was is closer to like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Victorian area than like today yeah from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the moment she was born right isn't that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> weird to think that Victoria that we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think of that really quirky time like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] weird where they were doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> weird [ __ ] they were playing like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> asbestos in their wallpaper yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> everything it's like you know it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weird to think there are people who are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> alive today who are old who are closer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to these really far off periods in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> history that we think is far off because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we're born now yeah we think 150 years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ago that's crazy you know what I mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah um like also there was a great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> video where it was like a like 1960s or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 50s this woman who was like 90 and she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was recounting stories of the Victorian </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> period because obviously at that time it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was still you know it was still around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah weird it's just so strange </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> geez that's yeah there's videos of these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people talking about those times so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> strange yeah and it's weird like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know going back to like ancient history </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is weird to think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> we can't we can't really process in in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> our minds just how old like ancient </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Egypt was you know yeah because you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to a point in history and you think oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's all like around the same period </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's all like Roman Roman history Greek </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> history ancient you know ancient </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Egyptian history so it's all the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's all history but like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't it like the ancient Egyptians were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as all to the Romans as the Romans are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to us yeah something along those like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that like some great civilization make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it feel like it's all one blur yeah when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you actually look at the time between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you like whoa yeah I think yeah because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I saw something similar whereas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it was a lot like that but like say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with like the dinosaurs right of like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think it's something like in our heads </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we think like Tyrannosaurus Rex and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stegosaurus are just like yeah they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around the same time like it's it's you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know it's all during the dinosaur era </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but in actuality I think between </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the stegosaurus and the Tyrannosaurus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Rex there's like 400 million years oh no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're uh humanity is a [ __ ] footnote </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> compared to how long the dinosaurs yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the world but it's just so crazy to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think that it's like yeah they're the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> same thing they're around the same time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's just not even like we like to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think that we're better like huh look at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these dumb animals they got wiped out by </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] media bro we've like hardly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we've barely lived the amount of like we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> have been we live have lived a fraction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the time they have Ruled the Earth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and then all it took was like one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] day and they're like gone you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know it's it's because they didn't get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> along </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we wiped out more of us than anyone else </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no meteor can take that away from yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's we killed way more of us than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that [ __ ] dumb meteor ever would have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right there's just four flexing on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the meteorite we are the best at killing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> us yeah without now no one is better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> than us that's why I was smart just to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] kid however if the ants decided </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to have an uprising we would be [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh absolutely absolutely if the answer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> decided they have had enough of being in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the ground if the insect world decided </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to start a coup d'etat one day like they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> can overtake us in a day well that just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that just [ __ ] remind me do you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something weird I've been doing in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> holidays are you collecting ants </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> um I haven't been collecting thank God I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> would have been this is I do not want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> get it I'm not mailing don't worry about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been I've been reading a book </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like in 2023 like like a book book like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wow words like not not even like a light </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> novel like a heavy like no pictures like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no pictures wow it's just a heavy novel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so yeah I've been reading this uh sci-fi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> uh sci-fi novel called children children </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of time you ever heard of this book </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's I but maybe you have maybe you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> haven't I don't know I just uh I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um I know you haven't you don't read I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hear what people talking about oh okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my God what are those funny things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I mean it's I've heard of a book </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> before you know those it's it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> read about a book yeah it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fascinating read uh because I I heard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something I heard something about the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> book that kind of like piqued my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> curiosity uh because it explores the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> idea of like what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what aliens actually are and what's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Evolution actually is right so uh the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> premise the premise of this book right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is Humanity at the beginning of Like A </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Flat Earth a conspiracy theory yeah what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is evolution let's break it down let's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pray let's break it down so it it poses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this question so it's the book is set in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the Far Far Future where humanity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like an advanced race or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that and there's this one person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who just goes let's let's do an epic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experiment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> um let's try and give monkeys these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> virus this virus that speeds up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Evolution put them on a planet and see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what happens okay and then I one day and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then eventually when they become as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> smart as us I will come down and be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their new Gods right okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but unfortunately sorry Connor the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the plan goes wrong all the monkeys dies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh but what happens instead is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spiders instead get infected by this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> virus all right that just kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just speeds up evolution and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh speeds up Evolution and knowledge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically like that um so what happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is it follows why spiders [ __ ] man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like the worst people to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> events but that's that's why spiders </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because when we think of what is alien </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to us like what is more alien to us and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> un understandable than spiders and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fascinating to think for one it may like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it cemented the realization that if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> aliens exist there's no [ __ ] way we'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be able to communicate with them or like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like have any resemblance to us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatsoever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um because it really like it it follows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this spider civilization that emerges </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from like I guess their Stone Age to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their Modern Age right and it shows how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different basically everything in their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> civilization would be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um from like human civilization </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um just based on what spiders are so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a great example is it of this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Midway through the book slight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spoilers but it's only like a small </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scene Midway through the book uh one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the advanced humans crash land on this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> planet right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and the spiders kind of like they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they take they they take this human in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they start studying this human </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and they come to the conclusion that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> humans must be [ __ ] dumb man because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no there's no way that spot that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no way that it can communicate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um because spite of the way spiders </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> communicate is they don't have ears they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> communicate through vibrations yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they form this communication system with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> vibrations through their webs to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> communicate complex ideas to each other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's humans who's this human who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is barking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> voice like Sound Vibrations to them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like nah there's there's no way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any animal would use sound as a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> vibration like medium that's that's dumb </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why would people do that yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no way that any animal would any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> animal would evolve </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um an orifice that they use to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> communicate and also ingest food that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just seems sub-optimal why would any why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would I know any animals do that and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spiders come to the conclusion that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> humans are these uh dumb animals that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have not like reached Evolution </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything like that and it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's so much about this book that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like opens your mind and like makes you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rethink what is it about like our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> society and our civilization that as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is based on us basically coming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> from [ __ ] monkeys and everything like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that so basically if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ants do like decides do an uprising it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably going to be a different kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] Uprising than anything that we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can [ __ ] imagine and everything like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that I don't know like I think it's easy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to think that Evolution just stops </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you're like everything I get it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now I understand how every animal is and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> how we are but obviously it's kept it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> been going on for millions of years and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it'll probably keep on going yeah people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> will get like [ __ ] Tails I'll be sick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we might grow another arm who knows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who knows where humanity is going to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like millions and millions of years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if we live as long as if we live as long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> as the dinosaurs that would be pretty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting I'd like to think the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spiders are watching me and they're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what is he doing it's just me watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Dave </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this must be a complicated human ritual </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's just like that Meme where it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like you know people look back on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the memes and they try to study like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] low cap images or something this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> must have been some ancient religious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> text or something like that do you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that actually happened with like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Angels yeah yeah yeah yeah we've I swear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they've been studying cases where we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought it was something we were so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wrong multiple times because obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you get more information and you you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know the world's become more connected </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's you know a lot of information </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we had in English was based off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like wrong accounts and all also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> resources that weren't really great and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so now we can we can translate and stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so it's much better yeah not that we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing right now could you imagine if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like some archaeologist was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stunning like ancient Egyptian like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hieroglyphs it can be like oh we we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still haven't like uncovered what this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meaningful message must be because they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> left it on this wall and then you you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know you go back 4 000 years and this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> suggestion is just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what are these strange golden like M </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Signs they've put everywhere yeah they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seem to be there must be the cult of M </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they should be in every place in Mass </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's been some ancient religion yeah a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> really crucial part to the human's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> existence </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I mean we found sir we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> found more golden M's lying around what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> could it mean there's so many of them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what could it mean there's so many in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this one continent in America there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> seems to be a density of these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my god oh man it's uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it would be interesting to think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a [ __ ] sick book though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they should make that into an anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're not okay honestly it's like if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you if if you like me kind of sounds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like terraformers but less anime because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like the terraformers if it was smart </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's terraformers if it like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's there's so many interesting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ideas like eventually the spiders </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um learn how to make computers but they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> learn how to make computers via </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> programming like ad programming like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> programming ants off this [ __ ] [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I'm just like I never thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about it like that but if you could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> learn to program ants via because ants </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ants have like a real ants have a set of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> programming right it's you think about a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> normal Ant and the stupid as [ __ ] but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> somehow ant colonies if you study ant </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> colonies they're able to do some [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> incredible things dumb individuals smart </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> together we should make ant AI </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or would it be real intelligence no AI </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stands for ant intelligence </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> dude when the ants see what we did to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them they're gonna be pissed they see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all these tick tocks people owning them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bro it's over dude it's over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my God it's like I'm sorry Malin this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> uh she's the person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like all the pesticides right they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> already evolve to kind of be Beyond it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we're constantly chasing the next </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one yeah we'll get to the point where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> using this pesticide is just not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> feasible because it's so dangerous to us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah uh well if you think about it so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> many like modern inventions and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything are based on nature itself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because Nature has figured out how to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this yeah man yeah so they're trying to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make like this smart machines like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Engineering Systems where they're based </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on like uh real life structures because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a like where they try and make uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> these like kind of RC planes that are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> based more off like Wing structure like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> birds yeah yeah exactly yeah obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> over Evolution they've evolved a way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that works best yeah because because one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> day some dude looked up to this guy saw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a bird flying and went I won't do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> no it's like how do you like that's how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it started yeah makes you wonder like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how would you how would you would planes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> be any different today if Birds just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't exist right so we just don't have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that framework if they just wasn't an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> animal yeah it's the way that like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> plane works is very different well I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guess well they have wings right well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I mean it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I guess what part of engineering </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you care about I mean because it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we just stuck a [ __ ] explosion on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there because we couldn't figure out how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do it in a way yeah it works the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that they do it so we had we had a strap </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] jet fuel that it burns you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like the Wright brothers didn't have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that right they they steam I think no is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it steam oh no diesel no it was diesel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sorry of course it was pretty in diesel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> engine yeah Kai look it up yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> probably a diesel engine right we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> getting to the point of trash days where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're just kind of like spewing [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> over the bed because it was like it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like they had the a compact and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> lightweight enough system that could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that made it so you could power that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and all you need to do is make an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> aerofoil which is basically just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that just catches the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> drag yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um and then you just [ __ ] power It </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Forward </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> all right all right yeah you know small </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> explosions all the way yeah Humanity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> since the beginning boom that's that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> all that's all we love everything they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> saw an explosion they saw momentum and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they went what if we just attached that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you that's how you want to make a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lightweight system now it is getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> closer and closer in a sense to either </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> either the the amount of power we can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> generate or the size of electricity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> needs to improve a lot or you kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get it closer to I suppose you can get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a bird wing and you can maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get it more perfect in the sense there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but it depends what you want to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because Birds can't like uh Birds a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of the time coach flap in place right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if you want a drone yeah stop birds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't do that I mean besides but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> hummingbirds do yeah right but then how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do you how do you like generate that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah certain dragonflies and stuff yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dragonflies are the best flyers in like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> nature holy [ __ ] like I sometimes I see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a dragonfly fly maneuver and it's insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you just reminded me like I mean they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made mid-flight yeah I'm like that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> hippie like it literally now that I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> think about I remember as a kid thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like dragonfly flights patterns look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like they're pre-programmed yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah he literally like [ __ ] that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> incredible yeah I guess yeah depending </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> on what kind of plane you'd want to make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but what it would need to do you'd pick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the aerofoil right on the face I guess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you could there's nothing saying you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't make a dragonfly-esque system I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think you just need it all to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> balanced and you need a way to power </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that much force yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> also that'd be a lot of G's I think if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're whipping around that fast yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah don't don't dragonflies go through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the the most IG force or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> animals going from static to room yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah that's a lot that's a lot yeah no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're not good at that well obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because we've got [ __ ] legs and we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> heavy dragonflies are [ __ ] light of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] yeah but also often a lot of times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like birds and like like um a lot of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> times their skulls kind of evolve to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> certain things like um woodpeckers they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just wrap their tongue around their </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> brain to absorb it you know that are you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> serious your tongue wraps around their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> brain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's right I'm trying to Google this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] that's crazy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if you like got into a car crash and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just like hold on I'm Gonna Save </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> myself from getting an aneurysm that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> legit yeah look at this look at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> diagram the the tongue wraps around the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brain oh that's epic [ __ ] like give some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of cushion to their brain because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like they just like nature just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up hentai like concept you know what I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what is that okay okay explain that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> concept to me let's break it down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> tell me that or something tell me the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> plot what's the plot oh [ __ ] awesome </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's something new man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> hey I can't call for that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we [ __ ] up Humanity we've trained an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> AI to like come up with [ __ ] with brain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> with brain wrapped tonguing brain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wrapped oh my God yeah maybe she's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> thinking of all different types of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> planes now it makes me wonder how how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> did how did the invention of like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> helicopter how did that get like dude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's actually a [ __ ] [ __ ] sick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> history uh because the guy who made it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is a [ __ ] psychopath he just was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to be like I look like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> helicopter he was like determined to die </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like if you look at the history of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the models of how I made it I swear one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the dudes who was trying to make it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was like actually insane yeah like it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> crashed so many times right but he just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kept trying to make more because he was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like dead set on it there's also like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> genius invention really yeah yeah I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I I mean I I don't I I fully believe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that because I look at a helicopter and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're just like that shouldn't fly I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I don't know what I'm talking about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we're living in a simulation I always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought helicopters were way cooler than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> planes I was a helicopter gang all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> way wait how was team helicopter I do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> not have this like you just you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like when I saw like a battle helicopter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's just purely based on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> fact that like you don't see you don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> see helicopters as often as planes yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sure and all the helicopters you see are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of lame they're all kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know normal ones but they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> actually the ones with guns like whoa </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something in your boy brain you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh that's cool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it's also just the like the idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of the helicopter let's let's spin this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> thing so [ __ ] kind of fast that we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> could fly as a kid I'm just like yo I'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just fly but stain yeah just just stay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in the air yeah planes you're just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's got a [ __ ] engine to like making </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> her pew pew pew I don't [ __ ] care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about that let's try spinning some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] blades to get you up in the air </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's metal as [ __ ] man yeah you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's badass yeah which makes all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> more funny when have you seen those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> videos where you see like the helicopter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like taking off but like the frame rate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of the camera shutter speed yeah so it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just looks like it's staying still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> someone just turned ground yeah it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looks like it's suspended in the air and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just like going up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first person to discover that is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> genius it's like a [ __ ] Looney Tunes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> walk you through the camera and they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like what the [ __ ] well I mean uh I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it happens a lot natural like so when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're filming now right like obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh a lot of light flickers yeah you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're in Japan I don't know which side </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're on it's either flickering 50 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> times a second or or 60. yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously it's not actually like fully </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going on off but it's you know and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes on camera you set the hurts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um if you set the shutter speed to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wrong thing or yeah you have it on maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a different anti-flicker mode yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you'll see it like the waves yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> appearing on them so sometimes you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even actually seeing like flickering </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> slips yeah you see it pretty [ __ ] bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've got a lot of video footage where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's happened and you're like God damn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's [ __ ] unusable yeah it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> flickering yeah well there's a there's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of that you know the human sensors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can't take in there's so many like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spectrums of light and everything like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I imagine if you could see [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> infrared and that's [ __ ] sick like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> love the um you know the mantis shrimp </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I [ __ ] love that that thing's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> cool it's one of my favorite things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's one of my favorite animals of all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> time yeah that's the stories of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> busting glass because it's just it like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like boils the air yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it literally creates almost like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> nuclear explosion from how fast it moves </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of in Terms like the heat and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> pressure it creates it's just like boom </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a sonic boom basically yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's Sonic moves yeah it's kind of crazy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that like fish could evolve to that I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> wish we [ __ ] evolved to that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like yeah I look at the mantis </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> shrimp and I'm just like [ __ ] we go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wrong yeah wait wait where the [ __ ] did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we go wrong you know because like how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> One shrimp one shrimp in history saw a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> clam and thought the only the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> optimal way to get inside this clam is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> punching the [ __ ] out of it I'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's isn't it crazy on paper if I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> asked you can't yeah do you want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> intelligence or do you want an arm that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> can [ __ ] boil air you'd be like I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> would like the arm that boils yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> would like to see every color please </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's more colors I can't see and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then these [ __ ] little shrimp but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll just on the [ __ ] ocean floor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and we're the ones who evolved well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't that [ __ ] dumb because when I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> playing I feel about this when I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> playing d d I'm like I'm like man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously I'm gonna spec into like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Wizardry or like Charisma I never put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> anything in intelligence because they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> always get it no they always get it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wrong in video games intelligence should </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> be way more op in video games yeah this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is humanity is what happens when you try </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to balance out all the skill points </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we just average on everything compared </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to the Animal Kingdom we put all of our </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stats into intelligence yeah we can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> even appreciate that yeah we're not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> intelligent enough to appreciate that at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> all right all the points in intelligence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and the ability to throw things that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty much everything we did yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we're pretty good at running </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well I mean compared to like a cheetah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> well that's the thing a lot of animals </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like opposable thumbs that's pretty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] op yeah a lot of animals can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> run like marathons oh that's true we can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> run for pretty long I mean I can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't get that some of us some of us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> are pretty [ __ ] beautiful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll let them do it I'm I'm I expect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> into the intelligence trees all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> all right sorry I don't want me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> do you know humans have a no way of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sensing wetness no I heard that oh I saw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this we just know there's like we can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tell the temperature different though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I saw that yeah I found that really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting because I'm like how many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> other things can't I sense but I can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just sense like sense a bad take when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you have it guys that's another thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't say it's a dark thought before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we haven't built those receptors yet I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> can sense whether a fart is gonna smell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or not very far </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's really yeah I think I'm pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> confident </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I I like you're like test it better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what's your Source I I made it the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] I feel like I just know I just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know when a father's gonna smell okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this is this is something in my my bow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> tells me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do you feel like you can tell if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> someone's looking at you yes yes why why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> why do we feel like we can tell like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I've had I've had points where I've been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like asleep or just like napping or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> something and I'm like someone's looking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> at me I look up and someone is I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> going wait who is that someone okay well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that's okay that's [ __ ] first of all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's just coincidence </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think we take a note to like again I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> think we saw some previous episodes um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're like again with extremely socially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> focused animals yeah and so I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like an evolutionary trait that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of been like malfunctioned a little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> bit where we don't I guess we kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> still need it but we don't need to be as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> socially accepted as we once needed to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so we were very attentive to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> anything social for the most part so I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think when when people are staring at us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we're really apparent of it and we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really bad at even like thinking Scott </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just staring at me like I feel like God </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was just staring at me right yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like you're just looking at my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> direction I saw in the corner of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mouth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> overthink it yeah we can kind of sense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if like someone is Feeling Again a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> certain way or like if a situation is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> uncommon that's my [ __ ] theory that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could be totally wrong I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's where it comes from is that we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very very in tune with being socially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I mean like you want to know if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ask any other animal it's like uh so can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you tell if that prawn is feeling then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll be like no I can't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what does that mean why would you why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would you need to sense that God dogs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are [ __ ] cute though I wonder if a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dog knows a dog knows I'm staring at it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a dog noise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean it always knows it always like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dog can always tell like when when when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're like giving it some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> attention you could be on the other side </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my dog used to do that when it was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like kind of just sitting there just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like staring off into Blank Space </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes I would just you know look at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my dog because I'm like you're a good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> boy you're a pretty boy and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes the dog would just kind of do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> walk over at me like what what do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> want every every time you know like I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm torn right in my head and whether I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think God exists because I'm like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God makes stuff that that kills children </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like that's pretty [ __ ] out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but then we also have videos like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dogs cuddling people who are sad and I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like well how do you explain that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know why the dog evolved to know when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're sad and it helps us that's pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like somebody must have helped </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that out come on yeah we don't we don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> deserve it you know look what we've done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in history do we really deserve that we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> don't maybe we should not think of God </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as this omnipotent meaning that knows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything maybe if there is a God in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this world they can make mistakes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> um and I'm just saying dog like when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they created the dog that was like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is the biggest W of my [ __ ] life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this is the only reason why we accept </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> NTR because dogs exist I think we'd all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be done I think they would have been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that would have been the final straw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there needs to be an equal evil to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> create an equal Doctor Who has bought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this omnipotent power so much time yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> frankly you know and I I I and people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who are allergic they got done dirty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but they came alive yeah and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] like God was listening to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] Metallica one day and I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] mantis shrimp man I'm gonna make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> one of those let's [ __ ] do it there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> some whack [ __ ] that has been like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> evolutionized so you're like that that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the Mantis trip is certainly one of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like this feels like the most over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> engineered Evolution to a problem right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right when you think about it you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this feels like respect far too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> much for no reason it's it's like I look </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at the mantrum though the reason I love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the mantis shrimp is I don't think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the most optimal way to achieve what you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to achieve which is get food yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but I respect the fact that you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> committed so hard to this one solution </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like you look at you know an animal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a highly intelligent animal like an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> octopus right that is like all right you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know it can problem solve it can like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know figure out more intelligent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ways to catch its prey like camouflage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like tricking its prey meanwhile </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mantis room is like I punch hard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I destroyed I like the fact that for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some reason obviously it makes sense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> evolutionary wise but just owls could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just [ __ ] turn their head mostly all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the way around yeah yeah that feels like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the owl was kind of been a little lazy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right I'm not gonna lie I feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the owl could have maybe just turned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around a little bit just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> all right you know it's like no I'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> moving my body you really need to turn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> up like if I could turn my head all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> way around do I really need that I feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like it I don't know man to be honest if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> someone asked me hey would you want the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ability to very much a shower thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah would you want the ability to turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> your head almost 360 degrees Yeah I'd be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I don't know when I'd use it but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> sure well why not what I want to know is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you know we we talk about like animals </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and food chain and even if you don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like an animal or something we love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> talking animals yeah we love animals </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> animals are sick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um having said that is there a single </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> redeeming quality of a mosquito or can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we remove mosquitoes and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure something will be effective </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there'll be no adverse effects at all I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think I remember seeing like some videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about that of like some like experts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> argue that we can but with like a little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bit of a of a deficit to the food chain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then there are others that say like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no it's just completely if we've learned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything we are really [ __ ] bad at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> getting involved with the [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to control nature we've been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we've historically have a terrible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> tracker yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> um yeah which is pretty bad in it kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the sentiment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> um we shouldn't do it we're just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what if we just make this animal extinct </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it won't it won't [ __ ] up the food chain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right the animal Kingdom's like what are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you doing stop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know they're delicious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> very precisely and you're [ __ ] it up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I just want to know if there's any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything any animal anything that has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something positive to say about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mosquitoes well do animals hate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mosquitoes problem so I'm sure even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> spiders like I mean I eat them but I can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> go without it flies too flies you know I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I can live without mosquitoes you know I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hard to say man is there anything cooler </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> than a mantis shrimp I don't think so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm I'm a Google is now coolest animals </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> well there's that there's that video of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the guy who was like out fishing in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> canoe and he like fit he accidentally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> fished up a mantis shrimp and it like it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> quickly like flicked him in the in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> toe like just like oh yeah he broke it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it broke his top yeah I almost saw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that and he's like he's like and then he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like releases it back in and like his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> foot is bleeding and then later on he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I I'm in the hospital because uh my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> toe is broken I'm like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's pretty [ __ ] wild yeah that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> wild </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> God I think I think I've evolved to just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> drink tea it's just it's just British </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't it I was on the plane back uh from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> my Christmas break and I swear to God it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was embarrassing the amount of tea I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drank I just kept asking for more tea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they were like and they came around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they were like T I was like yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bring it I think I drank like 15 Cups of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Tea holy [ __ ] isn't that insane why is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that because I was just I was thirsting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for some hot liquid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's what I like all right honestly ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> since moving to Japan I drink far too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> much green tea I don't know can you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drink too much green tea because I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely drinking it's got caffeine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you actually can drink too much tea </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um there's some like uh there's a few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chemicals in it that are pretty bad if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you drink it like all the time all day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> um but like anything that's like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right if you ate just [ __ ] ham yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just lettuce you'd have no nothing else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right everything in moderation generally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah oh yeah I'm just like how much tea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is like too much tea you know um I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely surpassing it I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but that's a problem for future me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I feel like I'm in the now you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm I'm trying to worry about that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's that's the video you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> should make five years from now being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the tea didn't kill you sorry about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that you know how it is you should film </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it while you're sipping a cup of tea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like I bet you're mad yeah that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like that's like a fault in like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> human evolution we are so we are so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> inadequate in try with like we can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> process problems that will happen in our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> future but we're so inadequate and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> caring about it you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yep that's why global warming has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> been yeah right I was just about to say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like climate change activism like first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> time yeah like hey your body is going to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> deteriorate if you don't exercise and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> keep healthy every day and you know eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good and you're like yeah but one more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hamburger right one more Burger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> literally every person who smokes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> cigarettes is just like yeah I know but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's future me to decide I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm enjoying it right that it takes so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much energy just to like care about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and change your life for the better it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just it just yeah some something's wrong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with the brain the creatures of habits </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> man when we get in a habit we it's hard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> for us to kick lately we didn't put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enough points into intelligence </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've programmed our brain to work in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the best way it can and it's got a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of flaws yeah yeah right I mean I did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> program I'm [ __ ] lazy someone else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> did that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know it's weird we're pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> dumb though that's one thing I do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think you think you think we are I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're pretty [ __ ] dumb we're all some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty [ __ ] done dumb Apes just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> floating through a rock through space </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Apes have a good they stopped at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right time Evolution wise I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're they're chilling oh I have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> great time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well they get to have all the you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that orangutang or to drive that golf </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cart in that one video and he didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to get a license </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know you didn't have to go to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> DMV I think he got the best part of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> evolution which is like sit back relax </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> eat bananas chill out they can get to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> drive a golf cart dude I'm just jealous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they get to flick their turds without </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> any repercussions man like I wish that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> my doctor we should have stopped at dogs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> dogs I'm just I I don't think we evolved </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we don't we didn't evolve from it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't matter evolutionary world of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> dogs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> at dogs man the Council of dogs is this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nothing more pure than just a dog I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> think a dog </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if the world was only dogs would dogs be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> friendly to each other I don't think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah maybe the reason why dogs ended up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> evolving is wholesome and awesome as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they did is because of the filthy human </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dogs just agree we tampered and it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worked for once </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was when it was we did a massive W </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for once what about cats </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> they do they they already own the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> let's pull the strings from those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Shadows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> can't live in their world yeah what do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you mean it's since the beginning of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Egyptian age we've worshiped [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> cats yeah I wonder what it is about cats </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that we just we can't help but just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> gravitate towards since ancient times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Humanity has not changed they're cute </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cats could be like the biggest [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] in the world and humans are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like I [ __ ] love you and I would die </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for you and they are completely right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> cats cats are literally the same humans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> do that to other humans you're a giant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> piece of [ __ ] but I love you like cats </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are basically the cigarettes of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> animal wall they're just like I know </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> I'm this close to [ __ ] abducting her </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from our neighbors man who needs to she </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was coming to you yes yeah exactly she </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is when when she knows when when uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when we haven't been uh when we've come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back from like a long trip from like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan or something like that the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> day every first day she's always like so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> loving so everything we feel loved we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like we're back over then every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other day after that she just goes back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to normal all right you've had your time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now I'm just gonna I'm just gonna sit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> here and just judge you I don't want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> give you too much sir yeah yeah no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more serotonin for you sir </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> oh man what was your cat like when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> grew up because you yeah I had a few </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cats </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um a few yeah wow yeah we had well when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was born we had two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but like my my parents had three the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whole time uh Pocky and little guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um it was it was weird because it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you have two cats living in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same house it you really see the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> personality differences right right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like when you just see a cat by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> itself it's like okay you know you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> discern maybe some like personality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> traits of the cat right the different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cats that you know but like when it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two cats next to each other it really is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like night and day yeah uh so like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think like I mean I don't remember a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whole lot because I was really young but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I remember like little guy was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely the [ __ ] in the family </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um he would he would do this thing where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I don't know if you had like memory </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> problems or whatever but like we would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feed him right and then literally 30 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> minutes later he'd come back and be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where the [ __ ] my food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I do that meowing at my dad yeah and my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> dad's like [ __ ] I've just fed you leave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me the [ __ ] alone and he just be like no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm still hungry give me my [ __ ] food </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> all little guys just being like I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> still hungry give me my food where is it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just I don't know like I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> loved both cats equally for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different things but it's just like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really does just show like how these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> animals just have like really just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> distinct personalities and it's like and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's dope you know like you know like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> even like when we had we used to have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a lot of birds as well right like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my parents currently owned like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cockatiel right now and like compared to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the last cockatiel we had this one is a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> million times more of an [ __ ] but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like but it's forgivable because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's cute and the couple of times that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it falls asleep in your hand it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what all the bite marks you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> gave me over the years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I've always wondered about birds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why don't they just fly away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what do you mean like what stopping them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just flying away oh I mean our last </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> cockatiel floor yeah right yeah is there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a point where the bird goes hold on a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> second you just fly and never come back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or actually our first our first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cockatiel uh z uh he actually flew away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then he flew into because you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we live next to the National Park yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he flew out but then got confused to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like holy [ __ ] where am I because we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could actually see him circling around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like trying to find us and then what he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ended up doing was he just nosedived </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into the the the the the forest and so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my dad and I went out to actually go and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> find him uh you know hoping that he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't fly off somewhere yeah and after </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like a 20 minute search we we heard him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> we could hear him chirping and I looked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> up at this tree and he's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> perched on top just like looking down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like [ __ ] help me where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the [ __ ] where am I the [ __ ] have you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been if I saw the bird guy I'd be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah we're not getting that yeah so the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> original plan right was like my dad I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> took off his jacket and was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right call him down like to know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we're here and then the moment he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like lands anywhere I'm gonna put the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> jacket on top and like wrap him up so he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't like freak out and fly away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> somewhere right so that was the original </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Appliance of like we're calling him down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like looking down being like is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> safe is it safe and he he flies down he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lands on the shoulder but and as soon as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my dad was about to put the jacket on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> him I was like no I don't think we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> should because this [ __ ] was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> gripping onto my shoulders like no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tomorrow it was like it was hurting it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just like I am not leaving your shoulder </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so what ended up happening was it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like a 20 minute walk back to the house </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah he just [ __ ] stayed there oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's cool he just didn't move he was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like take me home right now please </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so like what what the normal like why do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> birds not fly away sometimes like why do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they just um do they ever come back if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they like well I think it depends on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like how the bird was raised so like if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was raised in captivity its entire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> life then it doesn't know the concept of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> flying away uh okay right but if if it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> say from like you know you take it from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the wild then obviously they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to be more prone to be like why am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I in this [ __ ] rooms like just fly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> away like it's like a dad too and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just come back like a thing for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some birds I have no idea how how it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to own a bird as a pet I think I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> think for some birds yeah I mean it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> depends obviously on how long you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like kept oh it's like dogs as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right like some dogs run away but then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there are accounts of a couple of days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> later the dog just shows up in your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> front porch yeah this is like what I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> miss you yeah and what did I miss Karen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do this time whereas like some dogs just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> run away and you never see them again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right so I think it just depends on like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the attachment factor of the animal yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess dads do that too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so I guess you know it's not that's how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you need to do the birds of dogs yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you need an AI to stop that yeah I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I know all living creatures do that my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so it was like it was really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fascinating that like you know that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even with because you know I never had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that concept of like birds having that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> idea right because I was kind of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same as you when I first started owning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a bird of like oh we have to be careful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where every time because they might just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] fly away just like Scout every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] like crevice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but then you know there are some places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like uh you know you could like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> interact with like an owl or like an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> eagle or like a bigger Bird yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're not attached to anything but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're just like chilling out and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're just like they could fly away at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> any time but they're just like nope you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> know what um I like it here I think I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna stay here yeah yeah so it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interesting I've I've never I've never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> owned a bird before uh but I have seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one grow up before this is this is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a really weird story uh that this talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has just reminded me of so when I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> living in Thailand uh my house in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Thailand is like over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is uh over like a pond and I kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think uh we have we have a pawn next to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Big Spender </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean it's perfect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's Thailand okay we know we live we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> live on like the outskirts of Bangkok so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a bit more in nature </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and near like uh near the rooftop and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> everything like that or just on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> balcony Birds would like like to make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nests and everything like that uh and so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my office uh in Thailand I sit right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> next to a window that has a really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really good view of the places uh of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> place where Birds would love to make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> their nests and everything like that and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so one bird made a nest that was kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like right right next to my window uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> almost next to my window right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> um so I I saw basically that a bird had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> made a nest and like I saw that you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she had laid some eggs and some beef and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some mice uh birds like some baby birds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have had had hatched and every day I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would come down and I would see the mum </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feeding them and slowly and slowly I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would see them like you know grow up and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I will never forget this point because I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would I would see them every single </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> day I saw these little chicks grow up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and there's a day where I saw their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first flight all right well I saw that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first flight and it was it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interesting for me because I've never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seen how birds just learned to fly yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right uh initially I just thought okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Instinct they just know how to fly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um nope they uh that that doesn't happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually yeah and well at least that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not what I saw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um so actually the mother helps to teach </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them how to fly right so what happens is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh he's here's me like I'm sitting I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sitting on my window there's the nesters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over there and what happens is the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mother flies to like the little it flies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my window and it like chirps at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Chiclets it's like come on come here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I'm gonna teach you how to fly come </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on come on come on you can do it you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and initially uh and initially the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chick's like all right I can do this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> immediately does it right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then but then I think something just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> clicked and in his brain to be like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was scary actually that was I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the air and mind you between my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> window and where the nest was was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pawned it was just water right so if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they fall they're [ __ ] drowning yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and so the mother flies back to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the nest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and and she she continues chirping for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the chicklet to fly back to the nest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> one minute I'm not doing that one minute </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> passes doesn't do it Mom flies back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flies through the nest again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chirps again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three minute passes doesn't do it the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> chicklet looks at his mum and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then after the mum chirped really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> loudly this one time chicklet just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stands on the edge looks at his looks at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> his mum </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shits himself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not joking get it confident I'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> joking I'm looking at this bird his </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mum's like chirping he shoots himself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then he takes off and it's a low </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> takeoff and at this point I'm I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> invested in this book because I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thinking to myself if this bird falls in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I'm running out of my office and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm diving into this Pawn to save this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bird yeah I see this bird growing up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this bird ain't dying on his first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> flight and what happens is he takes off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but he's too low he's like flapping his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> wings yeah and he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what happens is the nest is purged up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there he hits uh he hits the little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> balcony before the nest yeah he like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> panicly like like tries to grab on tries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to grab on flaps his wing I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> halfway through running out but luckily </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> he just got enough elevation to get his </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> foot on the nest and I was like oh my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] God I'm so [ __ ] proud of you </SPEAKER_03>
