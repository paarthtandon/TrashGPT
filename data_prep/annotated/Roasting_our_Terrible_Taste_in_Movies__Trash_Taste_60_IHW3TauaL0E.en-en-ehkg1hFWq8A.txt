<SPEAKER_02> - We live, baby! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Everybody, shut up! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> We're making art! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You enjoy this content right now! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that what you say
before you start recording? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Content, content! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I shouldn't even
notice what you're doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so weak. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're in a new studio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can shout, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can you give us an example of that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor yells) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (chill music plays) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hello, gamers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Welcome back to another episode
of the Trash Taste podcast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I am boy with boys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You guys know us by now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And we have a themed
episode, as you can tell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We've never done this- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - We've never done this before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, imagine this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what if we make a three by three, guys? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Never done that before, before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you heard of an episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that will not go on a tangent? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just kidding. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> We will go on tangents. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I think 'cause we're, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me and Garnt are planning to
go out to the UK for a bit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so we need to record a little
more episodes in advance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, our solution to do
that is themed episodes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so that we don't run out
of stuff to talk about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we don't want to run
out of stuff to talk about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like the three by three episodes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's just a good
excuse to talk about shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that maybe we're not gonna
ever tangent towards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's also just hilarious </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we kind of brought back
the three by three, like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't even know that was a thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> People haven't done it since like 2010. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> But anyway, we've done a couple
of three by three episodes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> in the past. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We did one on anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> We've done one on games, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I think this will
be the third one now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> We're gonna talk about movies! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Not anime movies though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Actual live action movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with real people.
- [Joey] With real people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I feel like we don't- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like how we have to fucking specify </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> we watch real movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, of course because
to some people it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, so nine Ghibli films? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Is that gonna be-" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly like I don't get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to talk about live action movies a lot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though I feel like
I've watched a hell of a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of live action movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But the biggest problem I had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when making this three by
three was I don't remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the fuck I've watched. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, we've been watching
movies God knows how long, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For like my entire life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's no like my movie list either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I feel like when you
got into anime specifically, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was probably at a point
where you really like cared </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> about it a lot, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, you made note of what you're watching. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You've been watching movies
your whole God damn life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's just what you do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, didn't you go through
like the IMDb top 200? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I went through it to remind myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, what have I seen? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Okay, I know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I like that, that one's good." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I literally had to go down that list </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to remind myself of what I've seen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so what, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what logic did you guys use to
choose your three by threes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so in my head, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I always have like a
top three movies ready. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause, you know, you're
always gonna be asked, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey, what's your favorite movies?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I always have like a top three, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but three by three you need nine movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm like, all right, shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> All right, I'll fill in the
rest of the six with like movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I thought were really good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I want to recommend to people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or movies that I know
I've seen multiple times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'll keep watching multiple times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mine were not recommendations at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was thinking maybe
I'll just make the ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where like the movies
I really, really like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just went through like my
list of movies I really liked, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just like too many fucking movies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I literally could not narrow it down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It needs to be like a fucking top 50 list. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen most of the IMDb top 200. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, this is not healthy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It would literally just
be like the IMDb top 200 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most of the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So like, I just went, fuck that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What are the movies that
I've just seen the most? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, if it's on TV, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I got time to watch this movie." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just picked movies that
made me think of something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Feel, feel things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Raw emotions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - A movie that gave me an experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, I feel that's- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause yeah, I feel like the
problem with that for me is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that too many movies do
that for me, so it's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're out here like fucking having </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an emotional breakdown
every movie you watch? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like movies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I like movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's really hard also to
like get rid of recency bias </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause like immediately I thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like the last 10 movies I watched, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, "Were they as
memorable as these other movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> "that I probably haven't
seen in like five, 10 years?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna say there's
some movies on my list </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that I haven't seen in fucking years, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I've put them on just because- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't wait to quiz you about movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that you haven't watched in years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like obsessed with them as a kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So some of those are on my list, so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What, do you got the
fucking Teletubbies movies? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> How far back we talking here, Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pretty far back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You'll see, you'll see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, let's see if our movie tastes are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> as pretentious as our anime tastes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But we're gonna decide
as always with Trash Box </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to see who goes first. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, get that out of here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that still in there from last time? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's in there from last time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Throw that out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was a scripted joke last time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and we just forgot we
put her in this time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - We forgot this time around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was a genuine bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> All right, who wants
to pick who goes first? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - All right, I'll go first. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hope it's not me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I really don't want to go first. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, thank God, it's Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Thank God, it's Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, fuck, I didn't want to go first. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bring up Garnt's three by three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] So, you're logic
for your three by three was- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is why I didn't want to go first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because I've got to
fucking defend this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, there are some
there where I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Genuinely good movies." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then there's a... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so this is split into two parts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just love how "Space Jam"
is in the fucking middle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like the fucking epicenter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is my movie! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - As a fucking kid, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like as a kid who grew up in the 90s, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone went through a
fucking "Space Jam" phase. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is a classic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a fucking classic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, as a kid, I didn't
watch the fucking NBA, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't even watch the
fucking "Looney Tunes." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And even as a kid, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking watched this so many times, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every time it was on TV, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I rewatched this shit so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Space Jam" is amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a good movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You sound like a kid trying to justify </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why you shit on the bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like to your parents. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you want to go through your list? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right, so, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, "Kung Fu Hustle." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] That's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] That's a good movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] That's a great movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] "Rush Hour 2." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yo, I fucking
love "Rush Hour 2!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] "Memento." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had a feeling you were
going to put "Memento" for some, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I don't know why, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I was that close to
putting "Memento" on my list, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm like, "I feel Garnt's
gonna put 'Memento' on." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] "Space jam." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] "The Matrix." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] First "Matrix," right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah, the first "Matrix." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "The 40-Year-Old Virgin." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> "Snatch," and "Confessions." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, this is very much split up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into my childhood obsession movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then some movies that
I just want people to watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and recommend them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why I've just
watched it so many times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, so before, we, I guess, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which movies have you seen, Joey, here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen all of them
except for "Kung Fu Hustle" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and "Confessions." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've not seen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Snatch" sounds so familiar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is "Snatch" the one where- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the one where he
fucking is like a boxer, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Snatch" is a Guy Ritchie movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a good movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think it's Guy Ritchie's
best movie like by far. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's that and "Lock, Stock." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about putting a Quentin
Tarantino movie on, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm surprised there is
no Quentin Tarantino movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I had a feeling someone
else was gonna put it on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So, that's why I put on "Snatch" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> instead of Quentin Tarantino </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Snatch" and like "Reservoir Dogs" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like my Quentin
Tarantino movie of choice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's kind of like, it's the
same kind of feel for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I feel like more people
know about Quentin Tarantino, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is why I wanted to put "Snatch" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is kind of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you want kind of a
British Quentin Tarantino </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of movie where it's
just got amazing dialogue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I love the concept of a
lot of different characters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that has nothing to do with each other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just kind of like merging
into one coherent storyline. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there's just bants. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The banter in this is so fucking good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I still quote this to this day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, so many of the
lines I "come up with" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just comes from "Snatch." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just got great writing,
great fucking humor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow, Gigguk literally
stealing from "Snatch" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I haven't seen "Confessions." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, me neither. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've never even heard of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Confessions" is
actually a Japanese movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey gasps) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Very fitting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know, and it's the one movie- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, Kokuhaku. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I've read the book. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I read the book, yes, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't know it was
even based on a book. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's probably my favorite
revenge movie of all time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's a Miyabe Miyuki book. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is it the one where it's
like set in high school? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - With like two girls? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Kind of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that's the one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, the concept of this movie is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the main character is a teacher. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And she used to teach, teach a class. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so these two students
from these class, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> or I think it was like
two or three students </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from this class, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they basically murder her daughter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But because of Japanese
laws, if you're like a minor, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then you can't be charged </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even if you've technically
like killed somebody. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is fucked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, which is fucked, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's like the whole
premise of this movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the premise of this movie is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> just her basically
playing fucking 5D chess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> against these high schoolers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just coming up with a very
unique like revenge scheme </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> against these kids. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's kinda like maybe
similar to "Old Boy" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you've seen "Old Boy," but maybe just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I've seen "Old Boy." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe just not as fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Old Boy" is pretty fucked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Old Boy" is pretty
fucked, and my problem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> with "Old Boy" is that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm surprised "Old Boy"
isn't on your three by three. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, my problem with "Old
Boy" is I really liked it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there are definitely
some parts of "Old Boy" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that really push your
suspension of disbelief. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, without spoiling, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like without spoiling the ending
of "Old Boy" or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's some plot elements
where you're just like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like the final twist? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like the final
twist where you're just- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've seen it?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The final twist where
you're just like, "I guess..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Can the human mind be
tricked into doing this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "That's like kind of pushing it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> What I like about
"Confessions" is that it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of like the same kind of deal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it's one person
getting revenge over people, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's just, it's kinda like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> she's kinda like a Light
Yagami kind of character </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's a very, it's a
very intricate revenge plot- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's believable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's believable, and it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it's believable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the whole premise
is fucked to begin with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because this is real, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, you know, Japanese
minors cannot be charged </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even if they kill somebody, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's like the premise of the movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But the way it unravels is
really, really interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And for a Japanese movie as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the biggest things I remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when watching this movie
for the first time is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that out of nowhere they
start playing Radiohead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hell yeah! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Is that fucking Radiohead
I'm listening to now?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And so Radiohead is- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Instant 10 out of 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And so like literally one of
the best parts of this movie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was just like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like the song for like the epic reveal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where she reveals everything,
it's just fucking Radiohead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "This is the best reveal
I've ever seen in a movie." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which Radiohead song is it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just remember the emotions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just remember the emotions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's not the most
famous Radiohead song. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, it's the one movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I think is like really underground </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause it's a Japanese movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And everyone who's
watched it so far has been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really, really fucking impressed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I don't see many people
talking about this movie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I feel like
Japanese cinema in general </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> just gets looked over a lot, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like 'cause they
tackle very Japanese things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> more often than not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, the way they go about
things is very Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and like kind of like doesn't really make, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> not that it doesn't make
sense, but just kind of odd. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, there's a lot of like
cultural elements and things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they throw back to that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where other people will be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, that doesn't happen in my school." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you have to kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just look past a lot of things I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you watch Japanese
movies as foreigners. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You can't relate to most of the stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause like I've
definitely read this book before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and I really, really enjoyed it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like back in like high school as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think this is quite an old book. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, I mean, for one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't even know that this
was like a movie, first of all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't even know it
was available in English. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause like a lot of Japanese
cinema doesn't make it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> outside of Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's always just translations online. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just wasn't expecting this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like I recommend a lot
of movies from this director. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember his name, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but "Confessions" is my favorite one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it on the poster? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Memories of Matsuko" is another movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that this director made that
is like really underground </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> even for like Japanese cinema,
but it's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But yeah, just like if
you're gonna take anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> out of my three by three,
watch "Confessions" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because more people need to
know about "Confessions." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Kokuhaku. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's an amazing movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's one of the few Japanese movies </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that I think is just easily
accessible to like anyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't really need to
know about Japanese culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just a good revenge plot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And if you like "Old Boy" or, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of Korean movies, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're probably gonna like "Confessions." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, Miyabe Miyuki I
think is the original woman </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who wrote Kokuhaku. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, all of her books kind of like deal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> with this kind of like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's kind of like criticizing
fucked up parts of Japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like using it as like an advantage. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] I'm down for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's really good, the book- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] That sounds really good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Might actually watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The best movie on there is
"The 40-Year-Old Virgin." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, I think... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I wanted to put a comedy movie on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was thinking what comedy
movie can I infinitely rewatch? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've got like three on there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] You've got "Scott
Pilgrim vs. the World." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Space Jam," "Rush Hour 2."
- [Garnt] Is that a comedy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] "Scott Pilgrim" is a comedy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Scott Pilgrim" is a comedy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt sighs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess it's like a- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a fucking comedy.
- It's a comedy! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's nonstop jokes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is the best with visual comedy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, okay, it is definitely
a, it's a comedy movie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's not just got a comedy
in it because I love, I mean- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Neither is "40-Year-Old Virgin." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's quite a story of a man
coming to lose his virginity. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of course, it's a great
coming of age story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, coming of 40-year-old age. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was thinking like what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I feel like
recently comedy movies have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of just died. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if that's the thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's, what's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I mean, you know, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like the fucking
Will Ferrell movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and modern Adam Sandler films,
outside of "Uncut Gems," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have just fucking made it go to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it's literally only it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But also the Adam Sandler
movies do extremely well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> on Netflix. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're some of the most
watched things on Netflix. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> The ones that they bought off- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think I've seen
an Adam Sandler movie since- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause they're all so
mediocre, his new ones. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the only one that he was amazing in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> which was, "Uncut Gems" is
absolutely fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It wasn't even his movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> He was just, he's the main actor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've heard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that a comedy movie
or is that just a movie? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, it's a pretty brutal movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Really fucking good though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - All I've seen from that
is the clip when he goes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh my God, I'm gonna cum!" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's pretty much all
I've seen of that movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need to watch this movie now! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What is going on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Adam Sandler, what is happening right now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly it's a fucking amazing movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I need to watch this movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so fucking good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Uncut Gems," please
watch it if you haven't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's his best role. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, "40-Year-Old Virgin" is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me the infinitely
rewatchable comedy movie for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That used to play on British television, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think like once a fucking week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that's why I've
watched it so many times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everyone in the UK has watched it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it use to play
all the fucking time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is also one of those movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that never leaves the airplane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, it's always playing.
- Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, if you look up
movies on an airplane, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like "the old classics"
genre, it's always in there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's so many famous
scenes in that movie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like the fucking tit scene </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they talk about feeling a boob. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - "It's like a sandbag." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the fucking waxing scene as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's iconic, it's iconic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I feel like this gets
talked about less than maybe, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like at least when it first
came out, because the iconic- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was that one if his like most famous, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like was that one of the
roles that blew him up? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - This one was when I first
started to know Steve Carell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I didn't know about him before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because I think before that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the only thing I've seen him
in was like "Bruce Almighty." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But he had like one
iconic scene out of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - He wasn't the main character, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - He wasn't the main character. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, it was Jim Carrey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I feel like this was his first movie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> where I was just like,
"Damn, this guy's funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is a funny fucking movie." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, I remember back when this came out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the iconic comedy movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when this first came out was "Superbad." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Classic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like 2000s humor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like those movies were all the rage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everyone was quoting "Superbad," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I kind of think 'The
40-Year-Old Virgin' is funnier." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That was just (laughs)
that was just me back then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought "Superbad" was
funny for like two months. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nah, nah, when you were in high school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Superbad" is like the funniest shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, you're just going to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When you've heard of like the, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, 1,000th McLovin'
joke, you're just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "All right, yeah, I get it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I get." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's kind of same with "Borat," right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I should've put "Borat" on mine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Actually, it's so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, Sydney had never
seen "Borat" before. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, she watched "Borat"
for the first time in 2021 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about like a month ago. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, me, someone who's
like been quoting "Borat" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> throughout my entire high school,
it's been quoted to death. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's hard to find it funny anymore </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's just been
like, everyone's just- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's so ingrained. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's so ingrained that I just cease </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to find it funny anymore. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> She still found it fucking hilarious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It is legitimately hilarious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is really funny, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like, when I watched that
movie, all I think is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> "God damn, he's such a
fucking amazing actor." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's no movie that
even comes close to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that kind of experience,
like, of what he does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Admittedly, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like I can probably
quote most of that movie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'd be lying if I said
every time I heard Borat go, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "My wife," like, I'm like,
that's just hilarious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause Borat said, "My wife," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and Sydney just fucking lost it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "Oh shit,
this was funny at a point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I forgot this was legitimately funny." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The genius of fucking
"Borat" was that it made you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on a service level you think that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, this is just hee hee
funny movie," making fun of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was really just a
really fucking intelligent way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of showing how racist America is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that's how good, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the best part was is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that those people were the ones quoting it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after the movie came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's like a genius way of showing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a way that, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he made a, he showed, like, how, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like, I guess there was like
a racist problems in America </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> before it was like talked
about wildly today. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And still it was massively
marketed towards the audience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that often didn't even know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that that's what he was poking fun at. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's genius. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, that's what I
fucking loved about Ali G </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> back in the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, that's a name
I haven't heard in so long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - He has a movie as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God, like the
first time I watched that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like, I thought everything was scripted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like a lot of it is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like some of the interview
scenes and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's all non-scripted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, how the fuck does he do that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's just a genius at like
being able to turn a situation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and like make them look
stupid without having </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to like make them think that
he's playing a character. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> He's so good at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, he is actually
like a social genius. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> He knows how to work people so well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the thing is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> he gets so invested in this character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's actually insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It must be a nightmare
being married to him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Which character are
you tonight, honey?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, 'cause I remember
like re-watching "Borat" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with Sydney, there was this
one scene where he gets drunk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with a bunch of American frat boys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And at first I was like,
"There's no way this is real. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This must be scripted." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so we looked into it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's totally real to the point- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He got drunk with them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, to the point where
he got like blackout drunk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with them and just was able to stay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> in character this entire fucking time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's fucking dedication, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, I think by the time he
goes to do these characters, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so fucking baked in his
head that he's this character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that he doesn't even think,
"Oh, I'm doing an act." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's just him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He just thinks this
is me which is insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's such an insane- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe you should have
put "Borat" on yours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't put "Borat" on mine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wish I did though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just like the whole, I just
find it all so fascinating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And like "What is America"
is so fucking funny as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, oh, he's just so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, he's very, very good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Absolute fucking genius. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So aside from that, I guess, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what else haven't you seen Joey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen everything, oh,
"Kung Fu Hustle" I haven't seen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Kung Fu Hustle,"
fucking, that's, that's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] It's a good movie? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a fucking banger. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it looks
fucking awesome already. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me it's like one of the
closest you could possibly get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to real life anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's somehow wacky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a wacky live action
kind of slapstick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, what it does is that it does, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to parody martial arts movies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just makes a martial arts
movie that is just an anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> All the characters are
like, "I have this power." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they do like all
weird fucking spells and shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So, like the premise
of this movie is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like this like ax
gang, this very famous gang, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and for some reason they invade this very, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> very small village that nobody's heard of. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's just like this secret village </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where coincidentally a lot
of martial arts masters have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like all situated in this one city. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I love it already. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So, what happens is firstly, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they find three martial arts masters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who just happen to live in this city. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They didn't know they lived in this city. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, one person was just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think like a barber or something or... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's been so long since I've watched it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's been so long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] The noodle store owner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, one was the noodle store guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] The tailor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, the tailor, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] One was, like, the laborer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Damn, you remember the story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You remember this better than me, Ashley. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Were you in the movie? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And so after they find out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> these three martial arts
masters are in this village, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were like, "Well,
we got to send assassins </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "to assassinate them." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, they send assassins </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to like get rid of these
three martial arts masters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it turns out that
there are even more, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> higher up martial arts
masters just living in there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a pyramid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hierarchy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hierarchy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pyramid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so like they just find
out like more OP people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just keep fucking invading this village </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like more OP heroes
just keep coming out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of the woodworks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fucking great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, it's just
literally just escalation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's such a fun movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why have I not heard of this movie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really, if you
watch martial arts movies- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which I used to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You'll know about this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the thing, during high school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had like a massive like spree </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of just watching every Bruce
Lee and Jackie Chan movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like all the martial
arts movies I could think of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Same here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I never heard of
this one for some reason. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, I feel
like if you did go through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that martial arts phase, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like one of the peak of just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it knows the genre so well that
it kind of parodies itself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But at the same time
takes itself 100% serious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just one of the best- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'd argue that's the best kind of movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It does everything well
for a martial arts movie, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that's why I love it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's got the wacky fights, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's got like the really
well choreographed fights </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But speaking of martial arts fights </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that defines my childhood, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Rush Hour." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Speaking of Jackie Chan,
there he is right there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What can you say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wish there was more "Rush Hour." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I need the dynamics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really think that the "Rush
Hour" series was what got me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into the whole martial
arts genre to begin with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, honestly, maybe same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> My friend showed me it when
I was like really young, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just fucking fell in love with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean, it's like Jackie Chan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Chris Tucker is a dynamic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that on paper should never work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They should never have the
chemistry that they do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they have such good chemistry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the amount of times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've rewatched "Rush Hour" one and two, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially in my childhood,
was just like uncountable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I actually don't know how
many times I've rewatched it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it like defined like a good, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> five-year period of my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that was what
started my martial arts phase </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I just watched so many
different martial arts movies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's 'cause of "Rush Hour." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jackie Chan is very, very funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's one of the most charismatic actors. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like in that that's
carried by Jackie Chan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like how good he is at playing like dumb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So good in this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Him playing off Chris
Tucker, it's just, it's just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Chris Tucker's just Chris Tucker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then Jackie Chan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's just funny by himself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And Jackie Chan is also
like funny by himself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like a completely different reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like completely clash of styles. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like I remember when I was doing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> doing, not the anime awards, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the Trash Taste awards. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When I was doing the "I
have a dream" speech. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> People were just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> "Wow, Garnt's really
parodying Martin Luther King </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "really well." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, I actually
just took that speech </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> from "Rush Hour 2" when
Chris Tucker did it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> at the casino scene. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - All of your fucking
jokes and everything come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from fucking movies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everything you hear on
Gigguk is just movie quotes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, this is the secret coming out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> When I'm just like, these
are the movies I've rewatched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so many times that they're
just ingrained in my mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was "Rush Hour 2" the best one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What was the plot of "Rush
Hour 2," is that the Paris one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that was "Rush Hour 3." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was, that (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Rush Hour-" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love he just immediately knows this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> He's like, "Yeah, that's 'Rush Hour 3.'" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't remember a
distinction between any of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> They're all just one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All of the "Rush Hours"
kind of just blend together </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I remember "Rush Hour
1" and "2" were the good ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was "3" bad? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think "3" was bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think "3" was average. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - "3" was kind of like the contested one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, Jackie Chan was
getting like a little bit old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when "Rush Hour 3" happened, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so like you could tell that he couldn't do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> as many stunts as he could do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Rush Hour 1" and "2" I feel
like was Jackie Chan more, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, he could get away with more things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He was in his prime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't feel it was his prime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was definitely closer to his prime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The back end of his prime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think his prime was in like 1990. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, I remember, I don't know why, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I remember as a kid, I
slightly preferred "Rush Hour 2." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that was the
slightly better movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I mean, "Rush Hour 1"
is still fucking brilliant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] I mean, can we also
just talk about the fact </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I fully expected you to put "Memento" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> in your three by three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It just seems like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have I ever talked about it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it just seems like a Garnt movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can picture the Gigguk video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Guys, what if I told
you you could go back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "and get pictures or something?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just, I feel like I would
hear, I would hear like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How is that my Gigguk video? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like I can see you
making a video about "Memento" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> even though you never, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it just feels like a Gigguk- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, if I can imagine anyone
making a "Memento" video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's either you or John. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It just seems like the kind
of thing you would talk about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like a very like artsy film. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, it's a really good film. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it an artsy film? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think it's an artsy film. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a bit artsy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like Christopher Nolan
being Christopher Nolan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> being like, "I have 500 IQ. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> "Watch me try to present
my 500 IQ on film." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's just like, "Memento"
is one of the few, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> films I think he's made that actually, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it was just like, "Oh,
Nolan, that was pretty smart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I gotta give you-" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, "Memento" actually
was written by his brother. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it's based off
like a four page novella </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> written by Jonathan Nolan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Christopher was like,
"You have four pages? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "Let me turn that into 400
and get Guy Pearce in it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because I remember this
was one of his first movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they actually, I think this was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know it was based on a novella </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I know that they made
a short film around this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I've actually seen,
and that's also really good, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and they expanded on this idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just like Nolan with no budget. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, but still doing the
same kind of Nolan ideas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, before he had a budget and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like "Tenet." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's "Tenet" without a budget. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then "Tenet" happens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then he forgot that he
had to write like characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and a plot, and just like (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go along with the cool
ideas he had in his head. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, I feel like
this and "Inception," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, "Inception"
has been memed the fuck </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to like hell and back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> But I remember the first
time I saw "Inception," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought it was fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, of course, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, like I will
always give Nolan the chance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just because his peak- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He always does something interesting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, he always, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if he doesn't make the best movie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> he always has interesting ideas </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he always tries something new, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is what I can respect. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Not everything hits the
mark, but it's Nolan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> You can expect that he's not
gonna stay in his comfort zone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, "Memento" is
definitely one of those movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that like, well, A, you
have to watch more than once </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to fully understand it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but B, even after multiple watches, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like, "I don't get it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So to explain "Memento" to
anyone who hasn't seen it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is, yeah, it's gonna sound so weird, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's a movie that
plays in reverse kind of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Kind of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because it's about this guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who has a condition that gives
him short-term memory loss. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So, he can only remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> at most like five minutes at a time? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What a horrible existence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's someone like that in
real life, I think actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, this is
an actual real condition </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that exists. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Love how they made it into a real thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, you can't believe it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God, I can't believe
you have the same condition </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> as that guy from "Memento." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But so because of this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're only presented like
five minutes of this movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at a time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's a movie that plays in reverse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's about this guy
who has this condition </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and is trying to get
revenge for the person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who murdered his wife, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which, you know, it's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Combine a five minute memory, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a five minute short term memory </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with a long-term revenge plot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Things are... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Things are about to get confusing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Things are gonna get confusing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially for the main character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have I watched this movie? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's the one where, like,
every time he comes to again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> he looks at his body </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> because he tattoos all of
his memories onto his body. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I've heard so
much about this movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that I think I've seen it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I don't actually
think I've ever seen it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think I have actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's very good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I know the plot
and I know what happens. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone knows the plot to this movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone talks about it.
- You know what happens? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, you know the twist, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I believe I do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, we're not gonna say it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't wanna know
just in case I'm wrong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But I think I know what the twist is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But like, I just remember the first time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I watched this movie and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Damn, this is legit,
like, really clever." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> 500 IQ meme aside, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't have to have a
high IQ to enjoy this movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a very well-made movie
for such a confusing concept. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because at the beginning
you were just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how am I supposed to follow along </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when the movie is playing in backwards? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> How am I supposed to, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> how is anything supposed
to be surprising to me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And he finds a way to keep it interesting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> throughout the entire run of the movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the ending kind of
just like slaps you in the face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're like, "Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh shit, I did not
see that coming, okay." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then this kind of launched his career, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I feel like this is
one of his best works. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I agree with that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow, thank you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Thank you for that talk, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> Thank you very much to
Punishing Gray Raven </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for sponsoring us today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I definitely need to
watch "Kung Fu Hustle" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and "Confessions." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you watched "Scott Pilgrim?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I liked "Scott Pilgrim." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really like "Scott Pilgrim." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a good movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it's a good movie? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a good movie? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's a really good movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I'm a huge fan of Edgar Wright. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Edgar Wright's the other
director where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Whatever you make,
I'll fucking watch it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Edgar Wright is like the
master of visual comedy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where like, he manages
to cut something in a way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or just like edit something in a way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that just makes it like,
"Whoa, I wasn't expecting that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "But that's hilarious." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's just, he's
one of the few people who, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever genre he takes on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he'll put his own spin on the genre. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it's so rare to find someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> who you can just watch a movie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you can just tell it's Edgar Wright </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> through the editing itself
because it's such a- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - The snappiness of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just like the unique and
the snappiness and the like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's very rhythmic, isn't it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is this your favorite Edgar Wright film? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think mine is still
"Shaun of the Dead." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was debating putting
"Shaun of the Dead" on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hot Fuzz," I like "Hot Fuzz." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a great movie, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Hot Fuzz" is good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just feel like the first half was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a little bit boring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why I don't think it's as strong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as a "Shaun of the Dead." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And "Scott Pilgrim" I feel like is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most Edgar Wright
film there is because- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel "Scott Pilgrim" couldn't be made </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> by any other director. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel "Shaun of the Dead," Sean Penn... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that his name? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, Sean Penn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sean Penn and Nick... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cannon? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was about to say Nick Fury, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then I was like, wait, that's not- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] You're thinking of Nick Frost. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nick Frost, that's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Nick Frost. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] You also said
Sean Penn not Simon Pegg. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I said Sean Penn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no, Sean Penn is the
one that dies every movie! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was wondering who you were talking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I don't think he's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm trying to think
like when you said that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, Sean Penn is not the
one that dies in every movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, Sean Penn is
the one that always dies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in every movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] No, that's Sean Bean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, that's Sean Bean.
- Oh, that's Sean Bean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why is there so many Seans? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sean Penn is... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Who's Sean Penn? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] He was married to Robin Wright. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who the fuck is that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We got a fucking living
IMDb page right here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] She played Kevin Spacey's wife </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in "House of Cards." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I haven't seen "House of Cards." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen "House of Cards." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, but going back to "Scott Pilgrim," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the reason I put this on is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause like I do really, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> really fucking like "Shaun of the Dead." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I feel like "Scott Pilgrim" is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just the most Edgar Wright
movie to exist at the moment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's him on like his best form. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this movie kind of, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like defined a
whole generation of nerds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you've seen so many people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who just base their
entire fucking personality </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on this one movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know who you are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You know who you fucking are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you meet that person at like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you meet one person like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at like every anime convention you go to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Of course, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I mean, I think the
reason why it works so well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is because like again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Edgar Wright's like way
of directing is very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like over-exaggerated and like
very not rooted in reality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that works perfectly
with "Scott Pilgrim" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause "Scott Pilgrim" is based
off of fucking comic books. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's very comicy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was this the first Edgar
Wright film you watched? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, "Shaun of the Dead." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I literally watched his movies like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the beginning, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I watched "Spaced"
before "Shaun of the Dead." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm like, I've known of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like a very, very long time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think most people
in our age group started </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with "Shaun of the Dead," right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I really like "Hot Fuzz." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Hot Fuzz" is really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it's a really good film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's maybe my favorite. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like it's, out of
like the Cornetto trilogy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like the middle favorite for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like "Shaun of the Dead, "Hot Fuzz," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then I can't remember the third one then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] "The World's End." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "World's End," that's it! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I also, I think "Hot
Fuzz" is like where I grew up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> those kinds of towns. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, "Oh shit, that is real." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's very much like if
you're not like familiar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with British, like, comedy- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's literally like they ripped my town. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I know they didn't but
it's very much similar to- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like that was the
vibe they were going for. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why "Hot Fuzz" like
barely made it big in the US </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of the references
Americans don't get. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I feel like "Shaun of the Dead" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and "Hot Fuzz' were both
very much cult hits. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because they're very much
ingrained in British humor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and British culture, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> You watch "Hot Fuzz" and
you probably can get a vibe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of what the place like he
grew up in, which is like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nothing bad happens here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like not something you can say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for many other British films even. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean people, when
people think British films </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or British culture, they're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, it's like 'Harry Potter,' right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Everything's like 'Harry
Potter' over there." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everyone's just wizarding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but I think another thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's been lost through time was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just how fucking unpopular this was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when this first came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Because now it's just like nerd culture. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Ha ha mainstream nerd culture. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Hi, I'm a nerd guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I identify as a nerd. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> But I remember when I
first saw this in theaters, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I saw this by myself in a
completely empty theater </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in Brighton. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow, really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because nobody wanted
to see this fucking movie! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it a marketing issue? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Huh? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it a marketing issue? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe the nerds just didn't
want to expose themselves. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Except for Garnt who's
like, "Fuck you, dude." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Normally, it's normally
a marketing issue, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> especially if it's a good movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, this movie fucking
bombed in the cinemas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It was only afterwards- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Definitely a cult. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It definitely became a
cult movie that got picked up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and more people watched </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as like nerd culture
became more mainstream. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I remember the first
time watching this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it blew my fucking mind how good this was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I couldn't tell anyone about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause nobody was
interested in watching it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just tell them to watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do I sell this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> How would you sell this to someone? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, go back 20 years. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> How do you sell this to someone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to like one of your mates or something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just tell them it's really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You wanna watch it again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - "So what's it like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What's it like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Tell me." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "I'll just take you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Just shut up." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Shut up and I'll take you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Don't expect anything." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Buy some popcorn and have a good time." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Is it like the fooey?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, fuck off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Space Jam," you already
mentioned that you grew up with it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and whatnot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> What about "Matrix" there? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "The Matrix," I mean... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you really feel that
strongly about "The Matrix?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly as a kid, yeah, I did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As a kid, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like it's one of those things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I just care about
it as like referential. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it's so famous and so referenced. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But now I don't really give
a shit about "The Matrix." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I didn't really give a- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was revolutionary when it came out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like, "Whoa, you can do that?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm also biased. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That fucking scene
where they put the thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> inside of the stomach gave
me nightmares as a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've already talked about that, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That fucking gave me nightmares. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I will say, I don't think "The
Matrix" has aged very well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh no, definitely not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Especially the first one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've definitely rewatched
it and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh God, I thought this was really cool." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought this was like the
coolest thing when it came out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause that's why- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's kind of shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kind of shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It definitely hasn't aged well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It definitely has not aged well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But that's because there's
been since "The Matrix," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's been a million "Matrix" clones </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that are just shot better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I mean, like I feel like
part of the big reason I got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into anime was because
of "The Matrix' as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I'm just like, I see this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then this was like my
anime taste for a long time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I thought this was cool as shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I wanted to find
more things like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just iconic as fuck really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's iconic as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember, I think
the first time I saw this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when did this come out? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 1999? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - '97, I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, I think I was like nine or 10 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I first saw this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Way too young to be seeing this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I remember thinking this
was like the coolest thing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which it was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - For the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, for the time, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - For the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Showing your age there, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When he like pulls the red
and blue pill, it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Which one is he gonna pick?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thinK by my age </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was old enough to
be able to appreciate it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it'd kind of fallen out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, definitely because- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was like, what, like 16? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So that was like eight years ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - At that time, right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> there'd already been a
million clones of "Matrix." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - By the time that came out for you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people who would dress like the people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in "The Matrix" are like
neckbeards holding a katana </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like a fedora, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If "The Matrix" was made nowadays, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like the person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who's just learned the way of the blade. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't really watch many, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> nerd movies though growing up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I never watched- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What defines a nerd movie? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, what defines nerd movie? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Star Wars." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've still yet to watch the
original "Star Wars" trilogy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Or like "Lord of the Rings"
or anything like that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love "Lord of the Rings." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, that's probably
the nerdiest of nerd- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I haven't watched "Lord of the Rings." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You haven't watched "Lord of the Rings?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, what's weirder, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> not watching "Star Wars"
or "Lord of the Rings?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You haven't watched "Star Wars?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, you're both fucking weird to me! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You haven't watched "Star Wars," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you haven't watch "Lord of the Rings." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like you have to
watch "Lord of the Rings." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like you have
to watch "Star Wars" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in that sense then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, you don't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't have to, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't have to watch
one, two, and three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just at least four, five, six. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I've only watched
one, two, and three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't count that as
watching "Star Wars." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've not watched the original trilogy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You have to watch the original trilogy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you sat through 12
hours of "Lord of the Rings," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you can sit through
three "Star Wars" movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I used to watch like the director's cut </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of "Lord of the Ring" back to back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like 15 hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Back when we used to car journey, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we used to go to France every holiday. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a 12 hour journey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like longer than 12. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> So, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Great, I'll watch the 'Lord
of the Rings' director cuts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "back to back in one sitting." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I used to do that like on the
way there and on the way back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like "Lord of the Rings," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but that's too much "Lord
of the Rings" for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly the reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I haven't watched "Lord of the Rings" is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> okay, I have watched the first movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Fell asleep, thought it was
boring, never came back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How old were you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - When did it come out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The first one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "Fellowship of the Ring" came
out in like mid-2000s, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, wait. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like 2003 or something, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, I remember my cousin
watching it, and he was like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] 'O1. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - '01. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Holy shit, that's a 20-year-old movie? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sheesh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, I think was about like 13, 14 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when I attempted to watch
it, and I don't know, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like the prime time though! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is gonna sound weird
like coming from the isekai guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just don't find fantasy
all that interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's all you fucking talk about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's all you talk about! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Watch it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You like fantasy now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bring back Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> This is not Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go back and watch it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Anime fantasy, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking fuck with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Real life fantasy, get
this shit out of my face. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, what a weeb. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> What a fucking weeb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro, go watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Actually give it a shot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "If it doesn't have hot anime
titties in an isekai world, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I don't want it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I appreciate the honesty. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is the main character overpowered? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No, Frodo's like, Frodo can't do shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why it's so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why it's good because he fights </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> through all of these
like insanely impossible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to survive situations with
the power of friendship, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every single movie has
just amazing scenes in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude, Sam, best waifu. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just saying right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> He's best waifu, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He supPorts Frodo from start to finish. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's your favorite "Lord
of the Rings" movie, Joey? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably third one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - See, this is what I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can say any one of those
movies is the best movie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, "That's totally fair." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, every single movie is great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, all three movies are fantastic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> You gotta watch it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, maybe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - We should watch it together. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's long though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's long. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We don't have to watch
the director's cut and shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We can watch the normal ones,
which is still like 10 hours, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but still. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The director's cut can
only really be appreciated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> after you've loved the first cut </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because they didn't want the bonus stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You need to make sure you love it first. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, I'm sitting you down
to watch "Lord of the Rings," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sitting you down to watch "Star Wars." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think you do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't feel like
"Star Wars" is necessary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, I'm... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, I've pissed off
"Lord of the Rings" fans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me piss off "Star Wars" fans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Say it, Garnt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I prefer the prequels. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Ashley] What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never just silenced a room so fast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was the loudest one
second silence I ever heard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know the plot to the original trilogy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and like Darth Vader. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I just think Darth Vader
looks fucking boring. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I've played the Lego
games, so I know the story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - "So, I basically know 'Star Wars' guys." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know the story and I just think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that like Darth Maul, fucking bad ass. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, to be fair- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - General Grievous, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> only the coolest- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Count Dooku? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Count Dooku's meh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> General Grievous is the coolest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking "Star Wars" character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - To be fair, to be fair- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jar Jar Binks, amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - If we're gonna say our hot
takes on like "Star Wars," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just gonna say it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I think "Episode I" is
actually really fucking good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think, well, obviously,
because I prefer the prequels. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Darth Maul fight and the podracing is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like the two greatest
scenes in "Star Wars." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, because the
reason I prefer the prequels, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to defend myself is, okay, number one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I really don't give a
shit about "Star Wars." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I couldn't care less about "Star Wars." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] That's fair. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just not something
I'm interested in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not passionate
about "Star Wars" either. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Lego games are just bangers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - True. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's just like, I remember watching, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've actually seen the
original trilogy a lot of times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because someone's always
got it on in the background. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Someone's always watching
it at some fucking family, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> family gathering or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or it's like playing at Christmas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But someone's always watching it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so I've seen it so many fucking times. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I kind of find it like just boring. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just a very standard
movie with like, it's just... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's original about
"Star Wars" nowadays? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, nowadays it's not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because again very much like "Matrix" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just been copied to shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's kind of just
like "The Matrix" to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's just, to me
it's just boring now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just a very normal standard movie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just like, yeah,
Luke goes on a hero's journey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and Darth Vader is the
villain and yada yada yada. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why I never like cared </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to watch episodes seven, eight and nine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because in my mind, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not really like a fantasy to- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is nine out? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Ashley] It's been out since what... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - See, I don't even know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Didn't people like
hate the last two movies? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think so, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Episode VII" was the only
one were people were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "It was pretty good." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but like, to me,
there are so many like scenes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the prequels that just stand out to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, that fucking duel with Darth Maul </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like fucking Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Holy shit! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> That is iconic! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That fight to this day
still is the best fight scene </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in "Star Wars" and it has the best theme. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The Darth Maul theme, dude! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Darth Maul was terrifying as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Darth Maul was fucking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck the Darth Vader theme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck Darth Vader. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> What's scary about someone having asthma? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, fucking... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I have asthma. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Does that make me fucking scary? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, fuck that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also in the prequels, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we didn't get to see Anakin kill the kids. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like that part. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, the first time you see, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Count Dooku fight Yoda, holy shit, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That was, to me, that was like
by far the one "Star Wars-" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The only thing that irks me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> about the original three episodes is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yoda is literally a puppet.
- General Grievous wasn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in all of them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yoda is literally a puppet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - People love that though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't get that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I prefer when he's like, you
know, has emotion in his face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I liked him when he was fucking shit up! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, when he was like
flipping in the air and shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When he brings out the lightsaber </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and he starts doing
fucking like gymnastics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and all this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Also I love Samuel L. Jackson though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, Samuel L. Jackson. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Samuel L. Jackson is the only thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that made "The Clone Wars" bearable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When he pulls out the purple lightsaber, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "My man! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Let's go!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the coolest, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the only thing I actually gave a shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about "Star Wars" was the jedis, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and what's not in the fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like what's hardly in the original trilogy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like the sequels? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the jedis! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to see cool jedis fights. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to see cool lightsaber fights. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also all the best memes
come from the prequels. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It did get memed to shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, I'm sticking by my gun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I prefer the "Star Wars" prequels. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Come at me "Star Wars" fans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wonder how many dislikes
this clip's gonna have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Star Wars" is kind of boring. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fair. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not gonna sit here and pretend </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's the greatest
fantasy story ever written. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I mean, you know, it's dece. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, that's the biggest thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm more passionate about
not caring about "Star Wars" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like "Lord of the
Rings" I've seen some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like the action scenes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, I could
probably get into it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's just- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, the battles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bruh! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The battles are fucking everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Battle of Helm's Deep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Bro! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Got me acting up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - So good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Battles are so good! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Lord of the Rings"
battles make me act up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yo, we still haven't had battles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as good as "Lord of the Rings." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's been like 20 years
and nothing has come close. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude, give me another hour
and a half long fight scene, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> man, I need that in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's insane, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That guy literally pitched
that and they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, let's do it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - "So you want the fight
scene to be how long?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they fucking did it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They did it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's an hour and a half battle scene. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's fucking amazing.
- That doesn't cut away </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's literally an hour
and a half of fighting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right, I guess you sold me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess that's all I need. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - They still build character
and story in a battle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> without like bullshit disbelief of, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "What's going on? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Is everything okay?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like literally they're
like in the middle of fucking- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're literally monologuing
as they're fighting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> why I stopped watching "Lord
of the Rings" (laughs) 'cause, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I was actually
watching it with my cousin. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so they go on this
journey and I kept asking, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> "Are they there yet?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he literally got so
fucking pissed off with me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I was just like,
"Are they there yet? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "When are they gonna get there? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Are they close to coming there?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's like, "Garnt, shut the fuck up!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You also can't watch "Lord of the Rings" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with someone who is a giga fan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You need someone to shut the
fuck up when you're watching. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's my pet peeve. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Please, please- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - People who love "Lord of the Rings," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> unfortunately will tell you everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about "Lord of the Rings"
throughout every single moment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, please don't be that guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who just quotes the movie as it happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I literally can't stand it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is my least favorite thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like what's even
worse is like not even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they're quoting out loud, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> when they think they're
being conspicuous about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they just like start
mouthing to themselves. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, the one I hate more is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> when they whisper to themselves
right before it happens. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I get it, you've seen
this movie 17,000 times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Shut the fuck up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I hate when people are
like, "Oh, this part's good." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, well, I'll decide that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't tell me this part's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm about to fucking watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll decide if this part is good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't be that guy please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I've... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> You know, you always have that part </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where you show someone
a movie you really like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I try to be as
subtle about it as I can. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because like, in my mind, I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "This good part's coming up." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'll like try to like
see on the corner of my eye </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> if they're watching it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, if I was invisible,
I'd be like full on Elmo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't look at me like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the other pet peeve I have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'm showing a movie
to a friend or whoever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and in my head, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, this next scene, they're gonna love." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I look over and they're
just out on their phone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't be that guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, don't be that guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Etiquette, come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Movie etiquette. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But anyway, that's my three by three. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> These are not my favorite films, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> well some of these I fuck with still. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Some of these are just
there because (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I mean, they're
your childhood movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're my childhood movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what three by three's all about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This episode is sponsored by us! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Trash Taste! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We have mugs now! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Trash Taste Mug! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Mugs! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - On a scale of one to 10, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> how much do you want to
drink tea out of this mug? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 10 out of 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It comes with its own lid
to keep beverages warm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, the lid comes off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What?
- Not only is this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a collector's item, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, look at this thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> This would look amazing on your shelf. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's also highly practical. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a good size mug. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look at this. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> - Joey is next. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I swear I'm always last, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why is that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> All right, well, hopefully
mine won't be too pretentious. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is mine pretentious? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - At first I saw "Apocalypse
Now" and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> did you just go through the IMDb top 250? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so I'll go through them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So, from top left to bottom
right we have "King's Speech," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Rashomon," "Bruce Almighty," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Apocalypse Now," "Pulp Fiction," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Goodfellas," "Austin Powers Goldmember," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Gladiator," and "Kamera o Tomeru na." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I've seen every
English speaking movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had a feeling you'd put Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are these Japanese movies? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are these Nihongo movies? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I say that as I put one on mine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so which ones have
you guys seen and not seen? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - All of these except for, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think I've seen "Apocalypse Now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, you've never seen "Apocalypse Now?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Actually I haven't seen
"Apocalypse Now" either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] What?
- The two Japanese films. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so like as I was saying earlier, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I always have that
like top three movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in case anyone at like
a panel always asks me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And my top three that I always
bring up is "Apocalypse Now," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Pulp Fiction," and "Goodfellas." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, those are all
fucking bangers, honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, this is top 10 IMDb films. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't even know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like "Goodfellas"
and "Pulp Fiction" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely are like top 20. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, "Goodfellas"
and "Pulp Fiction" are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> definitely up there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never, wait, no, I
haven't watched "Goodfellas." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, you've never seen "Goodfellas?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've never watched "The
Godfather" or "Goodfellas." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Oh really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, have you not? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know how you said like
sometimes you just save a movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that you just know you're gonna love? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, you know, I don't
need to watch it right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I know I will and
I know I'll enjoy it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, like, I feel like
if we're going through like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that IMDb thing, like
most people are like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh yeah, 'Godfather.'" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, the "Godfather" trilogy, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's definitely one of those. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like, the
"Godfather" trilogy is good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and like, I like a lot
of Martin Scorsese films. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think out of all
of them, "Goodfellas," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a tie for me between
"Goodfellas" and "Casino." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I feel like
"Casino" is so underrated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, "Casino" I feel is a very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> underrated Martin Scorsese film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I put "Goodfellas"
there because it was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the classic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the classic, it
was the first, like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Safe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Safe is what I'm seeing here, Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was the first Martin
Scorsese like gangster film </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I ever watched. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then obviously I went
back after that and was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll watch "Godfather" and "Taxi
Driver" and like all those. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the thing about
"Godfather" is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I obviously recognize it as a good movie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but there's a difference
between me being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, this is a really good
movie" to "This is a movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "that I really personally enjoy." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And for me, "Godfather" is like something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I could recognize as really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just a bit slow sometimes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like Martin
Scorsese gangster films is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just "Godfather" but just
a bit more condensed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a bit more snappy, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Martin Scorsese did "The Departed?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, he did "Departed" as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that's probably one of my favorite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a fantastic film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, again, everything he's made, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like "Wolf of Wall Street"
as well was fantastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Martin Scorsese is just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's just a really,
really good filmmaker. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Consistent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Raging Bull" as well was another one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically every movie you can think of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that has Robert De Niro in
it, probably a Scorsese film. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like one of the best duos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you see them together </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know it's gonna be a banger film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The part that killed me
though was like, I remember, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I was telling Aki about
this, the "Goodfellas" movie, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause she'd never seen it before, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and she was like, "Who's in it?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, you know, Robert De
Niro and like Joe Pesci." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> She was like, "Yeah, I know." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I was like, "Oh, and
Ray Liotta is in it as well." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And she's like, "Oh yeah, I
know that guy from 'Bee Movie.'" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - How does she know that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause she loves "Bee Movie!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "You're dead to me." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, that poor man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ray Liotta's legacy is
literally "Goodfellas" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and "Bee Movie."
- And "Bee Movie." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I deadass can't think
of another Ray Liotta movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure he's been in a
bunch of other movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know I've seen him in other things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just can't think of it
off the top of my head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I mean like I don't really have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to explain "Pulp Fiction." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like one of the most
cult classic fucking- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like cinema. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, I swear to
God, it was like either, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if you want to look like
you have a personality </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in university, you put a
Quentin Tarantino poster </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on your wall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's either a "Pulp Fiction" poster </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or a "Reservoir Dogs" poster. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I put a Tarantino film on my list, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so I guess we can debate
it when we get to that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Which one is the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, I've seen
everything by Tarantino. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He's like one of my favorite directors, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> but I still think to this day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Pulp Fiction" is, in my
personal opinion, is my favorite. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's really close between "Pulp Fiction" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and "Reservoir Dogs." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still put "Reservoir Dogs." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll save my points for mine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We'll save that debate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And then "Apocalypse Now"
is my favorite war film. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's the plot of "Apocalypse Now?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's it even about? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, "Apocalypse Now" is
based on the Vietnam War. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's all I know about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With like basically the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's told from the American side </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> where like American troops are told, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so Martin Sheen is the main character, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he is like set on a mission
to go and pick up a soldier </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> from like, he's like a vet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who's the director? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Francis Ford Coppola. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the same person
who made "Godfather." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, Francis Ford Coppola, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like this is like one of his
most famous films, I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you know that Francis Ford Coppola is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually the uncle to Nicholas Cage? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, random fact I
found out the other day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But anyway, so basically it's set </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where like Martin Sheen's
character's team has to go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> into the Vietnam forest to
go and look for this like vet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who holds a lot of information
about the Vietnam War. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Basically he's kind of gone insane </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and is living in the Vietnam like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it's Marlon Brando, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Marlon Brando. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Basically, it's, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So, Marlon Brando's
character is this like Viet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like soldier vet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who like holds a lot of information </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like he needs to be
brought back to the US army. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Basically Martin Sheen's
character goes in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tries to fight off all the Vietcong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and, you know, tries to
get him back basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But as Martin Sheen's character is going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through all of these like
life and death situations, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff like that, he too also
slowly starts to lose his mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then eventually, and then, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that poster there is pretty much- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fucking awesome poster. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, pretty much sums up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, that scene where he
like comes out of the pool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> as there's like fighting happening is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one of the coolest
fucking scenes in cinema. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wanna watch that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> That sounds cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Marlon Brando is like
fantastic, Martin Sheen is- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it a thinky movie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - How much do I have to
think during this movie? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, okay, so "Apocalypse Now" has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like a director's cut called
"Apocalypse Now Redux," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like three and a half hours long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How long is the original? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Three hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, it's still a long movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because here's the thing
about "Apocalypse Now" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause everything you described </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I already kind of knew about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I knew like the
basic plot description </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> What makes it good? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so in my opinion
what makes it really good is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just the, well, first of all, it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the music choice in that
movie is fucking brilliant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like everything I fucking love. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, in my opinion,
"Apocalypse Now" still has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the greatest opening scenes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of any movie.
- Iconic, iconic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Very iconic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's also just like, again, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like it takes that
like kind of war element </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and weirdly enough,
it's a Vietnam War film </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that doesn't really have
a whole lot of fighting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, really the most
amount of like fighting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between the US army and
Vietnam really happens </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like the first like maybe 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then the rest of
the movie is literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just you're inside the mind
of Martin Sheen's character </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as he's like slowly
venturing closer and closer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to his target and he's
slowly like losing his mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as a result of war. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like a very, like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a really weird
like psychological twist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on a war movie that you don't really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause when you think of a war movie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you think of like "Saving Private Ryan," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where like, yeah, there's
obviously a lot of like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> soldiers getting fucked
up in the war scenes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like there's also a lot
of like fighting scenes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, gun fighting scenes
or whatever the fuck it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whereas "Apocalypse
Now" doesn't really have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a whole lot of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, it's almost like
a psychological horror set </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> during the Vietnam War. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think that's what makes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> personally that's what makes
it really interesting to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause the thing is I think I know more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about "Apocalypse Now" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> than actually seeing the movie itself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I know like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think this has like a
really interesting story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> behind how it was made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like I think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the director himself I
think almost went bankrupt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> making this movie or something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because he had to like convince
the studio that he owns </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something to like lend him
the money to make this movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And he was out there for like months </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and months shooting this movie
and it almost wasn't made. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think like Marlon Brando </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just refused to read the script. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, Marlon Brando refused
to remember his lines. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's been notorious for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But this was the first movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where he started to become like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then "The Godfather" I think happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> after "Apocalypse Now" which like then, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or was it the other way around? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it was the other way around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It might've been the other way around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But basically, yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Marlon Brando doesn't appear in this movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> until maybe about two and a half hours in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think like most of his
lines are just like ad-libbed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because he just refused
to remember his lines. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, how does that work? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How does that work? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think I've ever
seen any of the movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that he's in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but I know that he's like notorious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for being awful to work with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, you know, like during his prime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously he was a fantastic, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you know, he's still a
fantastic actor in this movie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as well, but it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's very clear that he's
not like at his peak. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I feel like Martin Sheen's performance </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in this movie is just so God damn good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that like he does such
an amazing job of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> really like progressively
showing someone going insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> My opinion, fantastic movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember, I think he
was on Joe Rogan I think... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Martin Sheen? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Robert Downey Jr. Was on
it and he was talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> that sometimes he didn't remember lines. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think when he did... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Which I think "Sherlock" he
remembered all his lines. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But other movies he was just
like, "Put an earpiece in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Just feed me my lines." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, especially
when he's like Iron Man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's just acting Robert Downey Jr. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - He was saying, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some films don't require
me to get that deep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> into their character so there's no point </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in spending all this
time learning the lines. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But like, I think for like "Sherlock," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was like quite difficult, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some of the lines in the
way that he was doing it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so he wanted to learn it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He was just like, "Yeah,
it depends on the movie." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But the way he made it
sound made it seem like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh, that makes sense. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Then when you hear about
like the third party accounts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of Marlon Brando, it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my God, this sounds like fucking hell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I bet like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause there's a lot
of big actors in this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like Harrison Ford's
in this movie as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - This before he's angry at everything? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is before he's angry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, but like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Just really, really good
movie in my opinion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And then- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - "The King's Speech?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was surprised. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> That came out of nowhere
'cause I've never- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What, "King's Speech?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never heard Joey
mention this film ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so to be fair, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this is probably the most
recent film I watched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that really made a massive
impact on me 'cause- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it 'cause Aki's obsessed
with the Royal family? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's because Aki's
obsessed with biopics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - So before I met Aki, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I never really cared to
watch a lot of like biopics. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Biopics are like movies based off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> of real people's lives essentially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I watched a shitload
of biopics with Aki. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So, like "Imitation Game" was
another one I was thinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of putting here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, "Theory of Everything"
is another great movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I don't know, something
about "King's Speech," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, firstly, I fucking
love Geoffrey Rush. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like one of my favorite actors. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, everything that he had, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he does such a fucking
good job in this movie as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I don't know, it's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a really simple movie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's just the acting in this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just so God damn believable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just so good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never actually watched it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> But I also, when I was
growing up my best mate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like my whole childhood
had like a really bad stutter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I always had to order for
him at things and everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know, this movie came out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think it was a big deal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it won best
picture at the Oscars. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, like, the only reason I knew a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about stuttering was,
again, my best mate had it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and had to go to a bunch
of like therapy and stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to try and get it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause he was like, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like even like at like
16, 17, 18 couldn't like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, order at places. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And so I just got used to doing it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then yeah, it was really interesting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I think in the movie
they kind of like gloss over it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But like in real life, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> the way that you like you can solve it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like so many different methods. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> My mate had to wear like a belt, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a big belt around his chest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to make his breathing different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so that he wouldn't stutter.
- Oh wow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, the movie
actually does go through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all the actual steps that- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, I haven't seen it so I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That the king actually had to go through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's really interesting as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's just cool to
think that like a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of this stuff actually
happened in real life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> At the end, like King George? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What's his name? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't remember. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know, whatever
the king's name was, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like actually got over
his stutter in real life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as a result of this dude who
just, you know, solved it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I don't know, it's just, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like, it's very like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because you like meticulously watch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> through like every single step </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and every failure of the king trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get over his stutter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like the ending
speech is just really powerful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and like really rewarding being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Fuck yeah, dude, you nailed that shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "My man, let's go!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I saw it a while ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just remember it was a good movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think this movie got me into biopics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, okay, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Biopics might be kinda cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm glad you guys didn't
put any like documentaries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, we have to
save that for another time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We'll save that for another. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we'll save that for another time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Connor would do like a fucking 10 by 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll bring a 100 by 100 for you, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can I just do like a one by one? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just "Supersize Me." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then obviously "Bruce
Almighty" we're talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> about like, who hasn't
seen "Bruce Almighty?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like Morgan Freeman as God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I still think of Morgan Freeman as God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just because of "Bruce Almighty." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the most 2000s film ever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is like the quintessential
Jim Carrey movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - When did it come out? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Might've come out in 90s. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I think of this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like encapsulates the
feeling of the 2000s. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly, like everyone in it is amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's still funny to this day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] '03. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - '03, God damn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because of this movie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> if I die and I don't see Morgan
Freeman at the pearly gates. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll just want to refund on life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll be like, "Take me to hell." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I specifically died
with the expectation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "that Morgan Freeman
would be here waiting." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then what's another obvious one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, "Austin Powers Goldmember." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Before we get to these ones,
explain the Japanese films. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The Japanese ones, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Explain the Nihongos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Wait, which one
do you want to hear about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] First one, the top one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] The top one, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So "Rashomon," so this was during a time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this was during like a very, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess pretentious period
of my high school life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> where I was like, I want to
watch a lot of really old films. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay.
- Oh gosh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So "Rashomon" is one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's done by this guy
called Akira Kurosawa. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, it's an Akira Kurosawa. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's an Akira Kurosawa film </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who's known as like one of
the greatest film directors </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of all time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hello, I'm a film buff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Mention one name. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Hello, I'm a film buff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm a pretentious film buff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I sat down and watched
every Akira Kurosawa film </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and "Rashomon" is one of them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's essentially, it's
really hard to kind of explain. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> But basically I think this
movie was made in like 1950, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Black and white film. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But basically it revolves
around this like one murder case </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that happens in like Edo period Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the same I guess murder is told </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from different perspectives
and different characters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like, it kind of plays around, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if it was the
first movie to ever do it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it kind of plays around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with the whole like
unreliable narrator like logic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that a lot of movies use now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's just like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the cinematography in it is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's hard to believe this
movie was made 70 years ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, that's why
every fucking big director </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and big film buff still says his name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Akira Kurosawa is
your favorite director's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> favorite director. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like, I feel "Rashomon"
was one of those movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that like took everything
that Akira Kurosawa was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like really good at in
terms of filmmaking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just like crushed it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into like an hour 30
minute like solid movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, Mifune Toshiro is
like the guy in the poster </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who's in like basically every
fucking Akira Kurosawa movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, he's one of my
favorite Japanese actors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> He kinda, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that like weird stigma of Japanese acting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it's like way over the top </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and like really unrealistic? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've talked about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which we talked about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, Mifune Toshiro in my
opinion like kind of took that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and almost made it his own. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause like every Mifune
Toshiro character is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like so over-exaggerated
in terms of like emotion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like movement and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I'd be very surprised </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if he didn't do like theater
training and shit like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, I don't know,
it's over-exaggerated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's still like believable,
if that makes sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it like, it becomes
really like kind of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what the
right word for it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know I sound very pretentious right now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's a real- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Go ahead, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like in my opinion, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like there's lots of really
good Akira Kurosawa movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the only one I've
seen is "Seven Samurai." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Seven Samurai." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The classic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a classic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that the one where that
like fight scene goes on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for so God damn long? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That might be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, there's a lot of like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was a really weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a lot of fight scenes
in Akira Kurosawa movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Seven Samurai," did it have a remake? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was a western remake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was a western remake, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> also "The Magnificent Seven"
is the Western version </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of that film, which is also a classic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think maybe I watched, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's it called, "13 Assassins," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That's a remake right of... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] That is a different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a different story, is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is there a really, really
long fight in "Seven Samurai?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know about "Seven Samurai," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like the one that I can think of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that has a really long
flight is probably "Ran." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've probably seen "Seven Samurai" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if you've gone through, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you went through the phase of going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through the IMDb top 250. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You've probably seen about
five different Akira Kurosawa- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like I watched a
movie called "Seven Samurai" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was in black and white, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was a fight scene
that was like two hours long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was just like sitting there like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "When is it gonna end?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know about, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think "Seven Samurai"
was even two hours long. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like three and a half hours long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is there a long fight
scene in "Seven Samurai?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was just a very
long movie in general. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you Google it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like long fight scene- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it's probably the
film you're thinking of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just wanna know if I watched it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You've probably seen it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a classic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it's definitely on the IMDb, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like there's probably about
five Akira Kurosawa films </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you go through the IMDb. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it's actually only one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's only "Seven Samurai,"
I was about to say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Big sad, big sad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because that's the only one
that's on the IMDb top 250. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So, that's the only one that
most people have only seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Even though he has like
such a wealth of work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, "Ran" was I
think his first color film </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that was also fucking fantastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I think the stigma is that a
lot of Akira Kurosawa films are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like based around like
samurai and shit like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When like later on in his career, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> he did a lot of like kind of rooted more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like modern day stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> There's another film </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I thought about putting
up there called "Ikiru" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which means to live. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's essentially this like
kind of coming of age story </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of this old man who realizes
that he's like about to die </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and basically like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, the movie "The Bucket List" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with fucking Morgan
Freeman and Jack Nicholson. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel that completely
ripped off of "Ikiru" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's almost like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause the concept is exactly the same. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like an old guy wanting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> to like kind of rediscover his life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like really like
give meaning to his life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on his death bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like told in like a really like cool, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> artistic Akira Kurosawa-esque way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, he's a legend for a reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> especially in the film industry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you're a movie buff,
please watch Akira Kurosawa. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, "Kamera o Tomeru
na" is a, there's this- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like a zombie movie, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so basically it's
this movie, have you seen it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, I was not expecting
anything out of this movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I actually watched this film- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When did it come out? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey sighs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Quite, quite recently. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, a couple of years ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I thought it was just gonna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, so the reason why I
think this movie is genius </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the way that it was marketed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So the way that it's marketed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you look at this poster and you think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, it's a zombie film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Like, a B grade zombie
film kind of thing." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's completely not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It basically takes the zombie film thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and turns it super fucking meta. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So basically what it is, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want to give too much away, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but basically the movie opens </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with this 15, 20 minute
one cut zombie film. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, there's no cuts in it whatsoever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you think, oh, the
credit's roll and that's it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then what happens is it goes back, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it shows you how that
one cut movie is made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but told in a fictional way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really difficult,
it's really fucking meta. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's basically- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ooh, that sounds cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's basically a movie on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and there's like all sorts of like weird, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's actually a comedy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's also like there's all these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like weird comedic shenanigans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that happen behind the
scenes of them shooting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that one shot 20 minutes zombie film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, the movie is about
the making of that movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That honestly sounds like
it's right up my alley. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I think you'd love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just like, this is, that's- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt wants to stop recording right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll make a fucking video on this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was not expecting this
movie to be good at all, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but it was, one, it's
really, really funny. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And two, again, like the
whole meta aesthetic of it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, whoa I've never. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it gets even more meta
because during the credit scenes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then there's a behind the
scenes camera of that camera. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, it's like a movie within
a movie within a movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, I love it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just love like the whole
meta aesthetic of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like I put this on
there because like for one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I barely know anyone who's seen it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've never even heard of it until now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess people will now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] The English title
is "One Cut of the Dead." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "One Cut of the Dead." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That sounds so cliche though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but that's exactly it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, it plays to the strengths
of zombie film cliches </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and just completely flips it on his head </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and just turns it into like
this wacky slapstick comedy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's really, really cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It sounds like an episode of
"Haruhi" or something, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like if "Endless Eight" was good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Ashley] Sorry, it came out in 2017. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I forgot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 2017. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 2017, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like the last
zombie movie that I watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that I really fucking
enjoyed was "Train to Busan." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I haven't watched "Train to Busan." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a fantastic movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fucking so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I can't explain why it's really good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause it's just like a very, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like, it has like the same beats </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as just a standard zombie movie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's just a really good movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just a solid movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is a solid movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Even if like, you think you're
bored of the zombie genre, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I am. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I thought I was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, if you're bored
of the zombie genre, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you need to watch that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I got to
watch "Train to Busan." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I gotta watch other shit too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, but like "One Cut of the Dead," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was the title, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "One Cut of the Dead," like, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I feel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if there's any movie I can
recommend on my three by three, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's probably that one
just because it's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like how we both put it
in the bottom right as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The bottom left, sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, it completely destroys
what you think about movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in a way that's like really fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And also like, just again,
it's just meta as fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you love that whole meta thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you'd love that film. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I put "Gladiator"
on there just 'cause it's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I probably would put "Gladiator" too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a good film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's just good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just very good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, there's no complaint. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I don't have any like
special memories with the movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I just think it's really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just a clean story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like history. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not even history, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like tournament arcs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's basically it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Gladiator" is just a tournament arc. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like Russell Crowe, he's funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Russell Crowe is a great actor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just realized, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is basically just a fucking
shonen anime set in Rome, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just condensed down into a movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, tournament arc, revenge story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's everything I want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Russell Crowe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's everything I want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I feel like it's this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like really
close to putting "300" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on mine as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Actually I think I like "300" more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like "Gladiator"
is the better film, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think "300" made
more of an impression. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - "300" is the more entertaining variety. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Before like Zack Snyder thought like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> before Zack Snyder thought, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I could put slow mo in everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "What if I just use it for everything?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "300" is so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not gonna lie, man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the slow motion fight scene
in "300" still fucking slap </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to this day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still think it's Zack
Snyder's best film to this day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I 100% agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, he just peeked with
that and he was just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "How do I recapture this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "How do I do it?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Let me do the same thing
with all my other films." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just such a fun film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's such a quotable, just
fun, like bloody, gory film. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's such a cool story too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's based off real life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - As much as we know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, somewhat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You cannot like watch "300" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and not just come out just hyped as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Just wanting to fucking punch someone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - The funniest thing about "300" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> in my opinion is just how they made Xerxes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> into this like nine foot
tall like brick shit house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When I think in real life,
Xerxes was like four feet tall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, he was actually a midget. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And Zack Snyder was like, "No, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "Let's get the biggest Chad
in the movie film industry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "and just they can play Xerxes." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I think, have you
been in a movie theater </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> where they've literally just gasped? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause like "300" is the
only experience I've had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in a movie theater </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where like the whole fucking
movie theater just gasped </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and that was the scene, that
was like the very final scene </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where he throws the spear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was such a good scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God, that's such a good movie! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - God, I want to watch "300" again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's such a good film. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's such a good movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can't not be happy
watching that film. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So fucking good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Such a quotable movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, like all of these films like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's at least one quote I can easily, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one or two quotes I can talk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's get into this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Austin Powers." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Goldmember" though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's "Goldmember." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's up with that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, I think it's
the best "Austin Powers" movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't really like "Austin Powers." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't like "Austin Powers?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I rewatched "Goldmember" again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just because like one of my
friends came over to my house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and was like, "I feel like
watching 'Goldmember.'" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "I haven't seen
that movie in like 10 years, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "but let's do it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that movie still funny now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like it's not funny anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's still funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You think it's funny anymore? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't find it funny
when it first came out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll be honest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, it's a... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Again, it's like that whole,
like, it's the meta thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like the fact that Austin Powers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> as a character is so- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like James Bond, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just so aware of
what he is that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the potty humor poopoo peepee humor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It really is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It kind of is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like that humor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why I didn't like this movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I've seen, sorry, the
"Austin Powers" series, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think I've seen all of
them and I just thought like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's, I don't know, it's like, for me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like comfort
food to just go back to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just like, it's either
that or "Bruce Almighty" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of comedy films </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> where I'm just like, "Yeah,
this is still funny." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I think it's just
like the peepee poopoo humor- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I feel like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was a bit too in your face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, when I think of "Austin
Powers," I just feel like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I like recoil in disgust a little bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think you know what it is- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's so many gross
scenes in that film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what it is about
"Goldmember" in particular, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I think it's like the
same concept as like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you see like, you know,
a troll face comic on Twitter </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's like it's so not
funny that it's just funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just ancient
memes put into a movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is the second one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This the third one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Third one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The one with Fat Bastard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, this is the last one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - And like Goldmember is
also played by Mike Myers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where he's like the fucking Dutch guys, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like, "I love gold!" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, that character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, it's so dumb,
that it's like, it's funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I put it in like the same
category as "Scary Movie" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and just, remember "Scary Movie?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - See, I didn't find
"Scary Movie" funny at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't find it funny at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think 13-year-old
me loved "Scary Movie." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then when I watched
it again, I was like, oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the same kind of
like hehe peepee poopoo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this is a parody kind of humor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And I just like, I never
found that too funny. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I love peepee poopoo humor jokes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was just a bit too in your face. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I swear I probably got a few
laughs out of it here and there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I don't know, maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I'm kind of just
like numb to comedy movies now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just because the like past five years </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> of comedy movies have just all
been really fucking mediocre </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my opinion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Haven't had many good
comedy movies in a while. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm trying to think of like
the last good comedy movie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, I genuinely- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "40-Year-Old Virgin." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I genuinely think it
might be "Goldmember." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I deadass can't
think of comedy movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that came out after this
that was like nearly as fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pretty sure "Superbad"
came after this, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - As a white guy, I'm
obliged to say "Stepbrothers" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though I don't really feel that way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - See, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Hot take, since we're all
doing hot takes on movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think I've ever laughed
at a Will Ferrell movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I mean- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - There isn't a single Will Ferrell movie- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't actually think
"Stepbrothers" is very good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just joking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's one scene in
"Stepbrothers" that I was like, ha. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I was like 15
'cause I think that movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just came out, 15, 16. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna check Will
Ferrell's entire filmography </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to see if I actually agree with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because like
"Stepbrothers" was like okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought "Blades of Glory"
was not funny at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they were the most six
to seven out of 10 films. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's his most... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, "Anchorman." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Anchorman" is just like just driven </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to the fucking ground now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know if that's just
like had the "Borat" phase- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, "Elf" was pretty good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like "Elf." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Elf" is overrated as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think "Elf" is overrated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] I think "Elf" is fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The thing that I don't
understand about "Elf" is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that like it gained like
a cult classic following </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> after like all this time of being ignored. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like "Talladega Nights." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I actually like "Talladega Nights." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it has Sasha Baron Cohen in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just looking at this
and I'm just like, it's okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Everything's okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, "Anchorman," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like I've watched "Anchorman" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> passed when like it was
already memed to death. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like the best part </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of "Anchorman" was Steve Carell. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why are late night shows
listed as filmography? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I guess I just
don't find Will Ferrell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that funny I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "The Lego Movie" is pretty good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's in that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Lego Movie." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, I like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "21 Jump Street," that was
the last great comedy movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, "21 Jump Street." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Come on, come on, come on, come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - See, I didn't watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's actually really good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was the last great comedy movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I watched the
original "21 Jump Street." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, the new one's really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - The one with, what's his face? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ice Cube and... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The one with, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like the really, really old one with... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Was it "21 Jump Street?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I might be thinking of something else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The one with Ice Cube though was okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who was the main character in that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's Channing Tatum. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Channing Tatum. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Channing Tatum and... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jonah Hill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Jonah Hill is just an amazing actor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, but like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I prefer Jonah hill in like
the more serious movies though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jonah Hill is so good now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - As much as I love Jim
Carrey in "Bruce Almighty" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and like all the Jim
Carrey like classic comedy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like "Mask" and "The Grinch" and all that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking love Jim Carrey
in all the serious roles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, his serious roles are really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The other one I was thinking like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll put "Bruce Almighty" there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just 'cause it's like the
comedy movie I can go back to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like classic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like if I didn't put "Bruce Almighty" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or any Jim Carrey comedy, I would've put, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> do you know "The Number 23?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like really
like kind of neo noire, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like the most serious- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You like that one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I kind of liked it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I kinda liked it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like that one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or like "Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That one's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And then another one I saw was- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Truman Show" is my
favorite Jim Carrey movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Such a fucking good movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, "Truman Show" is good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I don't know something
about "The Number 23" was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was so fucking edgy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that it just became entertaining again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where like, it's like a point of edgy-ness </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's like, it just
all comes back around- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wasn't that like destroyed by critics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like being pretentious? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was destroyed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, look, have you
seen my three by three? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's pretentious as fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Joey's like, "Ah,
yes, I don't understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Perfect." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think the fact that I
put in a Akira Kurosawa film </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> goes to show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I'm a pretty fucking
pretentious movie critic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What'd you guys think of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> while we're on the topic of comedy movies, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Seth Rogen films, how
do we feel about that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kind of the same thing I
feel about Will Ferrell movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What was... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Pineapple Express" is okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like ha ha, he smokes weed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like, if it's not like purely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just Seth Rogen being a stoner, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> then it's a pretty funny film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like Seth Rogen as a person. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I like the stoner actor Seth Rogen, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but like Seth Rogen in films,
I'm just kinda just like, eh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like his movies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You just turn your brain
off and it's an easy movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, sometimes it's
just hard movies to watch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't even think of
like a Seth Rogen movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, the Akira Kurosawa
films are not the kind of thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I can just put on.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, no, no, no, of course not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, you know you always get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just a film you can watch with Seth Rogen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually, do you wanna know
how fucking pretentious I am </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> as a film critic? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Instead of "Goldmember," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was gonna put "2001: A Space Odyssey." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would have actually been like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Actually fuck off." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Actually get the fuck out." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Joey, who are you trying to please? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Joey, who are you trying to please? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm trying to please myself, all right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - One thing I'm surprised </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's not on here is "Trainspotting." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you've talked about that a bunch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what, I completely
forgot about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Actually, yeah, can we
get rid of "Goldmember" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and put "Trainspotting?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, it's already done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Please? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do me a solid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, he did it with the
fucking gaming three by three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can do it with the movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Munon or whoever's editing,
get rid of "Goldmember." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] This is a shit movie anyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Get rid of "Goldmember," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> put "Trainspotting" on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Trainspotting" is fucking fantastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Someone criticized me because I said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> when someone, they asked me
what my favorite video game </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or whatever was, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I said different from what
I put on my three by three. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We make our three by
threes in like 10 minutes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not like the end all of our actual. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're just trying to
make some interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, they're fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm thinking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, I've really enjoyed "This is the End," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a Seth Rogen film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - "50/50" was really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, "50/50" was great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I haven't seen any of these. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They're ones where like the joke isn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just him being a stoner. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's why I feel like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait, is that even possible? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Occasionally he does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I think it with Seth Rogen, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I watched one film with Seth
Rogen in it and I was like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was it "Pineapple Express?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It might've been. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, I 100%
understand this actor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and this character now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Probably like that in every other movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "Pineapple Express" is
one of those movies- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, fucking, can I
talk about "Trainspotting." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, okay, sorry, sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so good! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, have you guys seen it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course I have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I have not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You haven't seen it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, "Trainspotting" is this like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> oh God, how the fuck do you
explain "Trainspotting?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know that it's not
about spotting trains. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is not about spotting trains. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, the term trainspotting
comes from heroin addicts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where they try to inject
the heroin into their veins, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so they have to spot the veins </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and that is referred to as trainspotting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So basically it's a
drug film set in Scotland. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Main guy is Ewan McGregor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who he is in his natural habitat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> He's in his natural accent, so
you know it's gonna be good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Very, very young Ewan McGregor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I think this is before "Star Wars." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the one scene I remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> from "Trainspotting" apart
from the baby scene was just- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The toilet scene. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, just Ewan McGregor
emerges from a toilet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I've heard about this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've heard of the scenes
in "Trainspotting." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - So very famous scene is where
Ewan McGregor needs to go, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, do a hit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he's at a pub and he
goes into the closest, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> no, no, that's right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, he gets the runs I
think from something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he runs into a pub
and goes into probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the most disgusting
looking toilet imaginable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just UK toilets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like actually foul. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he drops his drugs into the toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And because he's a desperate junkie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he took a shot beforehand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he starts hallucinating as
he reaches into the toilet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just goes into the toilet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and starts swimming inside the toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Emerges out of the toilet
with the drugs in his hand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a very, very bizarre movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I (laughs) I showed
"Trainspotting" to Aki, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and she stopped it after
five minutes and she's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Can we put subtitles on? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "'Cause I can't understand
what the fuck they're saying." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> To be fair, it's a very
heavy Scottish accent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, there were some
scenes where even I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, I didn't quite catch what
he just fucking said there." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, like Americans, probably
best to put subtitles on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Being from the UK is like
your English level is OP. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You can understand any form of English. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Any accent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The only reason why I
understand "Trainspotting" is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I like watched
it like over 10 times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I just remember what they say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like, it's very brutal film, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but also it's like, again,
like the music choices- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Sounds good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - With movies if it's
got great music choice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm all for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Same with my anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> If the OST is good, it's a great movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd say if there's like
two, like drug like films, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of like, how do I describe this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that a category? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Drug movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, drug movies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Drug movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like I don't really know how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to describe "Trainspotting." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just a movie about a
bunch of characters and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm already sold on it to be fair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Their lives revolve around drugs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like "Trainspotting" is one of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And the other one is
"Requiem for a Dream," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is not a film I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like people should watch to enjoy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I think people should
just watch it at least once </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to like realize, wow, I just
never want to try heroin. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's just a bad thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I mean, "Trainspotting"
was definitely one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I was like, oh, never
touching that shit in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, I was 50/50 but. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> After watching
"Trainspotting," you know... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you ever have a friend who's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Maybe I might try heroin,"
just show them "Trainspotting," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they'll probably be like,
"Nope, never doing that." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or "Requiem for a Dream." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or "Requiem for a Dream" as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I think I just got
full on fucking depression </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> for a week after watching that film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, "Trainspotting"
is definitely another film </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that is not watched
for entertainment sake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Probably more entertaining
than "Requiem for a Dream." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would like to say like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Trainspotting" isn't a happy movie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's like less bleak
than "Requiem for a Dream." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's a lot of great
scenes and it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, it's just, again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the acting's really
good and it's just very, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a very raw film. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Requiem for a Dream" just sounds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like something you'd give an
Oscar to based on the title. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - To be fair there's
some great fucking scenes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> in "Requiem for a Dream." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The title alone you're
like, "Fuck, that's awesome." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The thing I can say about
"Requiem for a Dream" is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's just, it's a
fucking powerful movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, it makes you feel emotions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is not pleasant feeling, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's fucking powerful as shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Speaking of powerful,
should we get onto my list? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it powerful? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Are you gonna live up to that expectation? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When you see this three by
three, you're gonna think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Holy shit." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Does it have "Space Jam" on it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause if not- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It doesn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Rush Hour 2?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - More powerful than any. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm curious to see what your
Quentin Tarantino pick is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what I'm- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're gonna have a toilet break now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Needless to say, it's gonna be powerful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I actually did put "No
Country for Old Men." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's interesting was is off-camera- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is mine, this is mine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Off-camera Joey was like, "Put
'No Country for Old Men.'" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Honestly, I was so close to
putting some of these on mine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] I knew you were gonna- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] 'Cause I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Maybe someone else is
gonna put 'Ip Man.'" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But that was so close to coming on mine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] This is a powerful
list I think, gentlemen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think you'll agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, you know what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The only one that I probably
have like a little bit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of qualms with is "Tokyo Drift." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Absolutely not! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is a masterpiece of cinema. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - If we're talking about
overrated films, "Tokyo Drift." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is not overrated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Listen, the main actor, you know- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - The entire "Fast and Furious"
franchise is overrated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There, I said it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's an impeccable character actor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the main actor of "Tokyo Drift." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if you're
being serious or not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He enveloped like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> nothing has mimicked living in Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> quite like "Tokyo Drift." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're right, you're right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I went to school in some, you know- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love all one Japanese
actors in this movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, when I was in school in Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with my black friend from America... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - We dreamed of going to Japan one day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and we were like, "What is
the closest we can get to it?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, I think- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wonder if you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Every single point of
"Tokyo Drift" is a masterclass </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in filmmaking, frankly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> From the very start, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the American high school scene, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's very, very much like how
it would still be in America. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Naturally I race my cars
and I cause a lot of damage </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and don't get arrested and get exiled, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which I don't think is a
punishment that you see. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know, a lot of movies,
they would just arrest him. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think he was really
genius that they gave exile. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, you know, like full speed drifting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through a parking lot,
which is just, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> if you've ever been to a
parking lot in any country it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just impossible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think there's not
enough movies that use exile </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as a good way of conveying the story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Name a movie with exile in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll wait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There we go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Probably for good reason. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a medieval concept </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that hasn't been introduced
in modern films, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exile. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exile, he was exiled
from Arkansas or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know where the fuck he was found. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Some hick town. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you know, his accent is just amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I love this guy's accent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So, so much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I love the accent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think I've
ever felt physical pain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> while watching a movie before
until I watched "Tokyo Drift." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm gonna be honest, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I have not seen a single
"Fast and Furious" film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've only seen "Tokyo Drift" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I, you know, because I
didn't want to be annoyed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because we'd already found the
best "Fast and Furious" film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so why watch another one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Garnt, I must say, you are
not missing out on anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, "Tokyo Drift." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you watched "Tokyo Drift?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I literally just said five seconds ago, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I've not seen- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's never seen it! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally five seconds ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't count it as a
"Fast and Furious" film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I don't count this
as "Fast and Furious" film. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a cinema experience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a totally different- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But somehow worse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you add up all the IMDb scores </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the "Fast and Furious" films, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's still not as high as "Tokyo Drift." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because it's
like zero, zero, zero. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Zero plus zero is still zero. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Tokyo Drift" is a great film </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is close to my heart in many ways. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Not only did it get me into- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Japan? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Donkey Kong because of the DK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's DK stand for? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That compelled me to
check out Donkey Kong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The beginning of monkey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is "Tokyo Drift." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This was actually- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the monkey origin story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, it's almost, it's just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> there's nothing quite as
groundbreaking as this film, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> quite frankly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So what's your favorite scene? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like the scene
where he breaks his iPod </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and then he still manages
to sell the iPod broken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then he doesn't check to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he doesn't check the
iPod before buying it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I believe this is what happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And then he purchased the
iPod then gets annoyed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that it was broken. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But he never once thought, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "I should check this
iPod before buying it." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Classic storytelling. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I thought that was a
really intelligent scene </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because that's how they made
conflict through a broken iPod. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What I want to know is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how are there so many "Fast
and the Furious" films? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, this actually saved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the "Fast and Furious" franchise. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did it actually? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it deadass
might've 'cause it's like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - This was the first- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - When you hear of someone
saying "Fast and Furious-" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think of "Tokyo Drift." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Most people I think
think of "Tokyo Drift," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, do the other
"Fast and Furious" films </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even have names? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it's like "Fast
and Furious 1, 2, 3, 4" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Memes aside, how does such
a shit film become so iconic? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, that's what I want to know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It is terrible by every single
metric of the English word. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But I love this film to death. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like "The Room," right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like "The Room"
of "Fast and Furious." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - "The Room" of "Fast and Furious." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it's just got the coolest name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, "Tokyo Drift," right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a fucking cool ass name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also, legit, I know we
spoke about it before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like it was kind of like
a gateway for me to Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, it- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was it actually? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It kind of legit got me
into Japan in many ways. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's great 'cause then I
got to learn actual shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Also it was the very
first DVD I ever owned, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was "Tokyo Drift." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's in a glass
cabinet as you can imagine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Vacuum sealed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mint condition. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, mint condition. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Had been graded obviously. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think the first DVD
I ever owned was "Shrek." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so "Tokyo Drift" is
a terrible but amazing movie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and I can watch it and enjoy it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you can just laugh at it now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's amazing to laugh at. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Some of the dialogue
that the poor actors have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to actually like say is just hilarious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it gets just not
fun at all towards the end. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it becomes too serious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Then it becomes too serious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - So let me ask you one thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] All right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why "Shrek 2" over "Shrek 1?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Shrek 2" is the best "Shrek." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Shrek 2" is the best. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, "Shrek 2" is the best. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Bro, "Shrek 2" is the best! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, "Shrek" run, set the rules. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Run? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is wrong today with your English? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Shrek 1" set the rules, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then "Shrek 2" perfected everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not gonna go against the fact </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that "Shrek 2" is a good movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Shrek 2" is the best, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Prince Charming is fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I still think "Shrek 1" is better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Shrek 1" is just an
encapsulated experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that is fantastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think the problem with "Shrek 1" is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that no one can watch it seriously anymore </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's been memed
to the ends of the earth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not enough scenes in
"Shrek 2" have been memed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think that's why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually disagree 'cause
I feel like "Shrek" is one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of the few franchises where
the memes have only like put it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into legendary status. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I am never going to
forget "Shrek" anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I can't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, Smash Mouth can like retire </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they've already been immortalized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> through "Shrek" memes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Shrek" is an amazing film
that you can watch any time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But I think people forget how
fucking amazing "Shrek 2" is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Shrek 2" is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, "Shrek 2" is a great film,
I don't disagree with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, so much better than "Shrek 1". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - In my opinion, like,
"Shrek 1" just inches past. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Shrek" is an 8.5 and
"Shrek" is a 9.2 in my head, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Shrek 2" sorry, is a 9.5. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And "Shrek 1" is a 8.5. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What about "Shrek the Third?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every single character they, oh, two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not even worth watching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Every single character they introduce </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in "Shrek 2" is a banger character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> They all like help the story so much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then they build on the
one-off characters in "Shrek 1" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you thought were a joke. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They bring them back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They're like, hold up, hold up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, there's a reason why
the Wolf was cross-dressing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's find out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're gonna see Gingerbread
Man and Pinocchio again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also they use the soundtrack
in very intelligent ways, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They do, they do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The soundtrack's banging. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is true, that is true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The rendition of "I Need a
Hero" was like fucking amazing! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So good! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is an amazing scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Puss in Boots is introduced. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I completely forgot that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Puss in Boots wasn't in "Shrek 1," was he? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, his standalone movie was terrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But there's a reason
why he was so lovable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's also amazing to think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like how many fucking high
profile actors are in "Shrek 2." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't the Fairy Godmother
played by Julie Andrews? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you want your career
made, you're in "Shrek 2." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Coincidence that every
single "Shrek 2" actor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is a god tier actor- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Antonio Banderas
was the cat, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why did Mike Myers do another </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like fucking "Austin Powers"
film when he was in "Shrek?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Why even try? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why, Joey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, that's because- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is the best of Mike Myers film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I'm not saying "Austin Powers" is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the best Mike Myers film. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Shrek" 100%. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause Mike Myers has
like two good films, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's "Shrek," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> one and two.
- "Shrek" and "Shrek 2." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Wayne's World" is overrated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Shrek 1" and "2" are his only good roles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll agree "Wayne's
World" is overrated now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, but let's talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about the Quentin
Tarantino choice you put? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Kill Bill." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Volume one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I like volume one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For number one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually prefer volume one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Volume two is rated higher, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's a crime we
didn't get another one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's a legit crime we
didn't get a volume three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just think... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think in the entire filmography </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of Quentin Tarantino films, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Kill Bill" is just
one that I just forget. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - See, the thing for me is
like "Pulp Fiction" isn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> even like my top five
Quentin Tarantino films. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think that like
"Inglourious Basterds," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Django" is better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Django" is not better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Django" is not better.
- "Django" is better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Django" is better! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> "Django" is amazing! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll agree, "Inglourious
Basterds" is up there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Django" though is not up there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Django" and "Inglourious
Basterds" are both better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than "Pulp Fiction."
- No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And "Kill Bill" is
better than "Pulp Fiction." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And what else has he done that's better? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - What about like "Jackie Brown?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look, look, look. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe "Django" would have been
like one of his best films </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if not for Jamie Foxx. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like Jamie Foxx was so fucking dry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know who was originally cast? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Will Smith.
- Will Smith! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - If they got Will Smith for that movie, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> legendary!
- Holy shit! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - He wouldn't have said half the shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Will Smith would have
carried that movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But because they got Jamie Foxx, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Christoph Waltz had to do the fucking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's Christoph Waltz
and Leonardo DiCaprio. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think Jamie Foxx
was great in that movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you remember after
the big scene in the middle? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I actually can't remember much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the point! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's been so long since I've watched. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because after that it's Jamie Foxx </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who has to carry the
film and he just doesn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jamie Foxx tries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when fucking decrepit
Samuel L. Jackson walks off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was gonna say like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually like, you know, everyone
focusing Christoph Waltz, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he did amazing and
so did Leonardo DiCaprio, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like Samuel L. Jackson is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like probably one of my
favorite things in that film. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He is so fucking good at being evil. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's good, he's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's not the best
Samuel L. Jackson role in- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's because every single
fucking role he does is amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, Samuel L. Jackson
kills it in everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I get that, but
like, I think his roll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in like "Jackie Brown"
was 100 times better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had more fun watching
like "Jackie Brown' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and like even "Kill Bill" over "Django." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just, I don't think
"Pulp Fiction" was that good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - How dare you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it was fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was too many scenes
where I was actually bored </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> during "Pulp Fiction." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, the scene where
they're at the restaurant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just talking, I was bored out of my mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What, do you mean the one at the end? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, the start, the start. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not the diner, the restaurant
where they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> were they having like
milkshakes with John Travolta. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, at Jack Rabbits. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I can't fucking stand it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That scene's fucking great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just think John Travolta
is like not a good actor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think he's not good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I don't know- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are these takes, dude? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - John Travolta is a bad actor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - John Travolta is very much- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Samuel L. Jackson carries, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so obvious because
when Samuel L. Jackson isn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with John Travolta, John Travolta sucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, in my opinion, John- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - How many scenes were there
without those two together? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> There wasn't many. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It was a duo.
- Like one or two, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and he was terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think John Travolta is- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not terrible but. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - John Travolta is one of those actors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where like I feel- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you seen his recent movies? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, but that's because, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, recent John Travolta
movies he's clearly like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has just been type casted as the bad guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because of "Pulp Fiction." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Because before "Pulp Fiction," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> John Travolta just did all
the "Grease" lightning movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So he literally went- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, he was in "Grease." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He literally went from
this like sing songy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like cool, cool boy guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to suddenly playing as
this like badass gangster. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And because of the
success of "Pulp Fiction," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the movie industry was
like, "We need a bad guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "who's also like kind of quirky
and charming on the surface </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "but is actually fucked up on the inside. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "John Travolta." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, like, "Pulp Fiction" isn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my favorite Tarantino film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's your favorite one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I put it on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's "Reservoir Dogs." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, I still would put like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I really love "Inglourious Basterds." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Would you say "Inglourious
Basterds" is better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than "Pulp Fiction" to you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd say it's about the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think "Inglourious Basterds" is good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's better than "Pulp Fiction"
but for different reasons. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do agree with you
where there are some parts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of "Pulp Fiction" that did drag. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But when, like, I feel like
the highs of "Pulp Fiction" are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just they're like the
best Tarantino can do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> "Kill Bill" is I feel like one of his most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> different movies.
- I love "Kill Bill." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Kill Bill" is clearly the
movie where Tarantino was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "I like anime by the way." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I really like anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "I really like Japan." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just love it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Everything about the movie is just so fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I mean, like Uma
Thurman is fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love Uma Thurman. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love the scene with, what's her name? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Kuriyama Chiaki who did Gogo Yubari </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with like the chain thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's so good! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love that! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just love fucking Uma
Thurman's janky Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when like Gogo Yubari comes
out like swinging the chain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and then Uma Thurman
turns around, she's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "Gogo danay?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That scene fucking kills me every time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, I feel
like on an aesthetic level, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's few that are as
iconic as "Kill Bill." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just such a fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and also the restaurant is
still like open in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, going there and
like seeing it and be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Fuck." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When you go to that restaurant, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like, "Fuck, how
did they make this happen?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's definitely like a
culturally significant movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, for the record, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all of Quentin Tarantino
movies are fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just feel like "Kill Bill"
is like the most different, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like, especially in
terms of Tarantino movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Volume two felt way more
like a Tarantino movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I deadass don't even remember
what happens in volume two. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - She fucking kills Bill, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Joey! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How dare you spoil! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't believe you spoiled "Kill Bill." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's literally there in the title. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've rewatched the
first one so many times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I've barely watched the second one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, it's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I've definitely seen "Kill Bill
Volume 2" a couple of times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just don't remember what happened </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> other than the titular thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would say that the only film, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, the only scene out of "Kill Bill" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that really sticks out
to my mind is the one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> at the end of "Kill Bill Volume 1" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is her against... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Lucy Liu, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Lucy Liu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, not Lucy Liu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The one with her against like the fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what, the name of the
gang that she fights? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's not the end. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The Crazy 88s. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that's like in the middle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that's like right before the end. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, right before the end
is when she fights Lucy Liu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's the ending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so the one, so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she fights the Crazy 88
before she fights Lucy Liu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To me, that is like the iconic scene </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the "Kill Bill" franchise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I felt like overall, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I felt like the second film
was just a little bit better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have to rewatch it honestly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have to, I think- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why is this your favorite
Tarantino movie then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Again, I think it's just how unique it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and how stylized. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, you don't really get
a movie like it any more. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, definitely not anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just such a good movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel this is the only successful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> live-action anime adaptation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this feels like it was based off of anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It had actual fucking anime in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, it's got a production IG. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's fucking badass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That scene was dope. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The whole lore when they build it up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh my God, it's just so fucking cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I love everything about that film. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like him just like saying, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "Hey guys, I'm a weeb." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like you said, but in a good way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in a way that you're like, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's definitely done from
like a place of like respect. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just, like, you watch this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and you just feel like this is just fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> This is just a director
having fucking fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's definitely the most
like turn your brain off type </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of Tarantino film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the best kind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] No, absolutely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because you don't need
to turn your brain off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to appreciate this movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But at the same time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it follows that kind of same style </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where you don't have to think much, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but everything about this just has impact. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Impact. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I definitely agree "Kill Bill' is good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I just want to rewatch it now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's been awhile. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you wanna talk about next, boys? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, honestly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I know you put this on because you thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I was gonna like, just
fucking destroy you for it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm glad someone put an
Adam Sandler movie on here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Listen, "Click," I love "Click." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, 100% easily the
best Adam Sandler film. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, a film made by Adam, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> this is made by him, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think so, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude, "Click" is so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Click" is a really good movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still cry at the end of "Click" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every single God damn time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Actually, I was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Family comes first." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all I can remember. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was really, really close
to putting "50 First Dates" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> on my three by three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No "Click" is actually good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Click" is really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Click" is good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Click" is one of those movies
that gets so much bad rep, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like I actually think it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come on, it's pretty fucking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Adam Sandler has a bad rep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - . Of course, there's some
scenes in there you're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "All right, Adam, come on." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But then there's also so
many moments you're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "Holy shit, this is actually
like a really good fucking take </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "on your life and missing out on things." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Especially the second
half where it starts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to get really serious. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> this is not the direction
I was expecting it to go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It shows that like when Adam
Sandler wants to fucking act, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he brings his fucking A-game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was like, "Wow, he can act?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Again, this is like, why
watching "Uncut Gems" is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all the shit parts of
"Click" are like not there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just great fucking
acting from Adam Sandler. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, it's amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just feel like people
forget that I think Adam Sandler </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> actually made good films. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like a lot of-
- Just lazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like "Click" might
be his like last great film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or last good film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I remember like he
just like fell off a cliff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> after a certain point but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now he just makes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's openly admitted
that he makes movies on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> basically if he can go to
a vacation on the place, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause it's his production company. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What a power move. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The movies that he makes,
it's his production company. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So he just picks places
he can go on vacation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> with his family. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think there's a lot of
good Adam Sandler movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I've really enjoyed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, has anyone seen "Anger Management?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really, really enjoyed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> my God, that's such a good film. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He has such a bad rep, but I fucking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like his films defined a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the early 2000s comedies I feel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Nothing wrong with "Click." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, nothing wrong with "Click." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Easily, I mean, fucking what's
his name, as well is in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Christopher Walken. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> He's the one that gives the remote, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he's the one
that gives the remote. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just wish they didn't
set it up so fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, in a Bed Bath Beyond he gets it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's like, yeah, he's
like a security guard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at Bed Bath and Beyond. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - And there's so many
fucking childish jokes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when he farts on the guy and stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then fast forwards in the room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, that shit's so dumb </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause like they actually hit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so many good fucking emotional notes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wish they didn't fucking
sully it with that shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's actually a good movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I love it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Although to be fair, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the scene where he like
smacks the boss in the face </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and then plays it, and goes like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Whoa, I just had a massive headache." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That scene is still really funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, there's some good moments. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I have never seen "Catch Me If You Can." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You haven't? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so good! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a movie I've heard so many times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it is the best
Leonardo DiCaprio film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's all I've heard from people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then there's Tom
Hanks in it as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And Tom Hanks is just a fucking delight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I feel like it's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you think is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you think Leonardo DiCaprio, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what movie comes to your mind? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think of "Catch Me If You Can." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think of Tom Hanks for this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think of him for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But then also when I think of it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it uses like everything
that Leonardo DiCaprio, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> especially at that point in his life- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What movie do you think of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when you say Leonardo DiCaprio now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably now "Wolf of Wall Street." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I think "Wolf of Wall Street." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's because- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think of "Shutter Island." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really?
- What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just really like that movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, that's a good movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's either "Wolf of
Wall Street' or "Django." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like Leonardo DiCaprio
has evolved quite a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> during his time because
he's been acting since like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Remember when he was the "Titanic" boy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Nobody knew him for
anything else but "Titanic." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, I feel like
when he did this movie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it like perfectly captured at that age </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> what he was best at doing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was playing like the sexy young guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he's so fucking good in this movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, he's good in every movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You need to watch this movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, I do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And this is one of those movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that I've heard people
talking about for years now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just never found
the time to watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's based on a true story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And like the guy- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a biopic? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is a biopic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love biopics. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The guy who it's
actually based on has done </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like Google talks now about how he, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I think he's done work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> He did like work for the
FBI afterwards and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think he was in this movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> or at least he was a producer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because I've
purposely like not looked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into this film 'cause I
feel like I just want to go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into it blind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, just watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's such a good story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And although obviously it's dramatized, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is based on a real
event, and it's so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like if I was to
actually do a three by three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like my top favorite
movies of all time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there would definitely also
be a Tom Hanks movie in there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh dude, "Castaway"
would be in here for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had only seen "Castaway" recently, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was one of the few movies that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You only saw it recently? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I only saw it recently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it was one of the few movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where despite how much
hype had gone into it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought it was as good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It lived up to everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought it was an amazing fucking film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Catch Me If You Can" is more
of a Leonardo DiCaprio film </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than a Tom Hanks film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like it's half and half. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> To me- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's two big names. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's two very big
names, and I feel like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, it is Leonardo DiCaprio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He does do really well in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like he
just, him and Tom Hanks, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's both of them in that film. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Whereas with "Castaways" Tom Hanks, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and what was the other fucking
massive Tom Hanks film that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Green Mile?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not "Green Mile." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was he in "Green Mile?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he plays the main security guard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Forrest Gump." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fucking what an amazing film. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That will probably be like in my- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also "Saving Private Ryan" as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everything he's in he's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Toy Story." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Hello? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anything that man is in
is a good film, straight up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just feel like he's the world's dad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's everyone's dad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He is everyone's dad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I want Tom Hanks as a dad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are you fucking kidding me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> My God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like we should
explain some of the plots </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of these. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Catch Me If You Can-" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just feel these are
such like big movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that everyone should know them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Catch Me If You Can"
if you haven't seen it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it's about a guy who pretends
to be a pilot and that's it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> That's literally it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And about a detective trying to find him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not what it's about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's kind of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to spoil too much! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, don't go too into detail. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't want to give
more information than that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just know it's a fucking amazing film, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I need to watch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like, I mean,
it's that, but it's not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but just watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, that's it, kind of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like saying like,
"Sixth Sense" is about a divorce. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it's the real life
story of a con artist, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's pretty much it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, and then, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I appreciate the fact </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you put "Willy Wonka
and the Chocolate Factory" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but the OG one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, the OG one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> The new one sucked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, the new one sucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's got its
50th anniversary this year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Damn, already? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just love this movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can watch like as,
from a young age to now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like fucking Gene Wilder is
like such a God damn good actor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Holy shit, this movie's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also fuck his granddad, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck his granddad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it's a classic
movie for a reason, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, already mentioned "The
Truman Show" as well, which- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Great movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was my favorite Jim
Carrey movie as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why are there so many, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like why are so many comedy actors </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are just like actual, just
really fucking good actors? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think you need to understand
emotions well to be funny, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jim Carrey is such a fucking good actor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> when he decides to act. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel sorry for that, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He seems like he has a lot of problems. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I feel like comedy
actors normally do have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really want to rewatch
"The Truman Show" now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because I want to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the entire premise
of "The Truman Show" is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's just, is it a twist? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can I spoil it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think everyone knows what it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you don't know what the twist is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you should know what the twist is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, it follows the story of this guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> whose entire life has
just been broadcasted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like, it's just his
life is a reality TV show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They've made a world around
this man to make a TV show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This was a "Black Mirror" episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> before "Black Mirror" was a thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is basically just IRL Twitch, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before IRL Twitch was a thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And now it is a thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Except that in the movie,
he doesn't want to be filmed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> IRL Twitch people are
like, "Yeah, let's do it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so you remember
Ludwig's sub-athon? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just imagine that from like birth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But he didn't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But he didn't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's "The Truman Show" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just a fucking amazing film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd love to see "The Truman Show," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> except where Truman is
just a horrible person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because Truman in this is a nice guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What if Truman did things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that got him canceled all the time? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Would people still watch the show? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Would the ratings go down? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How would they fix the ratings
if Truman was going around- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just gets canceled. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just getting canceled. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're like, "Fuck, we gotta interfere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "We gotta reeducate Truman." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] And then we joked
about "No Country for Old Men." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, I fucking love this film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a great film. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just one of those films that's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yes, I'm a movie critic." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think that based on my list </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you could say that about me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I do think that "No
Country for Old Men" was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> the first film where I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Wait, you can just like
make things this ambiguous? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "What the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's also not cheesy as fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I do like my very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of open-ended ambiguous films. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Memento" was one of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, you don't really have a film </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you follow the main character often </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that acts, behaves in this cold way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you're also like, you're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "Come on, tell me something." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they just don't tell you anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think the only other film </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's even remotely like that is maybe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like "American Psycho." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> But every single, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, when you rewatch
this movie so many times, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you go and watch like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you rewatched it a lot? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause it used
to be on channel four </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> all the fucking time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it did, didn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I used to watch it
all the fucking time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like 10 ad breaks in between. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, you know, you'd watch this movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you'd read about
it and you'd be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, that's what that was about." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you go back and watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh shit!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was exactly the same with, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was debating whether to put it on, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but I was like, no, my three by three is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> already pretentious enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was gonna put "Mulholland Drive." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my fucking... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Great film by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Great film. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> David Lynch is one of
my favorite directors. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I was like, I don't want
this to be more pretentious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I was thinking as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's so many things
in "No Country for Old Men" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I just love so much to this day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, the fact that he
just decides sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to flip a coin to kill them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And he went through with it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, if it genuinely went heads, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> he wouldn't like it would kill them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, holy
shit, this man is insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like, I've gone through
this like recent phase of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just like instead of
watching movies again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just rewatch clips from movies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And for some reason, like,
because I watched one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> another iconic clip gets recommended, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like, I remember just
rewatching the gas station scene- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I fucking love that! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And holy fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What a good scene. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think out of like the
entire history of movies, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of like tension, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't think of a better scene than that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's just such a good actor as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I can't remember the main man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> He was one of the villains
in the "Bond" movies. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But he's terrifying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He's so good at this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Those eyes, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cold blooded eyes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every single dialogue moment
that he has with anyone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like, oh my God,
it's fucking terrifying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's funny you say you go back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and like watch movie clips
of like iconic movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I have that exact thing
with the fucking court scene </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in "There Will Be Blood." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, Daniel Day Lewis is like doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that like insane monologue
at the courtroom, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, holy shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I need to go back and watch this movie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but I can't be fucked to
go back and watch this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually like (laughs) there's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's been the phase now where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I've been watching
a lot of movie clips, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes I just watch clips
from movies I haven't seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I end up just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You psychopath. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Huh? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You psychopath. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because like it gets recommended </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and like it's a good clickbait title. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, damn, that was a good scene. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I watch another
clip and another clip. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I feel like there's a
lot of people doing this now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I go to the comments section, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and,
- Psychopath. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I go to the comments
section and it's just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like it's people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who've gone through the exact
same algorithm journey as me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I remember going
through the comments section </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I feel like I've watched
this entire movie now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "just through clips." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, that's
exactly what I did! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Those poor cinema directors
pour their heart out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to make a cohesive
story that's well paced, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and you motherfuckers go
on YouTube and watch clips. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "I've seen the movie now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "I've seen four clips." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I've seen the TikTok clips of it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, I fucking love that movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can rewatch it as many times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, watch
"No Country for Old Men." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a very good film.
- That's a great film. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or just watch the gas
station scene on YouTube. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't do that! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't do that!
- With zero context. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You need to watch the whole film! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And be very confused why this
guy is asking this other guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to flip a coin. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's still a great
scene even out of context. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - The fucking dialogue
he asks people is, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the things he asks people are so creepy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The thing that stands out to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in that film wasn't the dialogue, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's when he puts
down the candy wrapper </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it just like expands for
like a little bit too long. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I've never been so tense hearing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> just a candy wrapper expand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also, the coolest weapon
ever used in a movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The fucking gas canister. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So fucking cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you're like, oh, this is badass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but fuck he's terrifying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> But man, that's cool though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really scary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I forgot Tommy Lee Jones
is in that movie as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he's the main guy
trying to get him, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> The detective or police guy or whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - The sheriff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - The sheriff, that's right, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then of course, last
of all, we've got "Ip Man." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fucking... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, what can you say? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the best, one of the best, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if not the best martial arts movie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially in the past 20 years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I agree with that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's a lot of, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure a lot of people who
are massive martial arts buff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would argue there's a
lot of the earlier films, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like some of Jet Li's earlier stuffs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> some of Jackie Chan's earlier stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What happened to Jet Li? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He just kinda disappeared. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - He kind of jetted. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - As far as I know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Get the fuck out of here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So as far as I know what
happened with Jet Li is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that after "Fearless," which was the 2008- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which I thought was
a fucking amazing film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was supposed to be his last, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was supposed to be his last </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like epic martial arts film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was kind of well received. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was, it's like a very
seven, six out of 10 film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought it was really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was, actually like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's really
underrated for a Jet Li movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, his older
stuff is just way better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But in terms of modern stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, and that was
supposed to be his last one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then what ended up happening was is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that the "Expendables" were like money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So that was actually like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's right, he was
in "The Expendables." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So that was like his last action film. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And since then, he kind of said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as far as I know, he kind of quit doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> big martial arts films 'cause
I think it's just too intense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, it's a lot 'cause you have to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> those scenes, like choreograph is insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just remembered the
fucking "Expendables" movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like talk about
the most wankerish movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, "Let's just get as
many big people as possible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "and just throw them into a movie." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just fun, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But have you seen this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen "Ip Man," yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - When did you watch "Ip Man?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I actually watched it not too long ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you recommended it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you like it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's really fucking good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, I love Jet Li. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's got one of my favorite
fight scenes is when he, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fighting the Japanese and
the karate, like 10 of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and he breaks their leg. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That scene I think is like the best, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the best fucking martial
arts scenes of all time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Talking about clips you
can rewatch on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, okay, to be fair, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right, yeah, that's fair enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can watch Kung Fu fights. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But like you can't watch that scene </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> from "No Country for
Old Men" out of context. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just, like the story of "Ip Man" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> is it's about when Japan
is invading China way back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I think there's a scene where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but once they've invaded they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh well, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Japanese karate or something is superior. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> "So bring your Chinese
people to practice with." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - To practice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's literally what it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, if you win, you get
a bag of rice or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And he's like, "I'll take on 10 of you." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, it's kind of cheesy, but it is epic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's so fucking epic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he like snaps their legs doing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel that kind of cheesiness though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in martial arts films is what
makes a martial arts film. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It totally is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like it set, that scene alone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it set the stakes perfectly
where it's just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> holy shit, I'm ready to
see him fuck shit up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he just takes on 10 black belts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's not even like the
end of the film though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like halfway through. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's the best fight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the best fight of the franchise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I remember when,
because the previous guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> he fought like three black belts, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he's like, "Fuck,
I'll take on all of you." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's just one of
the few moments in film </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> where you're just like,
'I'm ready for this." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You don't care how cheesy it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't care how cheesy this is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Especially like when you are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so when I was like 16, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever I was watching all these movies, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I legitimately thought like
martial arts is like badass </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like, dude, this is epic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But obviously now with all the, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the MMA fighters that like fought them, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> now it's not so epic
because you're like, okay, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the MMA fighters just kill these guys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But when you're like 16, you think like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh shit, this is like the
superior way of fighting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "This is epic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh my God!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, it's so cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - "They don't use strength,
they use speed and balance!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so fucking cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, now, not so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But back then, you're like,
"Oh my God, this is amazing!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a lot of martial, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like Jet Li's earlier stuff is amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Obviously Jackie Chan's
earlier cinemography is amazing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Love like "Drunken Master"
and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's such a good film. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What are some really good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's the, I forgot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what Jet Li's highest
rated film is called. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's his 1980s film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really highly rated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it "Fist of the Dragon" is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or "Enter the Dragon" or something? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Enter the Dragon" is a Bruce Lee movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Ashley] "Fist of the Legend." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Fist of the Legend" that's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's like, his, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like I think it has like
100% on Rotten Tomatoes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was about to say "Fist of Fury," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'm pretty sure
that's Bruce Lee, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's Bruce Lee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also "Hero" with Jet
Li is a really good one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it depends if you'd
like martial arts film </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where they use like wires. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, some people don't
like it when they do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's wire fu, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I kind of prefer it when they're just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like beating the shit out of each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that the name of the genre? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wire fu? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know it has a name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] It's called wirework. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wirework. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not really martial
arts, but it is martial arts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But "Hero" was really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 2006. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I really liked "Hero" which
had Donnie Yen in it as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And Jet Li. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - The story's so fucking cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think that story is cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like I haven't really sat down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and watched like a lot of Jet Li films. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - His stuff is actually
like really fucking good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause Donnie Yen hasn't... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, another one, I think it's called, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it might be called "War" or
like "Warrior" or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, it's about
like the three kingdoms </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or something in China way back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Ashley] "Warrior." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is it called? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] I think it's called "Warrior." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Might be called just "Warrior." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] "Warrior," yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's such a good fucking- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jet Li film? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, Jet Li's the main character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like this... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> About how like a general
got like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna spoil it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But just watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really fucking good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Really, really fucking good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I feel like, 'cause I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't want to put
another martial arts film </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on my three by three, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I feel like one of the
few things Southeast Asians </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can be proud about are our
fucking martial arts films. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause we have like,
"The Raid," "Ong-Bak." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, "Ong-Bak" is really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pretty much the only
thing of Thai culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's ever been like popularized outside. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, like I, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was really happy to see like the more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like gritty martial art films. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, you think of like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Ip Man" is more like very clean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "The Raid" is really fucking good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "The Raid" is so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Indonesian, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's Indonesian. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But directed by a Welsh guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a Welsh guy who directed it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that "The Raid 1" or "Raid 2?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I know he directed "Raid 2." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Raid..." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Who directed "Raid 1" and "2?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can you check real quick? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I swear, it's the same guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's another movie I've
heard of, but I've never seen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - "The Raid?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Dude! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "The Raid 1" is such a good premise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just get to the top of
an apartment building. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's basically just a fighting game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, Double Dragon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just Double Dragon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - The fighting, like the
choreography is insane. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] Gareth Evans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Gareth Evans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The most Welsh name on earth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Too Welsh names, Gareth and Evan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fair enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just like, it's so bizarre. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a Welsh guy
directing an Indonesian film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Hell yeah, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's just like awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, it's such a good- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's some cross culture
pollination right there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Hell yeah, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Look at us Thai and
Welsh here too, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, I mean, yeah,
I fucking love fighting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> martial arts movies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I've watched nearly all of Jet Li's films. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think I've watched most of them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I couldn't watch some of the older ones </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause they were
impossible to find online. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I've watched I think all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of Donnie Yen's films pre "Ip Man." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I haven't watched "Ip Man 4." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I heard it was okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really liked "Ip Man 4." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I actually it's my
second favorite "Ip Man." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe I'll watch it tonight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I feel like "Ip Man 4" is just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "3" was the worst. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like "Ip Man 4" was
just "Ip Man 2" done better. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because my problem with "Ip
Man 2" is that the villain is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> just so comical that I just
couldn't take him seriously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like, let's
characterize this character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, the whole selling point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like a Western audience
of "Ip Man" was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's the guy who trained Bruce Lee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's literally the
selling point of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Fair enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But he's supposed to be
like a master or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, that is a cool
like catch to be fair. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, that's how it was
marketed, and the story, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't, again, I don't
know how true it is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's an interesting made
up story maybe if it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if it's true or not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] It's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a real character but
the events are fictional. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's normally how it goes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with martial arts people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kind of hard to
survive some of the shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they go through. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I'm sure they
fought all those people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but they probably died halfway through. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I don't think he
did fight 10 black belts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, that's probably, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> probably dramatized. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Unless he's like a fucking super saiyan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's another Donnie Yen film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that's actually really good
where he's like a detective </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in a small town, I think in a village. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's really good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's like a mystery
of the martial arts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just, yeah, it's really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I forgot what it's called. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Again, I've watched
these movies so long ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It came after "Ip Man." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Same with Jackie Chan as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Some of his best works
are when he was young. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, fucking "Police Story." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, "Police Story" is fantastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Is that scene
where he jumps on the wire? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's completely real. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Were you
thinking of "Flash Point?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Might be "Flash Point," yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Or "Kung Fu Jungle." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's "Flash Point." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it yellow the poster? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] The yellow one is, oh, oh wait. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> We have the Chinese name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the one where he's a teacher, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Again, I might've
remembered it incorrectly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's been so- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] "Big Brother." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll have to go back to
the thing and watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I might be misremembering. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like one underrated
Donnie Yen film is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was "SPX"
or something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's the plot? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt sighs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, I do not remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the only reason- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - "SPS" just sounds like a law firm. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let me, let me... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because what happened was,
is that you had Bruce Lee, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and then you had Jackie Chan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then when Jackie
Chan was getting older, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Jet Li was making films. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then when Jet Li was getting
older, Donnie Yen came in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I don't really know who it is now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Who's like the main martial arts guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Martial arts guy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who is the main like
face of martial arts now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] Donnie Yen, but
he's close to retiring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it still is Donnie Yen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because he's in the new Marvel film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but they also don't
really utilize him much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, he's the villain, isn't it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like martial
arts films are kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like a little bit
of a dying breed almost </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in like especially in the west I feel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I'm sure, like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> if you go to Asia and
Southeast Asia they're still- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, the past 20 years
have all been from China. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, "Ip Man" is from China. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then Donnie Yen is in
"Rogue One" from "Star Wars." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But again, when I was watching that movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you can see what Donnie Yen does, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of disappointed 'cause you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Donnie Yen is so fucking
good, and they barely use him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He just swings a fucking thing around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, oh cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I haven't seen "Rogue One." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] It's cool, but
yeah, he could have done- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He could have done so much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like anyone, like a lot
of people could have done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what Donnie Yen did in that film. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like why, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're getting Donnie Yen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he doesn't really
speak much in the film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I don't think he
can speak much English. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All I'm saying is there
hasn't been a "Rush Hour 2." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> There hasn't been a modern "Rush Hour." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do a reboot with Donnie Yen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, honestly! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And Ice Cube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ice Cube and Donnie Yen! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> The movie industry, we just
gave you a million dollar idea. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Donnie Yen and Ice Cube in "Rush Hour 7" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever the next one is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] The movie you were
thinking about was "SPL." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - "SPL." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's the plot of that movie? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Can you tell me the plot? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] "SPL?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] My phone's in Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I remember there's
one fight scene in "SPL" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like completely just improvised. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, is that in the street? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's in the street. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's such a fucking good fight scene. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then because the
whole premise around this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the whole background
around this fight scene is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they trained
together, these two actors, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Donnie Yen and I'm not sure
who the other person is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they trained together. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And because they were so familiar </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with each other's fighting style, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they literally just improvise
this fight scene with just- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's so cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - With just this basic, okay,
here's what's meant to happen, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but let's just try to kill each other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then let's just get it on film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's such a good film as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Ashley] It's a story
where an honest detective </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's suffering from cancer
and about to retire resorts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to illegal means in order
to capture ruthless triads. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - All I remember was there
was a police detective in it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like, it's either like
traditional historical setting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or they're a police detective. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or it's a crime drama. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Or it's like a neo noire crime drama. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But I mean like, oh God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how do you like describe
this three by three? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do you describe any?
- Powerful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do describe any three by three? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can describe mine,
pretentious film critic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pretentious, powerful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Guilty pleasure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was trying to think of a word with P. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - P? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why P? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pretentious, powerful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Poopoo peepee. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, poopoo peepee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, I guess those
are our three by threes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hope you get to watch
some interesting movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> if you haven't seen some of these. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, please go and watch
all the movies we recommended. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have some movie recommendations </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that I will be watching, I guess now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I've honestly come out of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with some movie recommendations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this was actually like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Shrek 2." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Obviously. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I always got time for "Shrek 2." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We know what we're doing after this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Sitting down with some "Shrek 2," baby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But no, I mean, like
it feels good to be able </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to talk about movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I feel like I don't get
to talk about movies a lot, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though like I kind of realized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> whenever I talk about movies, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen a lot of movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I feel like you guys have
seen a lot of movies as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we even like off-camera, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we don't really talk
about movies in general. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it just has to do with the fact </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we haven't really
had time to just sit down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and watch some. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To be fair, I've not
watched movies in awhile. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, me neither. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like people don't
watch as many movies anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like if it's not on Netflix, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then I probably haven't seen it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd say I've watched like
90% of the films I've seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like between the
ages of like 18 and 14. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I think that's usually
like the period in your life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're like, "I'm gonna
watch a lot of movies." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's also when I discovered you could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just Google the movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, holy shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, my dad used to collect </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like a shitload of DVDs when
BlockBuster was still a thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So, like I just watched a lot
of the movies with my dad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, I watch a lot less movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than I did before as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> because now it's just all
been replaced by anime. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And a lot of anime movies.
- YouTube. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And YouTube as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But I feel like if there's
a big enough movie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then I probably have seen it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I'm surprised no one
put any Marvel movies here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who the fuck cares? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who the fuck cares about Marvel? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I care about Marvel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, Marvel's that one franchise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm just like, hello, I'm a normie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's not like, I'm never like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Fuck dude, that made me think something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "that made me like happy." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If I'm gonna watch a three hour- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, I was
really fucking invested </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in "Infinity War" and "Endgame." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I will say that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't even watch those. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Endgame" was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But again, it wasn't like,
I thought it was amazing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it wasn't like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I left the cinema, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like a week later, I don't
think about "Endgame." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I'm surprised no
one put "John Wick" as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was close. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought someone was
gonna put "John Wick" on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was just another one of those </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's fun, turn your brain off- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no.
- It's amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> No!
- It's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I'm not saying it's a bad movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - "John Wick" is probably like
my favorite action series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like in the west,
they have "John Wick" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and in the east they have "Ip Man." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's like, "Ip Man" is just
like the Asian equivalent </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> of "John Wick." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, man, I just... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It holds a very dear place in my heart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've watched all the "John
Wick" movies in the cinema. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like I've watched the
last one that came out alone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the cinema was empty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I had like such an
amazing time watching that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like the last- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, it was just fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I got to put my legs up on
the chair in front of me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had all my popcorn and I
just got to enjoy it, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It was so good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was such a good, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dude, I'm so excited for the next one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've only seen the
first "John Wick" movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm so hype for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It gets better and better. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The second one's amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Again, it's another one of
those like long list of movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I hear people talking
about saying it's amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, all right, I'll watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't want to be too
normie, so I didn't put it on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, just sometimes I
just don't know what movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to watch because I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's weird now 'cause
I don't know where to start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know, we're so
ingrained in like anime culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I know, you know, when
there's a hot anime coming out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But in terms of movie recommendations, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything from like the past five years, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if it's not been talked about a lot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then I just probably haven't seen it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I barely have
enough time to watch anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> let alone fucking movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey, you don't watch anime period. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I don't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't watch movies, period. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't watch anime, period. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's just how it goes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just read manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just read manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Just read manga and read porn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know who does watch movies, Joey? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You tell me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it the patrons? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is the patrons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hell yeah, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Look at all these movie goers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Let us know on the Reddit I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I don't even have to

<SPEAKER_05> I'm actually all open ears for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, absolutely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me watching movies is my downtime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I just, I can watch it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I don't have to think
about making a video on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I can just watch it to enjoy it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to me with movies is how I
feel other people are to anime </SPEAKER_05>
