<SPEAKER_01> - What's up you zesty zymolytic zoologist, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> welcome back to another episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Zoologist? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the only word starting
with, "Z" I could think of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's like one out
there watching us right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, he's like I'm Zesty, I'm Zymolytic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm a zoologist, thank you Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Welcome back to another
episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm Joey with Garnt and Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think I've ever met
a single zoologist yet, yet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They'll be the one comment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now there's gonna be that
one comment being like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Zesty zymolytic zoologist here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm right here, I'm right here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do I know a zoologist? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know a zoologist.
- Yeah, I do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wouldn't be surprised </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you knew one,
- Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I feel like in Australia there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot more zoologist there because- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's just next door
neighbor Ted, isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because there's just so much
more wildlife over there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they're all there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, everyone needs to be a zoologist, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> otherwise how do you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what's gonna kill you there or not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, you've never been Birmingham? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every time a snake pops up it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Someone call a zoologist." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And Ted is like, "Yeah, all
right let's have a look at this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, you're right, you're
right, she'll be all right." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd never met someone
who does stuff with zoos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is sad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] What do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] People who work with animals- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You've never met a depressed zoologist? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - People who like work with animals </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> are always like the most
chill, happiest people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - To be fair I would be- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They have the best customers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would be pretty happy as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I could work with animals.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, when you hear about these, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they're always in Australia like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, we work on the coast." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're just like, they
like help coral or some shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're just always like
super happy, they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "You wanna save the coral?"
- Well I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what kind of message
will they be presenting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if they're like super sad? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want a miserable zoologist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - (deep sighing) Yeah, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - who's like, "Turns out planet is dying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's fucking annoying, can't do it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, there's fucking kangaroos
living outta my backyard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know I feel like
you're either like happy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you're working with animals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you like to be around, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Mmm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause you've chosen to
be in that profession- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - First choice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or I mean like, the
only thing I can think of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is people who work with
like, venomous animals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or something like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or animals that can put you in danger, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but if that's the case, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to be someone
who's enthusiastic enough- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they love it, they're like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They fucking love it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're like, "Oh, don't
pet the crocodile too hard, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna chuck it, I'm gonna jump on it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's like those videos
of like the, those like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, venomous like
snakes and spider collectors, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they're just like every time they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, I just got
a brand new tarantula, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this thing could kill me in an instant, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but my God she's a beauty." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know like, they're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're so happy to see this
like really a, to be fair, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of venomous creatures
do look fucking cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Grant] Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Would I wanna be around one though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Does your life insurance- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does your life insurance cost up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you own like a
venomous spider or snake? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You might have to maybe
like double VAX actually, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, like double,
like double life insurance. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think you can vaccinate
these venomous things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can I like double life insurance? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think that's how venom works. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm pretty sure it's not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm pretty sure you have to
wait until you get poisoned. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think that there's
a snake with like COVID venom, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, like the newest str, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the Delta strain
of like the Cobra venom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But wouldn't it be so
cool if like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> anti-venom just like worked
like that or like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> antidotes for venomous poison,
which is what would work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Would you
really wanna sit there? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just like, yeah let me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can I get the Cobra shot real quick? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even if you did, you wouldn't get it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause like, why would you, why
would any normal person need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 100 different fucking
snake infection, venom, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're not fucking Killua
from, "Hunter Hunter," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't need poison training. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, but like, what if you're
like going to like a specific </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like area of the world that
has like a specific danger? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they do.
- Specific danger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you go to like certain places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that have like really bad
mosquitoes or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you get-
- Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So why don't like people
who say like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> decide like, oh, I wanna go
to the Australian Outback, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> be like, all right just gimme- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think it's
that much of a concern. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, yeah, you think,
- I feel like if more, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - until you hear about people dying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like you have
more chance of getting hit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like by a car in the airport,
than you do from getting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I feel like we should
ban cars before we ban- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - With Sydney airport definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that place is a fucking mess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just feels like the dumbest superpower </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> anyone could hope for.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like that one guy
in like, "My Hero Academia" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who has quirks against
like every anti-venom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's only useful in Australia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like everywhere else in the
world, he's just useless. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's like born in the
UK, he's like, "Well, fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't use this at all." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Well, you can though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it just takes fucking long time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, I mean, you
can build up some resistances </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like, some venoms. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno how much you
can build up resistance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I dunno if there's
been any studies of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anyone who's like tried to
build up enough resistance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to like, take on like a back black Cobra </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- But I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't think you'd need to.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think you need to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, you caused it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You just get more used to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it's, it's like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The more you get bitten, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the more resistant you become. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I assume if there is
like, something that makes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, like those ants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or something that like
make you really in pain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe if you just like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What ants specifi, like fire ant, like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - A bunch of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, like the bullet ant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What if you got bitten
by one every single day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> shortly after a while is,
you wouldn't phase you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> after like 10 years, maybe
someone wants to try this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, no, because some experiment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We want to be bitten by a bullet ant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every day for the next 10 years? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Isn't there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that tribe that is like,
revolved around putting a glove </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of bullet ants on your hands? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I think they do it
every day there. I think it's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think, they don't do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's it's like a, it's like
Tim, where's my, where's my, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like my fire ant glove somewhere? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Honey, honey, honey, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's trying to be a fire ant
glove." "Yes, dear. Ahh!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm pretty sure it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a thing that they do during ceremonies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like to initiate
like a kid into chi, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into adulthood or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Adulthood,
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like, from what I can understand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like the people in the tribe
are more resistant to that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> venom than other people who have tried it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, yeah. Obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I mean, I dunno why they
like who, who decided that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Who decided that they would
do that as a ceremony? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, let's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get a bunch of fucking ants to sting you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "You're a man now, boy." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanna hear like the
council meeting of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when they decided that
they were like, "All right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So, Jim's just turned 18,
you know, he's, he's, he's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he's ready to bear children.
He's ready to be a dad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah.
- But we need like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a ceremonious thing." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some guy was like, "Maybe
just share a beer with him?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, "Yeah. That's kinda like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what if we though, hear me out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put his hands into a
fire ant nest?" Genius. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I, part of me gets it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm, I understand why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, you know, I'm
not here to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> wow, your culture is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause, think about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> We, we look at the fuckin'
stars and we are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, well it turns out I'm I'm angry." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So what, what, what
- You know, with, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You, what, what, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - With like Star Signs and stuff? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, the only difference
is that we just agree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You talk about like astrology. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm joking, being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, I'm gonna get married
tomorrow, apparently." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, oh, oh, I thought I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think angry is a Star Star. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No, you could be angry right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> From the Star Sign. Point is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mad at Ares? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't fucking know. I
don't keep up with this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All Ares are angry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mercury's in retrograde, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I gotta put the fucking snake glove on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Like I, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they probably thought that
it had some meaning and it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably carries some value. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Of course,
- Like I'm sure, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Here's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We know that like jumping in a cold bath </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or something is good for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yes.
- We know that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause of science. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like cold showers and stuff, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] But before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if there was no science backing this up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Kind of jump in this bath for
sci, for, for health reasons, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd be like, fuck off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not jumping in a cold bath. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why would I jump in a cold bath? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not doing that. It's stupid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean,
- Why would that help me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wouldn't do it, even if I
knew there was health reasons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, but like, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, now that there is, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I can understand why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe these people have
this notion that like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure, there might
even be health benefits </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to getting bitten by ants, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe there is, we haven't,
we just haven't researched it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's so many things
that haven't been researched. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> We don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't, I don't think this is
worth researching personally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, what if I told you that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, if you like, you
know, inflated your, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your big toe once a year, would
help with curing Alzheimer's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd probably be like, "Well
shit, I'm not gonna do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But thanks," you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's so many things
that can help, "X" disease, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or help stop things.
- [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're like, I'm just,
I'm just not gonna do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When they're like, that one paper came out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that one time that was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Research suggest eating no
more than five french fries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> at a time to lower the risk of cancer." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, let's be honest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm never gonna eat less
than five French fries. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (Joey giggling)
- That's just impractical. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just not gonna do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Go to McDonald's be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think like at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people just don't care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, they don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like if they couldn't
convince smokers to stop smoking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by like, actual scientific
research that prove </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that it heavily increases
your chance to get cancer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the more you smoke, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if they couldn't convince humanity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to stop smoking after that, then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There not stopping anyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then what would like, five french fries? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like avoid fi, like eating
less than five French fries. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because like
the moment you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, you should probably
stop smoking 'cause you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it could give you every
type of lung cancer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or you know, just cancer in general." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then they're just be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- "Dude, that's kinda cool." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think.
- [Joey] And that's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But as humans like, we're so shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> at recognizing long term effects </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and by long term like,
more than like a week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like something effect, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we just don't think it'll affect us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because it's like,
"Oh it's a week away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Anything could happen.
I can die tomorrow." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We just ignore the fact that bad stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can happen to us by doing everything now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But, yet isn't it so weird
that there's such like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a disposition between
people who are like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they're like, "Oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's happening in like,
three days from now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's basically never gonna happen." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> To, to people who, you know, say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> believe in things like
astrology, where they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, in 73 in years and four days time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna get hit by a car. Well fuck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I better stop preparing." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which astrology are you reading? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know like, like those kinds of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- belief space, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like systems, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you know, not to like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not to throw anyone's
belief system under the bus, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can believe whatever
the fuck you want, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, that was one thing I
always had trouble, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> coming to terms with, with
that kind of stuff, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so up in the air,
that it really, and, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's not backed up
by science in any way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as of right now that
it's like, you know, how, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why would you even think
about something like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Whereas like, with smoking,
for example, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Well, yeah, I had like seven
of my fuckin', you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> friends granddads die
because of lung cancer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably due to smoking." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you should, you know, if
that doesn't convince you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I mean, I guess
it comes down to the point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where like, it's like even now science, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as sad as it is, science in
the, in this day and age, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't always like the determining factor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> over whether people listen
to what science says </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or not, because nowadays it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'cause science is the government, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And you don't wanna trust
the government, do you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I think science, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the problem is with science </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know, the, this
age of like misinformation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just not knowing one is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of misinformation out there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yep.
- and not knowing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which sources to trust. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And number two, science
has just got so advanced </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that the normal person isn't gonna be able </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to follow along with what science says, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because the logic is so past </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what a normal person would
be able to understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you might as well be talking about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> God or fuckin' stars in the sky. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like, you know,
how am I gonna understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the fuck scientist are researching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it comes to like making
mini black holes in the sun, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like Institute or whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing)
- like, and they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fuckin' firing protons to each other. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like what the fuck do I know about that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You know, what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's that's so far beyond
my knowledge of understanding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just sounds like
science fiction, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It literally sounds
like science fiction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Unfortunately, we're a
sucker for a good answer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and an easy solution.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So that's
- So, especially when like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, the top researchers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and scientists in the world are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, when explaining like,
oh, how does gravity work? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're just like, we don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then they're like, "Ha, I
told you, must be Jesus." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- You know, like, just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we hate it when
we don't know something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Mm hm.
- Like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no matter how significant
or insignificant it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so, when immediately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when we're thrown into
that kind of situation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> humans are just very good to being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, it's magic. Must be magic." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A lot of the times we just
garner towards what feels right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- or what we want to believe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, it's like, we like to believe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we're all unbiased robots who only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go with pure facts and logic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But a lot of the times we are very biased </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> towards our beliefs and it takes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess, it takes a lot
more effort to unbelieve </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and unlearn something than
it is to just, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than it is to learn something fresh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or just like, build up your beliefs fresh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I'm sure that happens in like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between scientists as well, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, as much as you
think scientists are just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like purely like facts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and logic based only no emotion
thrown into what's over, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's been instances
where like, a scientist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or a, you know, let's
say like a physicist, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, comes up and be like, "All right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've got this new theory.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - About how the universal was created. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What do you think?
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Here's, a bunch of theoretical
things that, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've been researching,
all that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure there's been a couple
of scientists who are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "No."
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - "That sounds dumb as fuck,
because I don't like you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- That, happens a lot, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know, a lot of
scientists are also religious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Of them, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause there's a lot of, "We
don't know a lot of things." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And also science isn't about
having concrete answers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's about attempting
and trying everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then proving that
there's no other way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- it could be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything else, right?
I think that's the problem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that a lot of people have this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rigid view of science is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it can only be, science is 100% right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's not, we're
just eliminating things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we know for sure it isn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And so a lot of the time
when theories are presented </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or hypotheses or whatever,
you know, we have so, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so many examples of
history being incorrect, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- and we fix it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when we realize it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the problem is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that a lot of the time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that kind of gets
galvanized into being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, well look,
science is wrong sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they get it wrong." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, no, when we never, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> science is never ever
presented to know everything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's, we're building blocks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the most accurate representation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that we have at this current time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're building up a
library of what we think to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think like Tim Minchin
said it the best way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> He said like, "Science adjusts its views </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> based on what's observed." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah.
- "And faith is the denial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of observation so that
belief can be preserved." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm like, that's pretty
much it because it's like sci, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, as you said, like science
changes all the fuckin' time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because we don't know
everything in the world, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- So it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so we have to kind of make
compromises for what we now know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which could completely
change what, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like say like 500 years ago
when people legitimately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> believed that like, the sun
rotates around the earth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and not the other way around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then when they discovered
that they were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Well fuck, all these science, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what have all these scientists been doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the past 500 years wasting our time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Problem is, is that we are
really bad as like, humans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of understanding stuff we don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, 'cause if
you'd have back then, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it would make total sense that we, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the sun revolves around us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause it looks like it does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- And we don't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have any other way of even
remotely comprehending </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it couldn't revolve, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- around us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But once you find out, it's
like, "Oh well of course, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of course it, of course
we revolve around it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- "That makes so much sense." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's really easy to
believe in the thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that your makes sense in your brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That makes most like
logical sense in your brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like, yeah, like
I like I said before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like science now has got to a point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where a lot of the more advanced concepts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where the normal person is not
gonna be able to comprehend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Mmm.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so at that point
you're gonna have your, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just putting your faith
in a person of authority, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that they're under thing is good enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that they can, you know,
take what these studies say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and present that in a manner,
which you can understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But at the end of the day,
you're still putting a trust, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> your trust into something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you don't fully understand yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which, I mean getting back to the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting back to like, the habits </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the things you believed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even if, you know, science
is like disproved it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Like, do you guys have like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any like, wives tales
or like anything that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any habits that was formed from
basically at a childhood age </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like, your parents said something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you like, you, did
it as a kid because you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your mom or dad said so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, I have a Japanese grandma. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They are nothing but wive's tales. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like okay, so like to this day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like whenever I get ill, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I eat a shit ton of oranges. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I eat like a pack
of oranges, a day, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know a lot of people who do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oranges! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like, because, when
I was young, my mom said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, vitamin C is good
for the immune system." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where did this come from? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I dunno where that came from. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty sure there is
some science back to it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like, I think I've read to it once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and yes, vitamin C does
improve the immune system, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's like one, I believe, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is, all my memory,
so, you know, feel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> please fact check this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It also might have
just been Garnt's house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It might, it might have just
been my, household, but one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I believe that's to like, prevent illness. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, it like boosts your immune system. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's a more healthy immune system. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And two, there's only so much
vitamin C intake you can do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- To really have a big effect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on your immune system.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, but like that
doesn't matter in my mind, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause in my minds, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been conditioned to think, "I am ill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to eat a shit ton of oranges </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to intake this vitamin C
to have these Fuckin'." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Basically, just like a Pavlovian effect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like coughs once,
"Where are the oranges?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That's so weird because
in my house it was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you were starting to
get sick or you were sick, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My mom and my grandma,
especially my grandma </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> would make me eat a shitload
of ginger and spring onion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It just seems like a
healthy alternative but, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- Just one of those things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it has that taste
to it that you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this has to be healthy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why, but this has to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'cause it tastes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No one else is gonna eat this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It tastes so harsh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's 'cause it tastes like medicine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like it tastes like
medicine before even like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> being put in a dish, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, another one I had a lot was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if I got like a cut on
like my knee or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then you'd, my grandma would
tell me to put wasabi on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What?
- What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a very famous
Japanese one, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A lot of,
- What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - that's a very famous Japanese household, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where did that come from? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, maybe it's
because like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you put like an antiseptic on, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it starts to sting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah.
- But that means </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like killing the bacteria, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah
- Ohh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So someone probably thought, "Well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wasabi does that regularly." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that where the stinging? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think the stinging
is part of killing bacteria. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that's just like an effect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know if that's
even a wive's tail, either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But like I did, like when I
was little, like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was running around in the park and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then I fuckin' slid and scratched my knee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah.
- And, and you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was fine until I got home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and my grandma saw it, and was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh fuck, we gotta patch you up dog." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So then she went into the kitchen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "The bandages are over here." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She's like, "No, no,
no, no, no. I got this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Pulls out a fuckin' tube of wasabi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Grandmother,
what are you doing?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, no, no, no, no no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And she's just like, all
right, just hold still. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like fuckin' pulls, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> squirts some onto a finger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just starts like rubbing my knee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ohhh.
- And uh, that shit hurts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No fuckin' shit.
- Like, a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you know, I wouldn't
exactly say it worked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If anything, it just added
an extra step of, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> now it hurts and I have to shower. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> To get this fuckin' burn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It burns now.
- And it burns. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> my regular skin, that's
not affected by the cut. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Awful, awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So that, yeah, so, that was
the moment where I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Grandma, you should
probably like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> read up on like some, you
know, basic first aid." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just wondering
where that started from. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like, I can imagine
it's something similar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to putting salt on a wound, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Which is, you know, it's a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it sterilizes the wounds
as well as it could do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does it? I thought it was just painful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's,
- Could we Google this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This. I don't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Ashley] By the way, wasabi
is somewhat antibacterial. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. But if I pissed on your leg, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it'd be somewhat anti bacterial. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The problem is, this is the problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you, when these
things get some form of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, Yeah, you are 1%, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 1%, right?
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One right, I heard right, I heard right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I better add that to my
five minute daily life hacks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, is salt, like a,
kind of like an antiseptic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] Supposedly, creates conditions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that make it difficult
for bacteria to grow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Supposedly.
- Probably written </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> by the same person who
said wasabi was it as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, actually this is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought salt in the wound was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you did that because you
wanted to like be painful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you would like, torture to someone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? what do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What, do you think it's
like people in the painaline. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what we say, salt on the wound. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's like, right,
let's say I fucked you over, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to put salt in the wound,
I'll do it extra damage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It,
- Do it to fuck someone over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is painful, but I'm pretty sure, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where did they originate
from, salt in the wound? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Can you Google this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm pretty sure it's not meant, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not medical or anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like., it's to add
more pain to someone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I think it came from like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> salt is like a preserver, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So it kind of makes it
hard for bacteria to grow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, no.
- It preserves the wound. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is complete bullshit,
you're making this up now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Guys, actually, I don't
know where I know this from, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I,
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just making shit up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] It didn't means
what you think it means. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- [Ashley] It's(indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, no, no ,no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's no medical, "Step on a crack break </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your mother's back." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, that is not how that
works, it just rhymes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You think that medical
things happen to exist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because they rhyme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm actually curious where okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is it so, does putting salt in
a wound make it worse at all? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Does it do anything? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Does make it hurt more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I know.
- I know that, I know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] Does make it hurt more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's also like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it makes it difficult for
bacteria to grow, it does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It makes it difficult,
it's so vague though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like, there's a
difference between a treatment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and something.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just put some antiseptic on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sure. If I cut my leg off,
it'd be harder for me to walk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I, you know, it's,
- Put some salt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Yeah, that's why like you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you wash wounds with like
saline solutions, as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, you don't do with salt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] Saline solution. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but saline solution is salt water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's salt water, that's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You put like, you don't put on those, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the fuckin' rocks
rubbing it in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No we don't, that's not why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The saying isn't put saline on me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I cut my legs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - All I'm saying is if I'm
like lost in the wilderness </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or something and I'm like,
fuckin' like miles away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from Civilization. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Put some rock salt on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, just like grind up some rock salt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and just like just sprinkle
it on, sprinkle it on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Japan though, is full of
so many of those kinds of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> idioms, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're not taking medical
advice from idioms and, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, there's a lot
of like idioms like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> especially in Japan where
it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of them that, my
grandma used to tell me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> all the fuckin' time was
like, don't whistle at night </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because snakes will come. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah.
- And it wasn't until </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a couple years later I
found out snakes are deaf, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so,
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I started whistling
like a motherfucker </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> during the night time, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's like, where did they come from? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like I said, step on the crack, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Break your mothers back.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why? Okay, I, and as a kid, I even, I was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when I'd heard this, I was like, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that doesn't make any sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How fragile is my mother's back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, I've stepped on many cracks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Intentionally, after hearing this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to test the theory out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Would, am I a bad person? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Probably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You go home, your mom's
like writhing on the ground. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no.
- [Joey] Oh no, mama! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think about how
everyone has collectively </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stepped on a crack at some point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Isn't the earth just one big crack. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's, it's just, it's
all one big tectonic plate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Also, what does?
- All of Japan is a crack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also? What defines as a crack? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like if I were to step on an ass crack, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would I still break my mother's back or? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm pretty sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I bend over for a second. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Ahh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, how, amazing, how this, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> scientific fact actually
just rhymes as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Also, but other stuff that
I don't really believe in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And even as a kid, I remember
that whenever I heard these, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, no, that doesn't sound right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why? What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a cat crossing ,under
an going under a ladder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or a black cat crossing
your path is bad luck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's more
like superstition though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a superstition.
- That's what do you is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is chugging a bunch of
oranges not superstition? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess so, I guess so.
- It is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> They're all superstitions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, if.
- Wait what's the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's the difference? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just wanna go pee on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's the difference between
superstition and an idiom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, idioms are more
to explain, like it's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like an example.
- Raining cats and dogs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I see, I see, I see, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's an idiom, but, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, so yeah, all of these, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Replace idiom with superstitious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Superstitions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- These are all superstitions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, I guess it's
superstitious of you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to consume bunch of oranges in the hope </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it'll cure your illness, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's superstitious.
- I feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's another word for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You have no, no 'cause it's.
- Bullshit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, cause it's purely
based on like hearsay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and information you've heard and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, but I feel like there's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] These're all folk remedies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, It, I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's all superstitious though, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what it originates from, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's all underneath that, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Alternative Medicine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like it's come from
like someone's, experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that has been passed down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Superstition feels more
like supernatural, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where you know, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> opening up your umbrella
in indoors is good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's bad luck, I dunno
where that came from. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- But like, at least like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't do that anyway,
'cause why would you do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's yeah, why are you opening indoors? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, like what if you're
in like an umbrella store </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and you wanna test it out, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they have umbrella stores? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You never get to open it though, do you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you do.
- Oh, wait yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean it's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm cracking that bad boy open. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I crack that bad boy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's, you know, come on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if were my own house, come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then every middle aged woman </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in that store looked at
me like, "Superstition." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think they believe
in that, in Japan there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of people do.
- [Connor] Do they really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, a lot of people do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like in Asia, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the culture around
superposition is like very, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very prevalent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Because every, everything is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They don't call it superstitious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It has some kind of merit to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, 'cause everything like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause the whole belief
system is very like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> spiritual based, all right?
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I think a lot of superstitions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> are more widely believed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's like a, I'd say a scale of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- stepping on a crack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or break your mom's back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's like,
- The lower end of belief. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Well, yeah.
- Yeah. Whereas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe I've, heard this from many people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the vitamin C thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which I have, I dunno
if it has any merit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno if it does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno, it just like,
there is some like really, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really basic logic around it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you're like, I can kind of see that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like saying like, it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I have this theory that drinking water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> will help me feel better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like, you are right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But I feel like you are vastly like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oversimplifying the situation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's kind of like the
same thing with say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you like your experience with
like, manuka, honey, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like,
- Yeah, that is superstitious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is there any science behind that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like when I had, when
I had COVID I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking spooning these, this manuka honey, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like nobody's business. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It actually like, helped my throat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like,
- What's it called? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It felt a lot better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's it called? The placebo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Placebo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It could be.
- That's like a placebo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It could be.
- Which is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd argue is a branch of
the superstitious crew. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause, I actually remember, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Placebo is the documented effect, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that it actually has an effect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes, yeah.
- As in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your brain is making up,
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for some form of fucking
thing that you think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But placebo's so interesting because, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Ahh, so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - it's like, it hasn't been like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> properly studied and the scientists reckon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and like a lot of psychologists
reckon there is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something legitimate there,
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - but we just dunno what it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because we don't, we don't
know what the fuck is happening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it's like, we don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if it's actually a thing that works </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or if it's just coincidence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What?
- [Ashley] Well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the placebo effect is, that is, does work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We just don't know how. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We, we dunno how it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - it's document, it's like the whole, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember the life flashing
before you're eyes thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And how I was telling you guys recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was an article that
said they were scanning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone's brain on a table,
which is collecting scans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We didn't talk about this on podcasts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We talked about in the
taxi, I remember this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, that's right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've gotta remember things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've got like a catalog of our
topics that we talked about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey you mentioned the superstitious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We'd mentioned that in the
episode before, I knew that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but Joe didn't go on it for
too long, so I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I won't say anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anyway, the guy was getting
a scan, a brain scan, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- And you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's having a regular scan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brain checking what's
going on in the brain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh well what's going on there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And during this generic
scan that they were doing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the guy died of a heart attack. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And whilst they were scanning
him, while he was dying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I assume they tried to help him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I assume they didn't just leave him, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Now hold on, let's keep scanning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, well this data's lit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hold off, hold off, hold off, the data. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They did find out that
apparently right before he died, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was the part of his brain
that was responsible for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> memories was like firing like crazy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which would, although not proven, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's only one instance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It would back up the theory that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [All] Your life
flashed before your eyes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or least all these
memories start flashing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is makes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is one of those things
where it's like, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess that makes sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause a lot of people have
said that it's happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and although there's no
way to solidly prove it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - but that's until then
it was not superstition. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We only have, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we only have testimonies from people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who have been like near death experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then we have some
kind of not 100% proof, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but some evidence to indicate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that the theory holds more water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We kill need to kill more people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like right before they, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just like plug 'em out and just be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> quick get on the CAT Scan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, now edge more people, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We need more human experimentation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, we need, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Put an ultimate edge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's that fucking movie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is like, edging of life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What was that really shit movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where they literally edged their life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> The whole, concept was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh that one was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Flat lining?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Flat lining."
- "Flat lining." </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Going back to like the
salt thing and just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're not, you're
not gonna let this go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, because I, you just
like talking about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just reminded me about the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where I kind of got an ulcer, I believe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so, like you you've had
a mouth ulcer before, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes.
- So, how do you deal with it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I put like ulcer cream on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, what do, what if
you don't have ulcer cream? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what did, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just don't, try not to touch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Toothpaste? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - As much as I can.
- Toothpaste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Toothpaste.
- Toothpaste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've heard toothpaste works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that a superstition? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Again, could be bullshit,
could be bullshit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay? So like as a kid,
my mom was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, just gargle salt water, or like, or. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I believe that does have some, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because saline you're making, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If it's an inside the mouth, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're making a saline solution. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- It was like, I would, well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would always either gargle
salt water or, or gargle a. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Die's nuts? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Damn it, I was gonna say that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mouthwash, mouthwash, mouthwash. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sorry.
- All at once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was, I was legitimately
right about to say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what you said that I was like, "Fuck." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do we go from salt
water to Die's nuts? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We have a million people
who watch this podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I would either like gargle, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're a disgrace.
- salt water or mouthwash. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then one day my ulcer was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so bad that the salt water
wasn't doing anything, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- So like, as like a teenager, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, what if, instead
of just doing salt water, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is basically just diluted salt, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what if I just go straight to the source </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just fucking pour salt on it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that, I swear to God,
that's, so that's what I did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just like got some like salts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just poured it all
all over this ulcer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it fuckin', stang like
nobody's fuckin' business. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right.
- It stang like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it stang like fuckin' hell, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like burnt over in my mouth, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then it kind of numbs the wound. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember waking up the next day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was a lot less painful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It started healing straight away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now, I dunno if there's
any science behind this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have Googled it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I know like some other
people do it as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's no, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno if there's any
back science behind it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, after that
I started putting salt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on my ulcer whenever I get a mouth ulcer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it seemed to like, it
seemed to heal it faster. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure there is like, some
kind of science behind it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah.
- But like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel that's like, probably
the more extreme method </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of fixing, like you basically
just napalmed your mouth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah so,
- Could though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> As the science says, you're
completely wrong, there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So I remember one day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It could also just
be a coincidence that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember one day that, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one day Connor had just
coming in the office </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and complaining about a mouth ulcer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, I have
the perfect solution. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Walks into the kitchen,
just comes back with salt, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just pour a bunch of salt on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's it's easy, Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do it all the time, do it all the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember him coming in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> him coming in like the
next day or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was like, "Garnt, why did you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you literally just convinced
me to pour salt in a wound. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all you done. Didn't help any." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It didn't, I remember
it didn't help at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it stopped the pain for
like two hours in exchange </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for like one burst of immense pain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- But like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it didn't do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You basically just poured your own pain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that Garnt
would've healed naturally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without the salt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think he just poured salt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and happens to remember
that it then went away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as ulcer do go away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Basically, just did
like ulcers hardcore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The problem with illnesses.
- It doesn't hurt enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Illnesses that go away.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously in very serious illnesses, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the pseudoscience is very harmful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And very fucked up that people try </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and sell solutions that
are like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll be like, "Just take our herbs and, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and your cancer will go away." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, that's fucked up.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're even telling people that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the, I think the reason
why with generic illnesses, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so many superstitions come about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is because they go anyway on their own. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if you are doing shit
and it happens to go away, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're probably, your mind is, "Aha, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was sick one time and then I, I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I played with my poop for
20 minutes in my hands. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Play-Doe and it
went away the next day." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, well, no, that's, that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now I've got three other illnesses. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> ( laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I have, I have cholera,
but I did lose the flu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, you know, it's like,
you can do things, anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do it every single time you get sick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with a generic illness
that will go away anyway </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after 48 hours.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then you'll remember
that you did that thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it went away.
- [Joey} Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So this probably happened
with like the vitamin C. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You be maybe have a little
bit of placebo effect as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And then boom, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it goes away and you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well it must be vitamin C </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause every time I take vitamin C, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> my cold goes as if you did nothing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> your vitamin C wouldn't go away, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right.
- but it's not how it works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It would go away anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I want to like,
an experiment of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially with the vitamin C thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of like catch a cold one time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do the vitamin C thing and then
catch a call the second time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and don't do the vitamin C thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which one heals faster? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You'd need to do this
like a hundred times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to get any data worth considering. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, there's plenty
of sick people today. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But they're all different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You'd need the same person over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and over it put their whole life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And even then, it wouldn't matter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause we could just like
view the immune system anyway, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the things that we do, we. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dedicated my whole life to see. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If oranges work during the flu. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Turns out, we don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Science sucks, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause science is boring as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It takes a long time and
people don't like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whenever.
- Unfortunately, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe we can make it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They want results now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, yeah, maybe we can, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to another planet in 200 years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Oh shit, I'm not
gonna be around for that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what's the point? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Why do it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the problem back back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to humans are just so incapable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like, really caring about things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that happen in like the
far future and like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Global warming.
- Yeah, global warming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The reason why we're so shit with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not gonna affect me tomorrow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, fuckin' whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean like, I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've talked about
something similar before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like talking about just imagining </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> five years in the future </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like where you're
going to be five years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or 10 years in the future, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Could you imagine what
2027 is gonna be like, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause everyone thought in 2012, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that 2022 is like, "Yeah,
flying colors, right?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I couldn't imagine being
30 and here I am for 31, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like how the fuck did
that happen, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You basically dead.
- I'm basically dead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think same with that exercise, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I can't, I know
exercise is good for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- And I like it when I do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I just can't, I can't visualize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the benefits to my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly.
- That's the problem, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why it's so hard to maintain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. That's why it's
so hard to keep it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Even though I feel amazing when I do it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I normally have so much
energy, I feel great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know, and I can feel the
immediate tangible benefits. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- But for some reason, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just can't convince myself long term, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- that I can visualize that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hey, when I'm 70, maybe I'll
be a lot better off for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If I just put in the work now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even, not even that,
it's just like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 50, 60. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you could be
like working out, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And like a week later
you'd look down your body </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like, why do I still
look exactly the same? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That yeah, that size as
well, dude, that hurts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like it's, it blows.
- You get that pump on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- you do it, you go hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, "Why? Why?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then you eat like
two weeks of McDonald's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like, "Wow,
nothing changed, amazing." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which you love it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You love that nothing changes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then you get angry
when it doesn't change. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We suck as humans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what sucks, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that if you want to
gain weight fast or look, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> get ripped fast, you also
have to accept the fact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that maybe one binge drinking weekend, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> may fuck your body to death. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Speaking of human sucking,
I saw this recent thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay.
- That. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What a segue. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, because I looked
at this and I thought, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh my God, human suck." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But there was an article that
came out not so long ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll just read the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - By who? Who's the article first? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There was a lot of different articles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, okay.
- That came out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all over the place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I'll just read the
title of this article </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it explains everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Lonely Apers has just
launched a dating app </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for NFT collectors. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - A dating app.
- A dating app. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Somebody has developed a
dating app specifically, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for NFT bros to date NFT hoes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't, I think the
problem with this is is that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everything.
- There is well, everything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but let's now, let's I'm
gonna take a guess here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay.
- What do you reckon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the demographic of
people who have NFTs are? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay.
- Jojoesque dating app, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's gonna work.
- No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's let's look at this positively. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay.
- Sure, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So what you are saying is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we are going to be removing people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with NFT profile pictures
from our dating pool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - True, actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think, that's the a positive, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Surely, surely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that means that we are just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> forcing these kinds of
people to reproduce. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Forcing, these people to reproduce. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you saying people who like NFTs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> should not be allowed to reproduce? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I'm not saying that, but you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Is that what you're implying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well it's okay though,
they go on the metaverse, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's fine, let 'em have,
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just like, but just like
reading through this article </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just made me have like, several aneurysms. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "There is no need to enter or
display personal information. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Instead one can link their
crypto wallet to access the app. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Once logged in the user
can display their net worth </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and NFT portfolio," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's awful.
- What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "You can also filter your matches </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by their crypto currency
value and the NFT collection." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What.
- I, if I had a dollar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for every time I saw an article about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something to do with NFTs that I despised. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I wouldn't need to buy
anything ever again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, why did the? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd probably own an NFT. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd be rich enough to own an NFT. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd be very wealthy, I would be very, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they, I've not seen a single
good thing with an article. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's never like, "NFT
owners pledge to stop," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Global warming.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "To save the world." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- And it's like, no, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like NFT owners
pledge to have a yacht club </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where they all wank each
other off or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's all, it ever is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like the, the NFT restaurant thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, it's are you just making a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are you just trying to make
some kind of tangible effect, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you own an NFT? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, (growling) there's some reason, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's some reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, so explain what
this restaurant is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You need to own an NFT
to go into the restaurant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's it.
- That's it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you just like, you
just go up to the bouncer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you be like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's getting to the point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's just like classism
with extra steps now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually it's not even
any extra step, it's just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well we've hated on
NFTs, like so many times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just, yeah, it sucks, it sucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's yeah, I just, I
just saw that article </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, I
legitimately thought it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> an Onion article, at first. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah.
- 'Cause it sounds like one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I realize, oh the sad
reality, that's a real thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even if they, you know,
they could turn around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and win people back onto and NFTs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which I don't think they can. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] No,
- I just can't see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them winning the public
faith back in it again now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Since everyone has just seen
how much of a mess it's been. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't, you know, and whatever you think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the technology or
whatever you think about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what it can be done with
it, you have to recognize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that the NFT like this kind of landscape </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that it had has become right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Is such a mess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Rife with scams, fucked up shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- You know, money laundering. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just every kind of awful
thing you can imagine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It has had such a bad public rep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it would not only need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to come up with something revolutionary, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is actually good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It would then have to
win people back over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- By fixing its image, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I don't think it can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause the internet doesn't
want to make it more regulated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Doesn't wanna make it more fair. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] It also just seems, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They like how free it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it also just seems like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that community doesn't
really care about it either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, they do, they do.
- [Joey] Do they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause they push it
onto everyone and everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Well then, how come they're not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to do anything
to better their image? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're not.
- And instead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Making these fucking
dating apps in restaurants. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a free for all right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Every company and every person
is trying to grab a part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like the, it's a gold rush. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone wants that bit of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- So the reason why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone is shoving it down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone's throw, is 'cause
they have investments. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- They wanna make sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they don't lose the money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Okay.
- Pass it onto the next sucker </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who comes in too late. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and it's like, it's also so weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you see the clip where it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think Jimmy Fallon? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like presenting his
NFT with Paris Hilton. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - like NFT?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ahh.
- Of course, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. It's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it a meme at least? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Or is it like?
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It is serious, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I believe it's Jimmy Fallon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they, Jimmy Fallon and Paris Hilton. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, Paris Hilton was on
the, "Jimmy Fallon Show" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they started talking about NFTs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and how Paris Hilton
convinced Jimmy Fallon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to buy a, "Bored Ape NFT." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What a nightmare scenario. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so, it was so
weird 'cause it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never seen a clip of two people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more out of touch with
like, the wider world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So they like, so Jimmy finally brings out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> his like Bored Ape, it's Bored Ape right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the name? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, a Bored Ape, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He brings out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the monkey is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Board Ape. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - He brings out his Bored Ape NFT, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He goes, "Isn't this
beautiful, look at this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey giggling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is amazing." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like you could hear
the audience clapping. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've seen this image,
I thought it was a meme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Really?
- No, no, no, it is real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The image was put on
the picture to show it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and I've never
heard such a applause </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it was so obvious
that there was a big light </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> saying, "Applause Please," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you could tell
the audience had no idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the fuck they were talking about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Another massive problem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the whole NFT landscape, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that it benefits the
people who have big platforms. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yes.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> If you have a big platform,
it's free money for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why people are doing this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (coughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The moment something is advertised to you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as you should buy it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is the moment you it's too
late for you to make money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- You know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the moment that consumers are
seeing big names promoting it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's too late to make money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, some people might make money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The majority of people
are not gonna make money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the majority of
people are gonna lose money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the people who get money
are people like Jimmy Fallon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people like,
- People already rich. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - people who big influencers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people who have the platform, the power. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- To push people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> towards their investment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a glorified pyramid
scheme in many ways. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how do you get your money by
getting more people into it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's, that's how it works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's why you're
seeing, like when I anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or mentioned in anything NFT, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't matter what the comment is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> These, these verified NFT accounts, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like everything with the phrase NFT in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- They don't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could be saying NFT suck and
they can gargle on my nuts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> who supports NFT will like that comment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because they've Googled
NFT and they like everything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they're trying to get followers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're trying to get engagement. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So then they can push
it more and have more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a bigger sphere of influence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What if they just like gargling on nuts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They might gargle, they probably do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They probably do.
- They probably do, if they, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Like, "Yes, please." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hate it. I hate it so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause, it's so obviously a scam, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the moment that you
are being advertised to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about buying an investment is the moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you've already, you can't make money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, and I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what's so fuckin'
disappointing, as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Especially with, you know, as you said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like big influencers, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like getting in on it,
like, you know, when I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I saw that like
"M and M" bought like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> an NFT of just what looks
like a monkey version </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of himself, I was like,
why would you do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Very has my childhood died so quickly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The moment you have a
big sphere of influence, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just free money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And in their eyes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's low risk public image
because you are not asking your, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't have to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not like you're bagging
your followers for money, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but what you're doing is making them pay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for something that makes
your thing more valuable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's heavy incentivizing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, and you can claim just that you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just an investment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like buying a stock. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, no it's not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like buying a house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not like buying a stock. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's different, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's rules around buying stock. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For reasons, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even though sometimes
the rules are a bit fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Still.
- Yeah. I mean, I. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Feel very passionately about this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I hate the system so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I'm like the only thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have to add to this is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you think this negative
image is purely, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is purely based on like the Western circle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just like our
perception of the internet? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, definitely, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because like I've heard like
of the like NFTs have a very, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very different perception in
like the Japanese circles, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and, you know, the Japanese, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> especially the art communities as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause they see it as,
from what I've read, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at least they've, they have
a much more positive view </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of NFTs and they see it
as like an opportunity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to of course give, you
know, ownership to artists </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff like that, which is a lot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, given the
cultures, I understand why, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe Japanese people
would be more accepting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of this idea because it's
like for Japanese people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Japanese artists, it's a
lot bigger problem than it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm, I'm all for giving
rights to artists and whatnot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel there are other ways
that you can do it if the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> systems were, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> probably implemented, not to
mention that in Japan like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, the whole copyright laws </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Japan especially are just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the next level of outdated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right?
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like it's so like I think
if anything, the reason why, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course Japanese are gonna, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, of course the Japanese
are gonna look at NFTs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and think like, oh, this is perfect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like this,
- Perfect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - this gets around everything
that we've believed in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and done in like a really cool way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that supports artists like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like more ways to copyright, shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Fuck yeah, bring it in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> bring it in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That requires the good faith </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of all parties involved though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like everyone has to
be using it correctly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the problem is, is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - In English, were definitely
not at least, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there is, there are
some very valid reasons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to own NFTs or Bitcoin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or any of these currencies, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if you live in a, if you are a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a Russian person right
now and all your money was in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the Ruple, yeah, you're fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Like your money's gone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't, you don't
own much money anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you had that all on a Bitcoin wallet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, you'd still be very wealthy, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So that makes more,
that, in those scenarios, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it makes a lot of sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The problem is it's kind of replicated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the fine art world was before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like the big private investors, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was basically fine art, it was the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this glorified money laundering, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Money laundering. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And money transactioning thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And now in the West,
people figured out, "Huh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can make a lot of money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and money that you can hide very easily." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - By doing this NFT shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so, it's kind of turned into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more of a democratized, fine art, shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - For people, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the whole, you ever
watched like, "Tenant," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did you watch, "Tenant?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I watched, "Tenant." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, like the art that
was held in the airports. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it couldn't be taxed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's actually a real thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know that's a real thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Was that a major part of, "Tenant?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was a big plot
point in, "Tenant" is where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they steal the artwork </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and all the valuable stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the airport holding, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the tax haven in the airport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Clearly this movie really
made an impression on Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just remember things going backwards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's, like things looking cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like the first time
in like media that I can recall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that has like told people
that these things exist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - People didn't know these existed before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, it just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was that an massive part of, "Tenant?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like I would've remembered that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which scene was this in? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Was this in the first scene? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't remember them ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't fucking know
the full fucking playlist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of, "Tenant." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno what fucking happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They had a big, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was a big plot point
about them doing a heist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the first half of the movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was there?
- Oh my fuckin', </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The only thing I know is that the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 31s been run, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's basically dead.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When he dies, like his life
doesn't flash before his eyes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just, "Tenant" the movies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember them being in an airport, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't remember
them, pulling in a heist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why were they in the airport, Garnt? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why they were in an airport? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Why they were in the airport? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember them being an airport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is a good question. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe they were getting
a flight or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, they were investigating
the, they were, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is a complete
fuckin' tangent right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause we going into, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - they were investigating
the phenomenon, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the phenomena where time
moves backwards or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's that's all I remembered-ish. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can remember they're
stealing something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that was in holding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I thought, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And in the holding places, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they normally have art because
you can't basically buy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and sell in this area because it doesn't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - it's not under any
jurisdiction for the taxpayer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you can.
- No, I remember there being, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember being paintings there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I just don't remember that being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a massive part of the
plot point, but I over, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like, I brought it up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it was like the first
time it had been addressed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or brought up in like prominent media. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah, well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is, these things exist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah well, they've
existed for like a very, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very long time and it's
not just like fine arts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like, it's not just paintings, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any valuable thing, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Stuff in the British museum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's only the place
where they come from, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know like the point was is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's, I just think with the way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that NFTs are structured
right now, it's just, this is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this was obviously gonna happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was, it's just been rife with scams. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like half this shit is awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like yeah, there's some legitimate uses. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The technology seems somewhat
promising, right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fact that it uses more
than like, most countries, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the entire like Bitcoin network
uses more electric teeth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than countries. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is very concerning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that there are more, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're making new coins, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're making new ways </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are much more efficient than stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, yeah, we get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's not there right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not doing that right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not working right now in a way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that works for the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you think it would ever work out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it definitely will at some point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Obviously the idea of having a way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can 100% own something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> digitally is going to be very
convenient at some point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It, the way you said yes, like, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But right now it just doesn't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the way that it's being
used is like a joke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, I mean like it's weird to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seeing how fast they just came from, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like basically nowhere to
everyone talking about them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, crypto, I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well because, it has
been just been so, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just been shoved
down everyone's throat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every celebrity is jumping on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was literally, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was literally last year, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where I had not heard of the word </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> NFT till like May or April </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I couldn't stop hearing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I remember being, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I only found
out what it was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a couple months ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] On the fucking podcast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - On the podcast, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm so envious of you, Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I think I just like,
yeah, I just avoided all that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't follow anyone who is in that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And now there's the
metaverse that's coming along, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is just like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, have you seen that
these companies are buying like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> space in like the metaverse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're buying like plots
of land in the metaverse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, I've seen that, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So they're buying,
- What do you think of that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What do you think of that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're buying digital land. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, that's like, I mean,
I feel like it is just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's some sci-fi territory. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like the past year
has opened up basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the age of like the digital gold rush. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is this what it must
have felt like to see like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the .com bubble. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think so.
- I think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's that's that's must have
been what it felt like where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you see millions of fucking
dollars being invested in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like the dumbest shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> In like fucking kittens.com </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like, I don't fuckin' know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And now kittens.com is worth millions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if this is true, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you're in the metaverse right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They don't have legs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you seen that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They don't have, they only
have like torsos, upper body. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, this is very much
similar with me with NFTs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know nothing about the metaverse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, do you know why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sold off, online by Facebook? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's all I know. Do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You do you wanna take a guess? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Why they only have torsos in this world? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it for people who
perhaps are in wheelchairs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff like that, or? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a very noble thought, Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Unfortunately it's not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe inclusive of everyone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can you fetch it, Ashley? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But to my understanding, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was to stop people like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing like, implying sexual acts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff and doing things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> From what I understand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing)
- Are you serious? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - from what I understand,
that is the reason why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I read somewhere that like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> foot fetishes are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the most common
fetish in like the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's it got to do with Facebook? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well no, because the legs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because of the legs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, it's like digital feet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, "Ooh, ooh, those (indistinct)." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, where you
going with this point? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the weirdest tangent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well no, I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Joey just wants to
talk about foot fetishes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to back up your point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like Mark Zuckerberg, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> scared of Quinton Tarantino </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or getting in the metaverse or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was trying to back up your point and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you guys made me out,
like I'm fuckin' weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like he's in to digital feet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Joey's like, "Mmm,
them Sims feet though." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Delicious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why didn't they just
delete the feet then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If that's, just have no one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Stop.
- No one has feet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone's a stub. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone just looks like Kirby, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, just stubs and knobs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Apparently,
it's a technical issue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like the cameras can't
capture the whole body. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bullshit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's, I don't think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is anything questioned
about sexual stuff? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] I haven't found it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you Google sexual, Mark Zuckerberg, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> metaverse, no legs, sex. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fetish, fetish, Mark
Zuckerberg, metaverse, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> foot fetish. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] Also you can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What, sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] Turn off face search. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] It's already off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I apparently as well, there's like a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have like your own bubble, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people can't come into your space. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But to me it's weird, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I dunno if I'm just like stupid, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but it just looks like really shit VRChat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I saw. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, so is this like a game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that Facebook is developing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Or like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just looks like
VRChat, but just less fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like VRChat has really good games in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Have you seen this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] No.
- [Garnt] No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] There's like games
in VRChat and it's nuts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was playing Super
Monkey Ball the other day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] In VRChat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] In VRChat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How were you not sick? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know, I'm gonna say,
and there was also like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I get sick playing regular. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like a Tron game where you throw discs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and they bounce around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You gotta Dodge it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] That's pretty cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Try to hit the other person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That just seems like
a VR game in a VR game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so it is, and there's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a whole cooking game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In a VR game and it's like free. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, why the fuck
would any one party? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - How does VRChat work? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I never, 'cause I've never
played VRChat, but is it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like kind of like an
open source kind of thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where people can?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where everyone creates?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Their own games,
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - their own spaces and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's all user generated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay.
- And that's why it's so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like MineCraft. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause you'll be in
a lobby and yeah, does it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is it annoying that you get in a lobby </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's like 10 year olds screaming? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, that's annoying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And think mark Zuckerberg
is trying to address </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that by making it like age
only, like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> over a certain age allowed to join. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right?
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure people get the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's still really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's genuinely good, like I like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, okay, so going back to the whole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like buying digital plots of land on meta. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, like how does that work? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like what?
- I tend, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's more the question of why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, if you own,
- Advertising </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - digital land, it's like the
metaverse is being marketed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as this place that is
kind of like, just a new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> virtual reality world that
everyone's going to go to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right?
- [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you can literally live
like a second life or even like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, your online media
life in this virtual place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's called the metaverse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So what are companies doing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They literally buying plots
of land in this virtual land </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for treating it like
they're buying real lands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that exists in the real world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, this is just lame. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is legitimately just lame. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] It is, it is.
- It's scary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] You want hear like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the most depressing thing ever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Please.
- What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Investors are playing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> paying millions for virtual
land in the metaverse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And apparently a company
recently dropped $2.5 million </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on a patch of land in Decentral land. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One of the most popular metaverse worlds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - and the prices have gone up 400 to 500% </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the past few months. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, how much land are we talking? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like how many digital square
meters are we talking? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't fully understand it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Another person spent 4.3 million </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on a parcel of virtual land. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I, oh my God, I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is this what happens when
you just have too much money? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes.
- I think this is what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think what's happening
is that a lot of companies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> with a lot of money are like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's just throw something into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, your right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If it fails, doesn't matter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if it goes up tenfold big money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's what's going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think people in companies
are hearing whispers of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think I also, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I imagine as well that
Facebook is doing a really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good job at convincing these companies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That, that this is gonna be a big deal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When I feel like anyone
who is in the tech space, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looks at metaverse and is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I just don't see how
this can become a thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like good." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause how the fuck are
you gonna convince everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get a virtual headset? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you know how annoying they are to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love my tech </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I gotta admit virtual
reality headsets are a pain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the fucking ass.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, it comes with the assumption </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that virtual reality headsets </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> will be at one point more streamlined </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> than they already are, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which they really, really need to be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like the barrier of entry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for our virtual headset is like fuckin', </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oculus System has done great, obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is Facebook. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- And that is probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the most user friendly headset. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's still like, it's not perfect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not perfect, no, not at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You like you don't
wanna have a business, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I do not wanna have a business meeting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a fucking headset on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like honey, where's my headset? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Need to get into a business meeting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - One of the main pictures
of like the metaverse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you could have a
meeting with your coworkers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you had a virtual reality headset on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for more than two hours? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
- It is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have.
- I have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's awful.
- It's, you get sweaty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's bulky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The only reason why
I haven't done a stream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on my Oculus is because
I can't wear that thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for more than 20 minutes
without feeling sick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's also another, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It also depends on the game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I remember like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember hearing about these rumors </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that people get motion
sickness from where headsets. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Superstitions.
- Superstitions, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like,
- It's bullshit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're not sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm just like, they
must just be weak minded. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I ain't like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember like the first
time I got like my Vow Vindex, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the first games I bought
was like Pavlov, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or it was like the, it's like the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> basically a virtual reality CSGO. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I remember walking
in that for like 10 seconds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just got immediate
fuckin' motion sickliss </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, my brain searched through like my, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the entire history of humanity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like see if there was any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of experience that could like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> help regulate what I was going through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Nope, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what's going on right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You're just gonna, you're just
gonna feel sick right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] You're sick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like the thing is, I get motion sickness, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> even if it's like not a very like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movement intensive game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I get sick after like
20 minutes of Beat Saber. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like you're not
even moving in that game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm, I'm totally fine on
the Motion sickness part. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- I've only had one game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's given me motion sickness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or like, not even emotion, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like make me feel like, "Ooh." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like this ninja
game, Santiro or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- And like, you jump around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's pretty sick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But like you act, you jump in the air. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Really fucking high. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can change direction in the air </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again in any direction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh.
- So you can imagine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like jump up, fly
back and it's, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm getting sick, just hearing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But, it's good, but I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the thing that I have difficulty with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is these headsets are not light. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They are, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They are uncomfortable to wear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] They're bulky, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The index, I love the index. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Amazing quality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gray piece of hardware. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is heavy, and also
the wires can suck my dick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate the wires. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What I like about the
Oculus, there's no wires. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like the thing is
that I can't play a virtual </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or I haven't been able to
play a virtual reality game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more than a few hours before either like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my head gets tired or I
just want to chill out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just wanna like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause like I start sweating
a lot because you're wearing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I sweat a lot as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, you, you start like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean like you're basically
wearing a sink on your head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing)
- You're, you are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's that's basically
what it is, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pretty much, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like an entire bottle of this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Traps the heat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's it's not comfortable at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, I don't think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno if this is just
like boomer me talking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but I can't see it being a real substitute </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for just face to face interactions, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- to me at least </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Never, no it won't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean like, you know, again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like in order for the metaverse
thing to really pop off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it needs to be like, VR headsets
need to be common enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in every household as much as like say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a computer is today, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just don't see it
happening for a while. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Oculus isn't, it isn't quite there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's also expensive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] It is.
- You strap on these, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the Oculus is 300 bucks retail. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And yeah, that's steep
for a lot of people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think, you know, if you look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> at the progress we've made in the past, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what 10 years, when did
the HTC Vive come out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That was the first big one, wasn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the first big deal? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- When was that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When did the HTC Vive
get released, Ashley? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Can you have a look?
- [Ashley] HTC what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Vive.
- HTC Vive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought it was the Oculus
Rift was the first like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> real big one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the first one I heard about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was that like the one
that was with steam? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, that was, that was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - When did the Oculus Rift then come out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was like the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the OG Oculus Rift that was before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Facebook bought them, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Facebook bought them out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] The Steam Vive
was unveiled in March, 2015. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, what about the Oculus Rift. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oculus Rift?
- The original or yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the original OK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The original Oculus Rift was the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the rollercoaster sim. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought the HTC Vive was
the first time VR headsets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> became like, somewhat viable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh, like a thing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like to play games like, seriously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] Oculus was March, 2016. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, the Vive came out before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Vive was the, I dunno, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I could be totally wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't you could Google
what the first VR headset is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's fair to say at least, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to my memory at least </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that I think the HTC Vive
was the first headset </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that came out that like made gaming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seem like it made sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - On a, it wasn't just a gimmick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like, you could
actually play games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like SuperHot was amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Some of the demos are really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there were games coming out here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there that were, that
were pretty good as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now, I, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we thought there
was gonna be a big boom, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it, there really hasn't been, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That many games in the past seven years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just because the money
isn't there right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's so hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's so many barriers of entry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for buying like a VR game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So like the only big game I
can think of is Half-life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the only like, game where
I look at this VR game and, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It make sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - and it's like stands
up as like a game game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, it's like a lot
of games that I play on VR. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It seems like a tech demo with like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - it seems like a glorified tech demo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like Half-life
actually feels like a game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's because, you know,
Valve, like invested in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't even like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't believe they
made profit on it at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Like, because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like that was more of
just them flexing to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guys, we still make game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Remember, remember, remember? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We made games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We were fucking, we were a fucking amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game developer back in the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Well I play,
- We can still do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- We can still do, baby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We still got it, baby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I played a lot of games on the VR </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and Superhot is still
probably the best one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Superhot is the best one.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the game that I get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when people come to my house and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, you wanna wanna try, VR? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Super hot is the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that, I'm yeah, try this.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause it's so good.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's Superhot and Beat Saber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - which is the best VR
experience, I've probably had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, same here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So far. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's, I understand 'cause
like, setting up the Valve Index </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is like, it's the best headset, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you want performance and gaming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But, my God.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The cable, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is a fucking commitment, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - to set that thing up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And you nee a space big enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is another reason why it like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in Japan is like not popular at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think my problem with VR gaming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I've had so far is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it turns gaming for like, for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gaming is like a passive activity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mm.
- [Joey] Mm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But VR gaming is
definitely an active activity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for me, where I, you know,
you feel physically involved. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't feel passive, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do like that, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do like that as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like the, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you have like a fucking eight hour, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 10 hour gaming session, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to, that that's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I there's only so long I can have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can do something active. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- For that period of time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like to me, a lot of games
are a passive activity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where you sit down on the couch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or sit at your PC, you
just like chill there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And you just. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it also depends on like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the demographic as well, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, 'cause I'm sure like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the average 10 year old has
a lot more fuckin' energy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to move around for eight to 10 hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Versus like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> someone who's in like their 40s. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When I played a Gorilla Tag. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, on, VR? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - On VR, just all like 10 year olds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- It was all 10 year olds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well like, you know, I
think back to like when I was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think back to when I
was 10 and the fuckin', </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you remember the EyeToy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Oh, my God.
- The camera. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For PS2.
- For PS2. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like when that shit came out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and you had to like
physically move around and, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know that like as a 10 year old, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like, fuck yeah, I
could do this for hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you got me an EyeToy
now probably be like an hour </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a half and I'm done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but that to me, that
was always like a gimmick, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, like that
one time you go to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your cousin's house and
they pull out the DDR mat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're having a DDR night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pull out the virtual boy.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the shit mat
that like barely registered. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You got a fuckin' stamp on like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah yeah.
- You got pieces of foam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they were like break
after like one use or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a shame. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I think that like VR
gaming is some of the most fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and rewarding gaming out
there when it's done right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Problem is there's no incentive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for people to develop games for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's hard.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And also it's like, you know
when you're a kid and you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno if you've ever had them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno what they're called in Australia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But in the UK, the brand
calls like scale electrics. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like the, you know, those cars, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to lay out that track. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- And then you have the. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, hot wheels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe hot wheels,
- Kind of like hot wheels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You lay out the track </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you have those things that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, you turn the buttons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they go sroom, around the the fuckin' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what are they called in? What's
the generic name for them? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Ashley] I think you're right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Scale electrics on
like the fuckin' scales. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I always thought scale
electrics was a brand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Hot Wheels. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, I think it was a brand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm trying to know whether the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I only really play with Hot Wheels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh I, what was your point? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what VR feels like right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it needs to get to the point where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> current gaming is, where it feels like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, you put on the headset
and you're good to go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right.
- Right now it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I have to turn on the two base stations. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have to make sure all
the cables are plugged in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, I gotta install this update. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh the tracking's off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I gotta fix the tracking." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, it's such a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like going back to that feeling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as a kid where you set up
that track, you set it all up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Just for that like 30
minutes of enjoyment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then you gotta
put it all away again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like until it gets to the point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it doesn't feel
like a slog to set up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not that it's active. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's like a pain in the ass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to set up, and I,
- Oh, it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've got mine set up now to the point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's as painless as possible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's still a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I five minutes of
me turning everything on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and doing it all, is just
a little bit annoying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for my lazy gamer of brain
to want to do it well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, because you're so used to just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the turn on immediately start. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right.
- That makes sense, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] It's called
Scalextric that's the brand of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is there a generic name
for that kind of product or? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] I think was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - just motorized cars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Just like the, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you know how, like as a kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think we had a really dodgy one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was just a whole
event setting it up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It took so long, but. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but like you,
as I remember as a kid, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you had way more patience, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly what I'm saying.
- like not even as a kid, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but as a teenager as well, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, you know, I tell
people about the fuckin' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> efforts I had to go through to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even just fuckin' watch anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - or play some visual novels. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you had to like download
like 7 million zip files, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three tutorials about how
to like, install this game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm, I think back to that now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, man, imagine like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> imagine trying to do that now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where you can just press
one button on Steam to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> play a lot of these like
Japanese underground games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and all that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, even like console games, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you had to like
go into the bin to look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for the cartridge of the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you had to fuckin' put it in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, it's not working," pull it out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> blow on it a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Put it back in, turn
on, wait for it to load. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Now you just fuckin' turn on your switch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And the downloaded game is right there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- But like, I saw, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I have all my games cartridge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Oh really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause I give them to my like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> other people when I'm done with them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, Okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That makes sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like a big thing
that I've kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> felt recently is that like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've kind of like thought
what is the direction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that gaming is going to go, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What, because I've
recently procured myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a PlayStation 5. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I know.
- [Joey] Oh really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know guys, I know, I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, you're the lucky few. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, the lucky few. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the reason I did that was entirely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I was like, I'm not gonna, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't need a PS5, I don't need a PS5. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then Horizon Forbidden West came out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Horizon Zero Dawn were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of my favorite games of all time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm like, "All right,
this kind of deserved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the special treatment." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll try and go out my way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get a PS5 in order to play this game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the game looks fucking amazing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - and it's fantastic, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But is it that different
from playing it on a PS4? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wouldn't really say so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like hyper-realism in video games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has almost reached a limit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> To the point where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - we can't get any better graphics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Things don't look that much different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Than like eight years ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- They don't, they haven't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can't get any better than this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I remember jumping from like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember the first time I got my N64 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I played Super Mario 64 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like my mind fuckin' blew. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like, I was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I like running around in 3d
after 2d Mario all this time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I could not comprehend, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - How such an experience Could be done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 12 Year old me was
like, "Up is forward?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (heavy panting) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What, how does that work? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And now I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think there are extra pixels that I'm, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that my eye is seeing right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- I feel like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Unless you have like a 12K like TV, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're not gonna see the difference. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like it's a bit smoother </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause there are slightly more frames, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it certainly isn't
like the mind blown, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - kind of experience that I felt before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's what I'm saying like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why I feel like
we've almost reached </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that limit when it comes to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing graphically how games can be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's why I feel like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially the Indie
scene for the past like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 10 years has been more focused on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and making these more like stylized games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like pixel games and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like yeah, you know what I want back? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want cell shading in games back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can we have that back? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Has it ever left? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's like it used
to be in the forefront. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel, of like all the mainline games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like the main.
- [Connor] Is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In a way it was,
- I don't think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think for like certain
demographics, like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like when like Wind Waker
came out, for example, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone fuckin' hated it
at first until they played </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and they realized how
amazing it was, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember when everyone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when Wind Waker came out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and there was so much discussions in like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> magazines to be like, this is a step down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey giggling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this is a graphical step down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what the trend was, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was realism, realism, realism. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, realism, realism. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then when we started getting used </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the cell shaded shit,
like with what's it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Lollipop Chainsaw is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> another game series that's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very cell shade, very stylized, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - People are also like, oh man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this game looks too fucking weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's not pretty enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then people immediately,
when they played the game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they found out, oh, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is pretty, but just on a
different caliber of pretty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean like I would say like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wind Waker has aged the best
visually in terms of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I would argue like pretty
much every Zelda game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- You know? I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it looks better
than Pokemon Arceus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the best thing is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right?
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And the best thing is
those kinds of styles, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of the times are ageless. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like look at Cuphead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, or, yeah, exactly.
Or like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like Wind Waker looks just as good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even in today's standards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's so stylized. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas if you go back to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, Ocarina of Time, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, ooh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not as pretty as my 12
year old mind back then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ocarina of Time, was a fugly game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- It's not a pretty game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you have the context, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the setting and stuff
it makes perfect sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course, you know, people
who say like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with all those N64 games who
are like, "No, no, it looks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it looks just as good today." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are obviously, they're just
operating off nostalgia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like anyone can look at
Mario 64 and go, "Fuck me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's an ugly game." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Actually I think Mario
64 looks kind of good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You think, compared to like, Ocarina? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well , yeah like if you look
at something like GoldenEye. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> GoldenEye looks awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, that looks awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah, GoldenEye looks jacked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you know, and Ocarina
of Time, I think looks awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think Mario 64, like I don't know why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it looks okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think it aged as
bad as you might think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think you should probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> take a little closer look at it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have, I have, I have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bowzer looks like shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll give you that,
Bowzer looks like shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Peach in the opening
scene, I'm just like, Ugh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What is that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is true, actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I, 'cause when I, when
I think of Mario 64, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason I go to Mario Sunshine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because that was like, I
guess my childhood Mario. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember, and Mario Sunshine has aged </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot better visually than Mario 64. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A million times better, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because with, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like that generation of games like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - PS1?
- No, not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wouldn't say PS1, 'cause like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I look back at like Metal Gear Solid one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I look back at like,
pixels talking to each other, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like Snake's face, he doesn't
have detail, it's like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - One triangle.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just a triangle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember thinking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how the fuck did I get invested </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in these cutscenes of the Snake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going, "Otacon" and it's just
like a pixel going, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like I feel like
the PS2, GameCube era </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was kind of when we started
really, like really getting to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the point where I couldn't see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that much of a big jump
in graphical fidelity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah.
- And then afterwards </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I did see a difference with PS3. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> PS3 to me is when it kind of like peeked, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, where, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Last of Us originally came
out on the PS3, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes.
- And I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I, to me it like the original Last of Us, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like pretty much every game looks about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the same as Last of Us, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even though I could tell
they look graphically better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're not that much graphically better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I think, "My God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a fuckin' mind blowing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> amount of improvement," you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But Wii looks pretty bad though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Wii, well,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's because the Wii had like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very limited hardware. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In isn't in, isn't four AEP the Wii? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think so it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Has a native resolution of four AEP. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and it's a up scale. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it looks rough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you go back and play it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, "Oh." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I remember as a kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when Super Smash Bros
Melee, no Brawl came out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember, I thought, "Dude,
this is like the pinnacle." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought that with Twilight Princess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Connor] I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this is insane.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then I looked back like a year ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It looked like that the entire time? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think 'cause I'm remembering
the rendered cutscenes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for that game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the cutscenes look amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause of course they fuckin' do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. But I think in, with, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a case with that
generation of consoles, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the wii, I think it
depends on the game as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like Twilight
Princess still looks great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even though that's a Wii game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it still looks great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I haven't like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Compared to brawl. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think every single footage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've seen of tri princess of late </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> has been the HD Remaster. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The HD remaster, but if
you look at it comparatively, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a lot of these like HD Remasters, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really see the point
of calling them HD Remasters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause if you put them side
by side, they're really, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless you're like a fuckin',
you know, pixel snob, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you're not gonna see like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when Final Fantasy 10
Remaster came out, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the HD Remaster, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I played it and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how does this look any
different to the PS2 version? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, did you see the,
the GTA III Remaster? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh, it was a disaster. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like the game looked worse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you see this?
- I didn't see this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like a massive controversy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I didn't see this at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They like took off the
original Grant Theft Auto </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you couldn't buy it,
the original third one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they were like, "You
have to buy the remake." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They reversed it a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember exactly what they did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But they released this remake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it looked worse than the original. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like they just turned like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the smoothness option on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like everything had just been smoothed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, people just looked even
weirder in the cutscenes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ugh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And all of it looked,
have you not seen the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Naw.
- Okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> let me quickly grab a
few images and show you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna just type in Grand Theft Auto, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> GTA III Remaster images,
images, comparison. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Com par i son, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, so like, look at this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is the original and
this is the Remasters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Oh that's, that's
- [Joey] That's gross. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] That's just uncanny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] There's also like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there's so many where doesn't look like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that much better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- [Connor] It's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] I'd say the original
has more character to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, a lot of the cutscenes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the characters just look worse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- It was really weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I just don't understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's the thing with like, again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the thing with
like HD Remasters, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like when they see Remaster of Wind Waker, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "This legitimately
looks no different." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It still looks just as good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it does look a bit crisper. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ya think so?
- I'm not sure, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I,
- It's very minute, though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Thank you
- I would say, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you know, compared
to like Final Fantasy VII </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and final fantasy VII
Remake, by the way, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly.
- Like you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly like you that's a big job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's a big job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the difference
between remaking a Remaster. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's true.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, yeah, they just kind
of like uped the contrast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and smoothed it all out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and made it probably
just higher def, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, higher resolution,
but like it's so stylized, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so stylized though that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of like actual
graphical updates or upgrades, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like, it's not something
to write home about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, if you look at the image, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it just looks like the edges are smoother. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like RCX has been turned on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you're not gonna see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that big of a difference
when you're playing the game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wouldn't make a difference, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
- To your experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> playing the game.
- No, not at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, I guess
that's talking about like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the graphical differences as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but in terms like gameplay differences, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like the gaming industry
as a whole has just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> optimized pretty much like 90%
of everything thing they can, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that can be optimized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know, every, so
often we get something like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Breath of the Wild that completely changes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the way you look at like
an open world, for example. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- And now every open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> world game has a glider </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for some reason.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even if it doesn't need it, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well yeah, I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like the technology is less so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> focused on making the
things very high graphics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or making the textures more advanced. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, I think right
now a lot of the technology </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from what I understand is focused on like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the lighting and stuff, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, making it, so when you
put a character in a world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can add all of
the effects naturally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So instead of having a beam of light </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you programming
light, the light is here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like you program room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you have a
bunch of options to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> turn on the, I've forgot what the name </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the lighting thing is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like lighting where,
uses like the calculations, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like figure out what would happen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if like a ball went in the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - From the reflection stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that's where a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the advancements are being made. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not so much in like, the
individual like assets makeup, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the models that we
have of characters in games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are very, very high quality. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah.
- They are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They have been for a while. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the only thing that's left </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is making how the models
interact with the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> More realistic if they want that or, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, whatever they wanna do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so now it's about making the machines </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that can do these animations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or do these things built in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and do them smoother,
from what I understand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could be totally wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Someone might correct my comments. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I wanna know, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what's the, once we've perfected </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that hypothetically what's the next step? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's why I do look to VR, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I do remember the first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I tried Beats Saber, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the first time I tried Superhot, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I did get that same kind of feeling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I got playing Super Mario 64 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the first time, which is just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> your brain has never experienced
something like this before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's just fuckin' pure cocaine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like, the first time I
played Superhot VR was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the funnest gaming
experiences I've ever had, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like period. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Absolutely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like that was an hour or so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> However long time we play Superhot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's no big games in VR, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're all really good,
like one to three hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where's the next Mario's,
where's the Mario VR game, Dude? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna Mario VR game, where I am Mario. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Uses that, "Movement is limited," right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Movement, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You, if you let like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mario Kart VR, where's Mario Kart VR? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it could be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think there are a racing games in VR. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well they did it in Mario land. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So why can't they do it in an Oculus? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was not very good, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That wasn't very good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But,
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? Like if we get
like a Mario Kart VR. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think right now the point is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> movement is really hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And when movement is
realistic, it's not good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause that's not what you want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right.
- But also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you add unrealistic movement </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to your character, it becomes really hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to make it feel real, like
that thing I mentioned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where you jump around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't jump around, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just point the stick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and press jump. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you can't do that movement. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's no, I can't
jump in fuckin' my room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like an idiot, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wish I could. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know how bad ass that would be? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Jumping off the fucking walls. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna be on the
sidelines watching that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wish I could. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I will never get
bored of like the random </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for every like random clips like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that sometimes get
recommended of my YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of like grandmas trying VRs,
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the first time and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them doing like the balance beam game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, my God.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - and just like jumping
head first into a wall. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - People jumping and shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like that guy jumping
into his TV, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That was my favorite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I will never get bored with it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like the grandma who like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh I think it was a grandma or grandpa </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who did like the climbing one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and they like slowly fell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like they fell into
like a table or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you see those? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I know there's some places you can do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like an activity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> They, the VR headsets that
the cables go up to the roof. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's like a, a
treadmill you're standing on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like an Omni direction, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you can have a gun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you can like run around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- There's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know there's one place in Shinjuku, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think you can do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - With the treadmills? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] I think so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've done that as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck?
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know there's a few in America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- It looks really cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It looks really like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It looks really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like to try that out.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like imagine it's one
where it's like a trampoline, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that gives you like feedback </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> based on how much pressure
you put on the trampoline or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something, kind of thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like you're on gravity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the trampoline gets stiffer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And if it's like less, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're on like a swamp landing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes.
- like swampy, that'd be cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno how you do that, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause like I've
heard like one technique </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that people use to combat motion sickness </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in VR games, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is to literally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's drinking vitamin C. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Rubbing wasabi in their eyes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Eating a fuck ton of oranges, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> pouring some salt in their wounds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had to do it, I had
to do it, I had to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But also actually just like walking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like walking in the spot, you know like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like just literally, like
just moving your legs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to make you feel like you're walking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's just weird that that just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is enough, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Rewires your brain.
- Tricks your brain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into thinking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, okay, this is real walking, now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I can understand this, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never done that
before, I should try that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I should try that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean like it's VR right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now is at the very new stages. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm very interested to see how and like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if gaming gets to a point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where this kind of does become mainstream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we get some like actual, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> triple A games with VR games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause yeah, right now it seems like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a very overpriced piece of
tech for a lot of tech demos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a shame 'cause I really like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I really want it to evolve, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Um hmm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - but I don't think it's gonna be where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it would be really sick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and mainstream for like
another 10 years, at least. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just waiting, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I want sort out line. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hey, 40 year old me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna be jamming in
VR when it's out, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna be that dad that is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like doing his PC stuff
all the time, playing games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna be that dad for sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, of course, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're gonna be the generation
when we are retired, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're like, "Oh finally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can get started with my
back catalog of games." Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, aren't we
getting close to the year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that Sort out Line was set now, as well? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 2025, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean it could be done just like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know how I remember, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just like, just hook a
wire up to your like PC </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something that like electrocutes you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you die in the game, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you actually just like
gives you like a, like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like a shock collar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That gives you a lethal voltage, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you die in the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like we could just do, we
could probably do it now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We just don't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'cause we're scared
of what we could create. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] I'm sure there's something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're scared of
advancements in technology. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] 2022, for this year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, this year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually this year, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sort out Line, online
is this year, let's go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, my God. I actually you've read. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think they're releasing, like
someone's releasing an MMO. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> The first VR MMO. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, my God, it's real, it's real. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We can barely make good MMOs now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hope I get selected as a beater. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You, are a beater Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But yeah, I hate to date the video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but I just wanna talk about this one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I saw on Twitter this morning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's old news by the time this come out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So probably old news by
the time this comes out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I just couldn't fuckin' believe it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Snoop Dogg has joined FaZe Clan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What?
- I'm not even joking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He has joined faZe Clan as FaZe Snoop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay.
- What do you think about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I might be out of touch here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- What is a FaZe Clan? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Well like I know FaZe Clan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but I don't know FaZe Clan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What are FaZe Clan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like what is a FaZe Clan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's, you know, it's a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was originally a YouTuber organization. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now it's an eSport organization, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and then it, so they always had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it was back in the day
when Card started it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which, made it an Optic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- That's how it started. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I followed it then, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like they've seemed to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just gone out of that little bubble and, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't know what FaZe is anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are they just like a YouTube house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Or YouTube group? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's like a brand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know, if you, if
you're anointed into FaZe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anointed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Knighted into FaZe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You do get genuinely
get a lot of success </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just off the its a very powerful brand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - With younger audiences normally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not a lot of people
our age watch Faze much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are they still?
- 15, 16 something? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are they still an eSports organization? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, they do everything.
- Or are they? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kinda like a brand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, there's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's kind of what they're, that's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it like an agency? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so it's, from what I understand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's more of an agency. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right.
- But, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all of the eSports brands are all kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> going that way right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause they realize that relying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only on eSports is not
the best for business. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause you can, you
know, if your team competes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only four times, six
times a year, you have to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can only monetize the sponsors </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then those events. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Whereas, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you have an entertainer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you can monetize every time they upload </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or do something and take a cut. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean, now it just seems like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of eSports organizations are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just streamer organizations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause that's,
- Pretty much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what I feel with like with FaZe Clan now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, are they still
the eSports organization </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or are they an entertainment? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I always thought it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I always thought it was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, kind of like factioned off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Whereas like these, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like we have a bunch of
FaZe Clan members who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are like the eSports players </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who don't go on Twitch
or YouTube or anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then we have the YouTubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we have the Twitch streamers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well a lot of the time as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they want to get the, the
best players in a game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or a genre because normally
the best players at any game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if they stream, they
will have of an audience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Not necessarily always, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but they've a lot better
chance of getting an audience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - and you can, kind of help them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and coach them through it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, they're definitely
gonna get a bigger audience now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now that the Snoop D
O double G has joined. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For some reason when I heard that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, that doesn't
sound surprising to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno why, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Snoop does some interesting business. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Snoop does a lot of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure the deal is
very good for Snoop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, fuck yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure it's an extremely
good deal for Snoop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure he needs the money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, to me has the same energy of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> do you remember like back when, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when E3 happened and you'd see
like these press conferences </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then like at every
like E3 presentation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they'd be, they'd have this
like one random celebrity, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come on to promote their games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I don't know, fucking
Drake promoting Madden </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what I mean?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That it has the same
energy as that, for me it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It does, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where you just get like this random, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with this random celebrity
to promote your brand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or promote your game and
it wouldn't make any sense, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but you know, I just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it makes sense because it's so, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's such meme worthy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that people are gonna
talk about it anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And Snoop Dogg has done plenty of shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, he's so a amazingly in touch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with like internet audiences </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and just meme culture that like he's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just like a win for him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just, I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's just something weird about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Something weird about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well he's always posting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We'll have to call him FaZe Snoop, now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's always posting on Instagram </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and stuff and all that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Remember he like doxxed his
Uber driver or something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What?
- He like doxxed his like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> delivery or door dash person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Because they didn't like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> deliver the food.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He like showed a picture
and their first name </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to all of his followers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause he was showing the interaction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- He was angry that he, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think Snoop Dogg was upset </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that they didn't deliver the food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think Snoop was trying
to tell him where to go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- To deliver. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ' Cause he Snoop lives in
like a gated community. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's probably bit
harder to give it to him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he was like
complaining on his Twitter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and showed the face </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and name of the person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this guy got like
a lot of hate, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jesus,
- Poor guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - poor guy.
- Yeah, but, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It just, it, for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like really fascinating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just watching these like very
traditionalist celebrities </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and like music artists and whatnot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like kind of really dig their
heels into things like Twitch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and YouTube and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah.
- You know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when I found out
like, you know, T-Pain, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> regularly streams on Twitch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he has like a pretty
fucking massive audience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - T-Pain streams on Twitch? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. T-Pain, T-Pain is
massive on Twitch, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like he's been streaming constantly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like everyone wonders, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, what happened to T-Pain?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's on Twitch now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's just streaming on
Twitch, like deadmau5 as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He's just streaming on Twitch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, I know deadmau5
is streaming on Twitch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really bizarre that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at least I find it very bizarre </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to see these like,
people you only ever see, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Traditionally?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The people you'd only
ever see on like TV shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and like music videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just suddenly being looked at. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] You know, let me look at, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I just dropped a $5 donation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to T-Pain the other day
on Twitch, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is weird to say out loud, I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] T-Pain stream,
he's streamed 1500 hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's got the analytics up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's, I'm looking at, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Real streamer boy, here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - His, he's active
normally one day a week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - One day, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And normally he seems
quite wild, I think actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure he is busy doing other things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure he stream more than me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right.
- He streams more than Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he streams more
than me, I'll tell you that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh wow yeah, he's quite active. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was surprised, I just randomly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I remember I was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> going through Twitch one day and you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the channels issue, watch thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, came up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and on the top of it,
it just said, "T-Pain." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, that can't be
the same T-Pain, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the guy who wrote, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Through the Fire and Flames?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The guitarist? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, the guitarist for
DragonForce something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He streams on Twitch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The guitarist and the
drummer actually stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Really regularly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember they wanted
to perform their song, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but they couldn't for copyright reasons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that sounds like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - sounds like the age of the internet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause Copyright laws are broken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, no, like I remember like when, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They'll get DMCed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They would, they would. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When like Gordon Ramsey replied to xQc </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - about the cooking thing,
that was so surreal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What a weird, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think the that's Gordon Ramsey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty sure that's just
someone managing his account. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think Gordon has very good people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in charge of his accounts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because Gordon's pretty
active on like TikTok, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's pretty active on like
social media platforms. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I Feel,
- I have to doubt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that he's he's keeping up with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think Gordon is a
very good team of zoomers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, yeah.
- coaching him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and telling him what to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause again, and one of his videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he just kept talking about uncle Roger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you obviously have someone who's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> keeping you in touch
and telling you who's? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, obviously, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> We've talked about how
whoever they've hired </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like the, "Kitchen
Nightmares" titles on YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Top 10 times the food was busing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Kitchen Nightmares," like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That was like an actual
YouTube title, like happening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it worked, it worked, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it got so many fuckin' views, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Even though it's like a decade
old show now or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I tell you the people
running his accounts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The most cursed title. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - are like on top of that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't even wanna know how much the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Kitchen Nightmares" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTube account makes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I've noticed as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the YouTube, "Kitchen Nightmares" account, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally just reposts the same
clips with different titles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and different montages all the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They'll be like top 10
times the burger was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I'll, the next one will be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> top 10 times the food was good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they'll just reuse the same clips. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So they just keep making different lists </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then reusing the same clips. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it's finite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's only, they don't have, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - more than what they have now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's genius, though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But somehow they've been daily uploading </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and keep uploading stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's genius though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because whenever, I dunno about you guys, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but whenever a, "Kitchen Nightmares," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Clip shows up my timeline there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I always got time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I all, even if I've seen this clip like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 10 million times before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, all right, how
busing is it actually? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I gotta find out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Kitchen nightmares." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's about 10 times
man, the food was busing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I think another one was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when the food wasn't busing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> top 10 times the food wasn't busing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Kitchen Nightmares" gets on average </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or fluctuates from anywhere </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between 30 to 70 million views a month. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Holy shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, that's probably
in the range of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it could be anywhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from like 100 to 200 grand a month. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well yeah, knowing how well
food channels do, especially, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's probably 200,000, 200,000 plus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's probably on the higher end. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is what, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which makes me wonder
why don't more reality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> TV shows post as many fucking clips </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as they possibly can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Probably because a lot of
their production team are out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of touch or maybe some copyright issues. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably a mixture of things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Also probably a lack of
faith that they'll do well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, the "Kitchen Nightmares" brand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is still very strong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, what show were you
thinking of specifically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like pretty much any reality TV show? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like,
- Like "Big Brother?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Big Brother" like "90
day fiance," you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like and any basically
anything made by TLC, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like fuckin' "the Bachelor,"
like shit like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I feel like reality TV
in like, especially reality TV </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was meant to be watched in a group. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, TLC uploads clips, all the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why they're so,
they could do so well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause they upload all the
clippable moments to YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well that's how "90 day
fiance" got big to begin with, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's because the clips went viral. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would like, I wonder
if it would do even better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on like, if they not only
uploaded whole episodes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like uploaded whole
episodes, uploaded clips, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uploaded like fuckin' montages, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like with the "Kitchen nightmares" things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it feels like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this kind of content is
just infinitely recyclable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because it's content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you're gonna fuckin' watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever you have like a lunch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you need to sit down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're like, what
clip do I want to watch? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, maybe I'll just watch
"Kitchen Nightmares." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe I'll just watch "90 Day Fiance," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> again the same "Big Ed
Clip" or whatever, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You never get tired
of those "Big Ed Clips." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You'll just never get
tired of that, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The clip of somebody
who's over like 600 pounds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, or someone
with like a gross, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, obsession or. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Coffee enema. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like smelling butt holes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thank you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it like, what was that show? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like my weird, my obsession, my? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "My Strange Addiction." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - "My Strange Addiction," yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The one of other coffee
enema gets me every time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there's no way someone actually does that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like gross. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The one thing that
makes me cringe the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason is the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there was this one British
woman who eats concrete. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Who eats bricks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it wasn't the fact that she, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just better than British food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is a British delicacy, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Developing a strong
jawline with that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You told me, they were
like, why do Legos have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Do not eat" warnings
and British food doesn't? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was the argument? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, it was just like the noise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that it made when she was crunching. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, God, did she,
- I can hear it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have any teeth left? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably filing them down slowly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like you know that feeling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where you accidentally
get sand in your mouth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just the worst for? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like Anakin Skywalker,
like millions atrocities. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That feeling alone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That feeling, I understand Anakin, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - for that one moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you accidentally
get sand in your mouth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you just spend the next
five minutes, just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, there's just a weird crunch in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't get rid of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think maybe the reason
why like a lot of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, shows like
that, reality TV shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't post clips and full episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's because a lot
of their, like, I dunno, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is just speculation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm guessing a lot
of like the producers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the production team </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the people behind the actual show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> still have some level of faith </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that people still watch TV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like they used to back in the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Mm hm.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so they're like, well, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're still getting numbers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe not as big as you
know, back in the aughts, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know, people still watching TV. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I also imagine that maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're producing a lot of shows, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I imagine there has been a lot of shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just lost 'cause they
didn't archive them properly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or they didn't, they don't have the files </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or they have them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They just dunno what, which ones, which, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I Imagine there's a
lot of that going on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably copyright, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like maybe the production team made it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then sold it to a network </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and maybe the network
doesn't have the rights </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the production team doesn't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe they also don't have
the rights for the and, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm sure they didn't
build those contracts, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the cause of like, oh, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if these go on YouTube,
then we hold all the rights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure they do now a
lot of networks probably do, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I don't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but like a show
from the two thousands? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Probably not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I notice right now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> especially like whenever
I go on my Netflix, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> holy fuck they make a
lot of reality TV shows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like with every single genre, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I remember when Netflix kicking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, pick an occupation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there's probably a
reality show around that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A glass blowing one,
you watched that one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, there's a glass blowing one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a glass blowing like course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course there is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - there is like competition. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched that the full series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did they have like, the
reality TV like interviews? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like "Master
Chef" with glass blowing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they had like the archetypes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the glass blowing judges. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were like the, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the Gordon Ramsey, the an nice one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the mean one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't believe he just
said that about my vase. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it like exactly the same format </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and everything like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but like you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now 30 minutes to make your glass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It is literally like master chef, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but replaced with glass blowing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't that bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] Is it called blown away? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, blown away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Blown away.
- Blown away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - How many seasons it got now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] It's got, hold on, let me see. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Probably two, two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember when like Netflix was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just shitting out like
five documentaries a day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and now they're like shitting out five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different reality TV shows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I not as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Glass blowing got a season two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and "No game, no life" didn't? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what the fucks wrong with people? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm surprised that
like every single death </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in the US hasn't had a
docu-series at this rate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like everything has been
covered at this point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just don't, it's crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I watched one the other day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about like some grandma who was
killing people in her house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And, and I was like how are
they finding this stuff? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who's finding this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> This is insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why was this not televised earlier? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like I should know about this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Grandma killing people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This feels like a TV show plot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If this happens on TV
would be like unrealistic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously you don't watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> enough True Crime documentaries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or True rime podcasts or channel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well it's just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The True Crime podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like been there, done that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've been there, done that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I feel like there's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This basic.
- the obsession. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes you're watching True Crime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, and then you
just get this moment of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your, your consciousness going, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Don't you think it's weird
that you're watching stories </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about people being murdered
and just shoving cameras in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> their face and in
interrogating people to tell us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how they felt 20 years ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when their family member died?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, do you not get
that when you watch it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like I get these
moments, I'll watch a full series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I won't get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every now and then I'll
just watch a series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's always with the family interviews </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> makes me think, why are they just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> making these family members just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking talk about this
shit and cry on camera. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're like, 'I loved him and stuff." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like, it's genuine, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I feel like these poor people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who like didn't ever wanna
talk about this again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have just been shoved with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause they probably,
when someone was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Here's 10 grand talk
about your dead cousin." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And how they were close to you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and how it was suspicious that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that one guy who never
got caught was suspicious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, that brutal Myrtle, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you saw in front of your eyes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> recall that word for word. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's just the same formula as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It feels like we've turned
it into a sort of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Glorification? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we've glorified
murder and stuff and, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's scary isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like, because Sydney, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've talked about this before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but Sydney listens to a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know, I know.
- a lot of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she loves it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> True Crime videos, True Crime podcast, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever like she's doing her make-up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like every so, every. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The time he discombobulated him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Her arms were cut off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Her legs were cut off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And every so often I'd be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then David trapped Sally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in her basement for two weeks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and brutally (beep) her before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (beep) her (beep) and her. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But before I get to next point, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd like to bring up my sponsor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for today's video, NordVPN. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, "Bra,
what is this right now?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, like I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you know, like the, you know, Nexpo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't wanna end
up like Sally, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You should get NordVPN. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno if these guys, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even know if Nexpo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or I know rainbow has sponsors and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's totally, I understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I get it.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you have to admit
like, it is a little jarring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is, it's so jarring </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when I just about this like story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love the channels, by the
way, I love your guys' video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Brilliant channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But there's but there's right
and wrong places to put it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno, it's so weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think there's ever like a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unfortunately the topic I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just doesn't lend well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just doesn't lend well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like there's been weird transitions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, we've done very, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> many weird transitions in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure, in our careers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've like just
transitioning to a sponsored </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we've had for this video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We had the, the Berserk
thing one time, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We were talking about the passing of? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mira.
- Mira. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And because the way that we recorded it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was an ad break that was put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right in the middle of us talking about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not our finest work.
- Yeah, not our finest, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There is 'cause of how
we should have caught it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - unplanned and something
that we looked over, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- But there's, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not any like True
Crime, True Crime YouTubers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there, I dunno, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think it is there is a right way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to transition from some of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the stuff they talk about
to an advertisement. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every time I hear it, it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it just takes me out for a second. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like, we've, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> In a way I, it's totally fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't think it's like bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not condemning in any, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I'm not condemning it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like, I like the content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like, you have to admit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes you're watching
it and you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it is strange how we've
turned this into like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like the common day watch mojo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Like we've turned in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the we've turned
murders into what we, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like top tens used to fill, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, whereas top 10 used to fill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I'll just put
anything on kind of thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We just like murder and horrible acts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just let it fill the void somehow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like there's a like channels and I'm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm surprised watch a murder
hasn't gone into that yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> There's like top 10, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like girls who've been
trapped in dungeons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's probably is some.
- Probably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know that there's people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who do their make-up and
talk about True Crime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's a common. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I've seen that a lot, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is also a strange
evolution, but impressive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, get ready with me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> while I talk about this horrible murder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's,
- It's a cool evolution. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like next level mukbang, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> They're just, they're doing makeup </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're talking about True Crime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna see a mukbang </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where they talk about True Crime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as they're like, just demolishing a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hear you're saying this,
I bet it already exist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It probably exists. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't give Nikocado Avocado
anymore ideas, man, don't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro, come on, Nikocado is
publishing a live True Crime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Whatever he's doing to his
body is True fucking Crime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a True Crime
documentary to happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's True Crime what he's doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to his digestive system, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I mean, again like
I watch a lot of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I consume a lot of it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I do just get those
moments where I'm like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, the reality hits, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, It is weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Especially where, like I thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about it the other day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, I don't know anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in my immediate circle or relatives </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything where somebody has had like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something really horrible
happen to them or a murder. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, do you know anyone? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a cousin who knows
someone who's been murdered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- Not when it comes to murder. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- And like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this True Crime stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> almost kind of like normalizes it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in your mind, I feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that this is a
normal thing that happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - When in actual fact
isn't normal, at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think it normalize it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just desensitize you to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah well, I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it makes you think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it is a normal thing that happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really, I've never heard of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never listened to True Crime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and thought it was a
normal thing that happened. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like you watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> These are real people, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - These people, these interviews, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this could be your cousin,
this could be your mom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like,
- I think it's the gravity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at which they address </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that particular topic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like, they say like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh yeah, so Tim got murdered." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like in the same tone as like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "So, I met up with Bob
the other day," you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's like, I think, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The, I think the gravity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of the situation is often lost. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- In the content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because there's so
much content like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's the, the content is King and the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not saying that I want to sit there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and feel traumatized every single time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I watch something about True Crime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just think it's kind of interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and worth talking about the fact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we don't consume it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and we don't empathize,
necessarily, always. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it is entertainment in a sense, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right.
- It is entertainment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We don't watch it to
really, how can I say this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Really, we don't watch
it to not sympathize, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but we don't watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - People don't watch these
kinds of documentaries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and cry at the end of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- Is what, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like they don't, they're not like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh my God, I feel so sad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for these like families,"
start shedding a tear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We watch it out of morbid curiosity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is what I was trying to say.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, there's, there's a
sense of morbidness to where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we want to know the gross details. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - How far does morbid
curiosity go, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the question?
- That's the question. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, that's when you start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> getting into the weird shit, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that's the part where
it's like, "Oh, okay." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To the point where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you liking True Crime documentaries, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's nothing compared to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> some of the weirder stuff you're into. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes I wonder like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do I think I'm consuming
this content wrong? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I've watched some things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where it'll be like a documentary </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it'll be like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a kid got like beat up by his parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and no one helped him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then the kid died and it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have to like stop for the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, I have to like take a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have to like of just
step back and be like, fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't do anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then people will
watch like tons of these. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, I'm wondering like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what are they experiencing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's different from me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Like that makes it so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I walk away from this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just feeling drained and exhausted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then like, "Ooh, next one." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, one thing, I found really, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just wanna know
like, cause I'm curious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, one thing that I
found really interesting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that Japan doesn't have
any programming like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, they don't, they
don't, I've noticed that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And and I think it's because, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like taboo.
- Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is taboo to like bring it
back up and talk about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And especially like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't imagine a fuckin'
TV program being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Knock, knock, Hey, your son
got murdered 10 years ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Can you talk about it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Tell us about it.
- Like, you know, like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they wanna respect the families, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, not saying that, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all of these like True
Crime documentary makers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> have no respect on the
families or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it is scarily like, it is scary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It feels invasive at times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It does feel invasive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It feels very intimate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and it's scary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that no one who watches that kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> programming second guesses, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- that invasiveness. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But also I understand
maybe if somebody was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> your family was murdered, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can also understand the opposite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Where being able to talk about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and express your frustration, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Maybe gets it off your chest? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - can help you get like grief </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and help you kinda get
the story out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you feel like I've told my case. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've told people what it is and, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] And I'm sure, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I get both sides, I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm sure you know,
the ones who think that, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if I just talk about it on camera </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and get it off my chest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and let people hear it,
would make me feel better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Are the ones that turn into documentaries. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why kinda get worried with these. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sorry, I've interrupted like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three times in a row now Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Final time, I promise, I promise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Unprofessional. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't even remember what I said. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like twice, the time I had like a point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and was gone and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh man, I have another point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But gonna be like, "Connor,
let Garnt fucking speak!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, that's another
thing addressed in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think a I few of them
here and there is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is where I start to get a bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weirded out with True Crime is when, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as the True Crime investigators online. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That go around and then start, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pushing buttons and sending emails </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and asking people questions
who don't wanna talk about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- It's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think people have a right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mentioning keyboard warriors,
keyboard investigators. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Amateur detectives. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like what was that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh fuck, what was that one where that guy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Ah, shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which one was it? There was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this guy was like the head
detective for the online. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And do you know what, have
you watched this with? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Sydney's probably
definitely fucking watched. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I gotta ask Sydney. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't fuck with cats? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That the only one I know where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was actually a good one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But there's been
another one where a guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's just like a four
chain user or something? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I need, I don't feel
confident saying about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to go and check. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Which one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was on Netflix, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's one where this
guy was basically like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like in charge 'cause the police
weren't helping that much, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but the police have to
go through, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> systems and, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They don't always do
the best job, obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] But they have to
go through the procedure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But this guy kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> steamrolled in and was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll help you family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll be the detective. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was kind of weird watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this documentary and watching this guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What was the family like?
They were like, oh yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They liked it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause we, because they
were vulnerable spot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, this guy was selling them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the thing that I can help, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's not cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I think the guy genuinely
believed he could help. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think it was a scam or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause there was no money involved. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was like, I will help you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But, it just felt kinda weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, I was about to say
if like, if he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll help you solve the
case, give me some money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, he was like an internet guy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's just really into True Crime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was going about being
like, I will solve this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll help you do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck, I need to figure out what this is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I have such a vivid image of this guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno, do you think that's
morally correct to do or? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It might have been. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno, it really
depends on the situation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because was this guy diluted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or did this guy actually help out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno, what grounds, I guess what, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from what Connor has described, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what grounds did he
have to come to a family </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and was like, I can
solve this crime for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did he want the clout? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, so the next time
he's on a True Crime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> he was like, "So, you might
have heard of this case. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh that was me." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's from, "Tiger King 2." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's this guy who was like, "Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm definitely certain that
Carol Basking killed it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll help the family and stuff." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just, like this guy's
clearly just inserting himself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- In this situation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He just wants to be
part of the storyline. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just, it was just
like, I just, just, I, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, just leave
it up to the professionals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I get too invested
in True Crime stories, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is why I've never fully
like been into True Crime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because like, I would hear some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the stuff that Sydney
listens to or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And sometimes they like actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> play like the 911 call </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is made about this crime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I hear this shit and I'm like take, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like fresh out of the shower </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ready for my day or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I got like a kid
fucking crying on the phone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> telling like, the police that
her mother's been murdered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then you immediately
feel dirty, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just like, "Sydney, I wanna cry now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Can we not listen to it?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - She's just like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Uh huh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And we're not trying to imply </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that if you do consume this stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've no empathy or, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] No, no, no, of course not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, this is just
like, I get too invested in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just wondering like why,
like why is it different? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like how far have you guys gotten </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with like your morbid curiosities, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the internet is a wonderful, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but sometimes a terrifying place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you can see
anything you want to see. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yes.
- Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I know a lot of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and a lot of kids went through a phase </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where they stumbled upon like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the darker side of the internet, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I'm not even gonna
pretend to sugar coat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the fact that like, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, at one point
when I was in high school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone was like, "Do you know
of this thing called Tor?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "No, what's that?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I downloaded it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, it's a gateway to the dark web. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know, I spent an
afternoon, one afternoon on tour, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, going through the dark web </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just to see how fucked up it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and can confirm that's some
fucked up shit on there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause like, for me like, I like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't do anything, mind you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey incriminates
himself on, "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't do anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just, I saw a lot of things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I probably shouldn't have seen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like even to me,
like my, my baseline, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could not go on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, if I see a LiveLeak thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm clicking off that video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no.
- Mmm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just, I just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never had that kind of part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of myself where I was morbidly curious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> enough to see something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I probably would regret seeing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can live the rest of
my life not seeing this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've seen the worst things on Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's, I'll be honest you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's some fucked up shit on Twitter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm, the most fucked
up videos I've ever seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> have been on Twitter.
- [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually, that's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Some really fucked up things, and I'm, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought you were just
like being facetious there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought you were,
- No, no, genuinely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought you were just
like, oh, I had this tweet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I saw the other day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like friends, like people who I followed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I knew they'd like retweet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and be like, "Oh, this is horrible." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This video of like some
people getting shot and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've seen that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Why are you sharing this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've actually seen that, as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought you were being
factious, too, being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I saw the tweet the other day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that said that Dimas is better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I said, "Oh my God, horrendous." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That too, that too, that too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We thought you were
taking the piss there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can, I, you know, I've, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know exactly (indistinct), </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - the pre 2010 era of the internet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where everyone loves
sharing fucked up shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, of course.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When Reddit 50/50 was the King. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Definitely saw the most haunting stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being shared on Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Twitter is very slow
to get rid of this stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it is, it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe not as good as other platforms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> at getting rid of it and yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the fucked up shit there man I, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Some of it's still burned into my mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never been on the dark web. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't really have an interest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Weirdly enough, like the
stuff I saw on the dark web, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like, just based on like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what you see as an image </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever is not as fucked up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as some of the stuff you'd
see on like Reddit or Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it like second page of Google? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No one talks about kidding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I think it's just
like, I think it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the thing that's like fucked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about the dark web from my experience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on going on it, it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's conceptually a
lot of fucked up things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like when you read
into it, it's like, "Oh." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought it's just people buying drugs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey sputtering) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's like 90% of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like the tip
- People selling Ft, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The tip of the iceberg, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, there's but like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like a lot of
other stuff you'd look into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like, oh, where it's like, "Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I probably didn't wanna know
that that was an operation that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is currently functioning right now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's some were out there
in the world, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the levels are fucked up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas like you go LiveLeak and Twitter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, you're immediately
exposed to something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like, "Oh, that's oh,
I shouldn't have seen, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't wanna see a guy's
head explode on LiveLeak, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I just did." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it is just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's one of the few times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that a video like that or pictures, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> gone through the cracks, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's never not been haunting for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like every way, shape, form. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I remember every
fucked up thing I see. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I see it once, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "That is now like fucking
ingrained in my mind." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there'll be a point
where I'm in the shower. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I have like a fuckin'
flashback to that video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, my day is just infinitely worse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's a part of me there where like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know this is a reality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I know like the internet is filtered. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So,
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is more friendly, but like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a part of me where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to be desensitized
to this thing, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I know I've met some
people who are just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you think that's baby shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've seen the real shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've seen the fucked up shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen the Snuff films. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why, why, why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm just like, well, to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I like being sensitive
to this stuff, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Because this shit is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It grounds me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, this shit grounds you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like the True Crime stuff as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like, to me, at least like to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want to be too
desensitized to the group, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the True Crime stuff in case, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this happens in my real life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I know someone that has, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that happens to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- I don't wanna be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> desensitized to that, in my mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So let's be real, like you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if some person comes up to you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and says like, "Oh well,
that's, that's some pussy shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen the more fucked up stuff." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, that's not a brag. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like why do you think you're cool? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you see like a
bunch of LiveLeak videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're not phased by it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, I wanna
leave, I wanna get away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like that doesn't make, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not gonna make me be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh my God, what an
absolute fucking Mega Chad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this guy is for like sitting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through a bunch of LiveLeak playlists." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, no, that just makes
me not want to be near you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you're fucking weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Isn't LiveLeak shut down now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes.
- Has it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I believe it has. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really, since, when?
- Dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What a good thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Damn, missed out, just kidding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So much good content lost forever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, no, it's horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like, because
there was, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> especially during like the peak
of like Reddit 50/50, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah, oh God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like the mid 2010s. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Remember when that was the craze. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you wanna explain
what Reddit 50/50 was? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I, I don't, I kind of don't want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I don't want people going onto it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it still a thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pretty sure it's still a thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's still a thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but Reddit 50/50 is
basically it's this Subreddit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where people post this
like, link where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like you have a 50/50 chance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you click the link of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a really nice thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or it's a really bad thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And when I say nice and bad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean like really nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and like the worst NSFL
shit you will ever see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like straight from LiveLeak. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So there's, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an example would be like Reddit 50/50, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five cute puppies or
five decapitated heads. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you won't know which one it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until you click the link. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And in the 2010s, that was a game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> People, like kids used
to, to play, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I remember some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my fuckin' high school friends were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, in a Skype call
back in the day was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You want do a little
bit of Reddit 50/50?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> As if they're inviting me to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a Minecraft server, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, it's like, yeah you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just casual gaming, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Oh gosh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you know, poor naive
me the first time around, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, what's Reddit 50/50? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Biggest mistake in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did that for five minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, I don't wanna
talk to you guys ever again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for letting me sit through that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause that was horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, and then it became a
big thing on fuckin' YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, which is why I
feel sorry for like the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of the worst jobs I could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine is the people who work for, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Moderate, Reddit 50/50. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Moderate Facebook and stuff, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have to go through every
video that's been flagged. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Facebook or in YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was a video I saw of like some, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it, I saw, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was a vice video I saw.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of like, like one of these people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who had been interviewed and, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And some of the shit they
had to like, go through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Awful man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That job seems like
the worst job on earth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just like completely desensitized. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like just hearing them talk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They just like, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But apparently, obviously
you'd have to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go through a bunch of
really horrific views </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and really fucked up,
really ripe opinions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I think, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A lot of them apparently, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a lot of them would
like get really desensitized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and become like really fucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> The more they did this job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I think it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that vice documentary where
like the girl said that like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh yeah, once you
apply for this position, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just like, immediately
like, get therapy." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like it just comes with the package. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Awful, awful.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It comes with the package </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that there is a therapist,
maybe on site, maybe online. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, but. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What a terrifying thought. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a job out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that immediately requires
you to have therapy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well kind of like you,
they need the like they're, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they're the fucking real heroes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause there needs to be someone out there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that makes the fuckin' internet safer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for people like us that don't wanna see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that on our timeline. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Otherwise, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's the difference
between the normal web </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and the dark web at that point, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just exactly the same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just hope they get
treated fuckin' fairly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and treated well and getting paid well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hope they get the best, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause that's a horrible job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hope they get the best
fuckin' therapist on the planet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's sad. That's
the sadder thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If they don't have the
best fuckin' therapist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on the planet, like Jesus
Christ, I, it's not worth it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Didn't mean to make the ending
of the podcast that morbid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We went through some weird topics. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like I say that
every episode, though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, "What a
weird Episode that was," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was a weird tangent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It wasn't, you know, sometimes
you go, you tangent on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to a happy end and
sometimes you tangent on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the weird and dark ends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and unfortunately or not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was one of the podcasts
where tangents into, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey man, that's the
appeal "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You'll never know what
we're gonna talk about next. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You never know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sorry, we'll talk about
shit again the next week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Just to brighten things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't talk about shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just,
- I just shit myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Speaking of bright spots though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> look at these patrons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Look at that.
- They make us happy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They bring us smile to our face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They make me forget
about the horrible shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I saw on the dark web. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So thank you for that.
