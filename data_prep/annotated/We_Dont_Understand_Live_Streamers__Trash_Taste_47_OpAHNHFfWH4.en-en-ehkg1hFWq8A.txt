<SPEAKER_00> - Can you be cancelled for your dreams? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Would you rather utter
a racist word asleep, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or shit yourself?
- I'd rather shit myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd rather shit myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I will poop myself on stream for $100,000. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - A new Trash Taste
shitting special, let's go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (relaxed music) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's up Tomato Town,
welcome back to another episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of "Trash Taste Podcast" . </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're referring to, there's
no one in Tomato Town, Joe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ah, shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're wiped out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're talking to nobody,
Joe. You're talking to nobody. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's gonna be real awkward
if this meme is dead. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> By the time this comes out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, we'll bring it back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Knowing how fast memes fucking recycle, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's pretty obvious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I will be singing Chug Jug
until the end of the year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I swear to god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I doubt that. I put money on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - By this time next month, everyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> will be like 'what is a chug jug?' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Anyway, I'm your host for this week, Joey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the boys Connor and Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And we will not be talking
about Fortnite memes today. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, you know me.
I'm a pro Fortnite gamer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, this is like,
literally the meme of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, you know the three children sitting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on the couch, like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'What's your favourite Fortnite meme?' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's the title of that
video again? It's like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You are nearly 40 years old, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what is your favourite Fortnite meme? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's the title of that video again? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've forgotten what it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its like, its something
about Fortnite right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, you know when you see, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a meme picture and you just have no idea </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the original context
of that picture is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, there's so many
pictures that I recognise </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I have no idea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - One that I wanna know is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what's the context of that picture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like, you know the
dude sitting next to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the three pictures of like,
the people having a podcast? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna know the
context of that, because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we see that all the time on our subreddit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're not gonna be
talking about that. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we're not gonna
be talking about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Not gonna
be talking about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're gonna be talking, today, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about YouTube stuff? I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Twitter stuff? I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Twitter stuff? Just internet stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well I think there's been a few recent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> interesting things that
have happened, but. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - As recording. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we're recording not any more, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because we're having a
bit of a two week break </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of recording, so it's gonna be, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, six weeks from
when we talk about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This'll be all news by the
time you guys are seeing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, yeah, so, as of us recording this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think, was it two days ago? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - YouTube, the official
Twitter account on YouTube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> announced an interesting update? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] They are testing
to see whether they should </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get, just, get rid of, well testing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Which, when YouTube
starts to test something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 90% of the time it goes through. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, they are testing to see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> if it's worth getting
rid of dislike button. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wait, not getting rid of
it, but getting rid of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Getting rid of how many dislikes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are publicly seen on video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Essentially. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I hope they, its
gonna be real awkward </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if they revert it by
the time this comes out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean I just hope. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, even if they revert it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I do want them to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I will say on the record now that I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> its a fucking stupid idea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, just in recent memory, what's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the only things that I can recall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that YouTube backpedaled on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was the verification thing, where, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Verification thing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like, a year and a half ago, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or two years ago, they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Umm, no one's verified anymore.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, that's right! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'and only select
channels can be verified.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh I think it's only
music channels, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - People with like, 10 million subscribers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weren't like, eligible or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was like, what, who the fuck </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can be verified then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was that, and then there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the YouTube Heroes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was the end of end as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my fucking god,
I've completely forgotten </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about YouTube Heroes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That wasn't like, last year? Was it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, that was like, four years ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What was YouTube Heroes, again? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was basically where
they were gonna, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> let people be, like, moderators, in a way? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. That was it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it was their answer to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Twitch Mods. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also just calling it 'Heroes' is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there are heroes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, as the heroes of anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, but. There's just
been, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel, especially, with like, these. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We were talking about it
before this podcast started. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But, I feel that, when
YouTube suggests a change, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or an implementation to the system, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> its not so much a suggestion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Its more like, 'hey so,
no one asked for this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we're gonna tell you right
before it starts happening, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but this is what's happening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you disagree with it, LOL sorry.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah they also tested,
one time, as well, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just getting rid of people's thumbnails, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that was a thing, remember that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no, no, it was like, the
animated thumbnails, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like, where the previews, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, nowadays on
YouTube I think its like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if you hover over a video thumbnail, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then it plays, like, a preview? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of the video? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But before, yeah, I remember this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were gonna get rid
of the idea of thumbnails, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just replace it with
the previews of thumbnails. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if that was the intention, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I could be wrong, but I just remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there was a period where I would just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> log on YouTube, and, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everything was moving? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, everything was moving, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or there was just no
thumbnails for anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I found out later it was because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of this YouTube test they were doing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on like 0.1%. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It just looked like, its just like a, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you know those newspapers
from Harry Potter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where like, everything is just moving. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its just annoying because
every, it seems like, to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as a content creator, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every time YouTube takes one step forward, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they just take two steps back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like what was really sus about
that Twitter post for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was they were just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'guys, we hear you. We
hear the creator feedback. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> We know you asked for this.' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah!] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We are removing the dislike button. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then every creator
comes up and was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Yo. Did you guys ask for this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I didn't ask for this.' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whose feedback is this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because anyone who's making
any content that is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> reasonable, anyone who's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally trying to make good stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> probably isn't afraid
of the dislike button. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because, you know, personally, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, might change by this point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never had a video
that has ever been, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, less than 90%.
Yeah, less than 90% likes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, I feel like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if it is less than 90% likes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You fucked up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, either you fucked up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or it got recommended to
an audience way outside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of your usual audience. Which
is, which is what I noticed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah, I feel like the
dislike button and like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the dislike bar, at least, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think its a really useful resource. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and I saw, 'cause I retweeted it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with the Fallout 'Everyone
disliked this' picture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I was reading through
the replies for that tweet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there were a lot of really, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting points being
made, being like, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One of the biggest points I saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from a lot of big creators was that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'well, if we get rid of the dislike bar, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> then how are people going to judge whether </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the video is like, a scam, or, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something is like, just, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't wanna waste your
time on a 10 minute video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. I think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If it's a scam. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think the first thing
that came to mind was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for me, was tutorial videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was just about to say that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The first thing,
because there are so many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> useless fucking tutorial videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And you know immediately
when you click on something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the dislike bar is, its a 50-50 ratio, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you're just like, all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Immediately close down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Immediately close down
and go to the next one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like back in he day, you know maybe, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, maybe you wanted
a certain, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you wanted some software, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you probably should
have been paying for, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you know. I remember that, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the way that you would judge
if it was a safe way to get it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was like, all right, this
video has lots of comments, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lots of likes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think this is safe.
You click on another video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> its like, 'get this software for free', </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and its like, 80% dislikes, you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'probably not gonna download that.' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Get it from 'this will definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not hack your computer .com!' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For me, its, you know,
sometimes fucking Windows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or some software gets this random error, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're just, you start Googling it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and for some reason,
for me, I've found that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTube tutorial videos has
been more useful than just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Googling it and going into
specific Microsoft forums. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is just, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - From like six years ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you look at it and its like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> posted in 2012, no replies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Its like, cool, thanks! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its no replies, or you get about, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'try these ten million fixes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and one of these will possibly work! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But then like, I'm
just going on a tangent, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> its fucking bullshit as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because sometimes they'll
have like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you have like, a problem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's like, very minor,
and they'll be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 'try uninstalling your RAM
and GPU, putting it back in.' </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I'm not gonna fucking do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like at that point, I'm giving up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm throwing it in the trash. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like I feel that, the
way YouTube tutorials work, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that, you know, you
search up this error code, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and put it in YouTube, and like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there's gonna be one video
that's got a positive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like to dislike ration, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And 90% of the time, that's
the fix I'm looking for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because every other video
is just like, 50-50%s, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I feel like, to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> legitimately the first
thing that came to mind, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - About removing dislikes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its frustrating as well because I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there have been changes that
YouTube has made that, like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I think whenever
YouTube makes any change, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they get shit, like even
if its a good change? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, of course, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, and I think
they have made some changes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where everyone was shitting
on it when it started, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and literally a week
later, no one gives a fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, people, like, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I understand why they did this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was quite
frustrating to get used to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but when they moved the comments, to like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the comments used to be, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you would be on a YouTube video, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like this one right now,
you could just scroll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the comments would be
right there at the bottom! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Uh, but then they moved it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so that you had to just drop
down at it was right there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which, at first, I absolutely hated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought, why would you do this?' </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then now, I'm like,
this makes way more sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mmm. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now that I've gotten used to it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> its streamlined everything.
If I wanna read the comments, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll open it, if I wanna just, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna have to scroll through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all these fucking videos, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, if we're going
you know, all the way back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the like, OG times right, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember, there was
a massive uproar when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> YouTube changed, you know,
from the five star rating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was dog shit anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, I mean, I understand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - With Netflix, as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I understand it,
and I prefer this new YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, of course, but like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember back in the
day, people were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'no I'm so used to rating five stars,' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now YouTubers were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'well how am I gonna end off the video? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I used to be able to say rate five stars, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but now I got to like,
ask people to like?' </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Smash the like button? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Eurgh, smash the like button? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (fake vomiting) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do think that when they
do these changes, as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like, they must have
some data on their end. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That says this is a good idea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, yeah. Its not
completely, baseless, I'm sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. Which is why, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I wish that they would be like 'listen,' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Open about it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'This is our idea,
right? We're thinking,' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not be like, 'listen. We hear you.' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fucking hate that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't fucking pretend like
you're doing me a solid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't pretend like you give a shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about the people who use your website. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Thanks, thanks
corporation, my best friend! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You wanna do me a solid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and reply to me when I
have a fucking problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't fucking tell me that
you're removing dislikes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like they give a. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the only reason they're
fucking doing it anyway, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm pretty sure everyone knows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're doing it because
of this is like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> a bunch of really big names
got into controversies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And dislikes play a really pivotal part. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like, 'cause, you
know, I think, in YouTube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we have this way where we have like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of decided, that a
YouTube apology, if you will, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> its success is based on like to dislike. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I think that YouTube
is trying to get rid of that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> where we judge a video's quality on that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I kind of like that
because, I mean obviously, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, I wouldn't be saying this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if I was on the receiving end of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But as someone who's seen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, an apology video or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think its awesome as a viewer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its also cool, as well,
because I, a lot of the times, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> use that as a gauge to figure out, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the general idea of what the community </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thinks about this particular field. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because sometimes, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> when these apology videos
come out, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'eh, that's a good apology', </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I look at the video and there's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, 20,000 likes
to 100,000 dislikes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, whoa, why's everyone, like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What did I do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Am I missing something here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly, exactly. Like, it kind of re, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess it like, rejustifies like, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do I really, fully understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the whole context of this video? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because, I might think this
is a good apology video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but 100,000 other people disagree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So its kinda like, oh
okay well then, maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I should look into it more, but. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also there's just something cathartic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about having the dislike button there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, it is, it
just doesn't feel right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're just smashing a button, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it just doesn't really mean anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Its like, its like, going onto a video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right? And just seeing
the comments turned off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Nothing makes me more like, angry, than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going on a video, and wanting, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not even wanting to comment on it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just wanting to see what
other people think of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And just being removed
removed that privilege. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I just feel like, as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> this is just gonna lead
to more shitty comments. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because if you take away one avenue, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as, you know, you know, we all saw with, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> what is it? Like, Twitter, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Its just ratio-ing them.
That's like, the new thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did Twitter ever have a dislike button? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think it did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, they never had a dislike button. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, but, they changed, oh they took, oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like ratio-ing is
a recent thing, though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, ratio-ing is a
recent thing, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why did ratio-ing start happening? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think its because, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do we wanna explain what ratio-ing is? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I've talked to several people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they've not known what ratio is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, ratio-ing, oh, I
mean do you wanna explain? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - On Twitter? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah its basically like,
where, if a tweet is so bad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right? You'll know its an awful tweet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when there'll be like,
more replies than likes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's called ratio-ing because like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the ratio is so much higher
to comments than likes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or if the reply to the original tweet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> has more likes than the original tweet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its like both, either ways, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I feel like, you know,
if there's likes on the video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> people are just gonna start
ratio-ing in the comments. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally they're just gonna
like up the one talking shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But on YouTube you can like,
delete the comments as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. It just
seems like a stupid idea, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] But that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Its like, that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think that's why its
such a big problem for people, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I think a lot of
YouTubers realise that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because creators can, and have
the space to delete comments, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if they want to, and delete like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hateful, hurtful, negative comments. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which you should be able to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which you should be able
to, don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But, you know, you can't
get rid of a dislike. Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And for a lot of people, if
they go onto a YouTube video, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and they realise 'oh, this
person who uploaded this video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is getting rid of negative comments'. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well then, the only other way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can express how I feel about this video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is to hit the dislike button. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. And another thing is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the way they framed it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like they were doing a
solid for the creator, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> where the creator, they literally said </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the creator can still see how
many dislikes this video has. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, it doesn't help the creator at all, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because they're the only
ones who can still see it! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I felt the exact same way when Instagram </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got rid of publicly showing
how many likes a post has, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and yet the creator </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can still see how many likes the post has. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, what's the difference? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> At that point. Like, you're still putting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this like, pressure on the
person putting it up, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - With Instagram, I'd actually argue </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it was a good thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it was a good thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You think so? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think so. Because I
think Instagram was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> highly competitively toxic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> With likes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess maybe I didn't think that way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm not part of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not into that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not a like, if you
follow me on Instagram, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sorry, that there is just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> zero content and zero updates at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Its a dead account. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really says a lot when
out of the three of us, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm the most active on Instagram. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yet, I post like, once a month. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just like, don't like
the platform that much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I think it used be like,
the likes was definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a thing that I didn't really like at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because to me, that was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it really felt like
people were just like-farming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And just like, fucking,
it really bred this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> toxic kind of environment
where people were, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was literally like, a
clout-chasing kind of platform. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, then, question,
then. Would you guys, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> if Twitter, for example, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> implemented the same things Instagram do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> would you be okay with it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would, actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, I dunno. I feel
like Twitter's different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wouldn't want it on Twitter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Wait. Before we get into that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have this like, I
don't know this is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a tin foil hat, a part of me just thinks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is YouTube just trying
to shift all the drama </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> onto like, Twitter? You can't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because you now right, let's
say you, you know, you can't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't dislike something publicly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's say the comments are filtered. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I wonder if YouTube is just being like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 'go to Twitter, go and argue
on Twitter. Don't fuck around,' </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't think about that, but that's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, with the dislikes gone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what is there to do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Other than comment, and you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of the time, with these videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people are just gonna
turn off comments, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking great, just even more toxicity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> heading towards twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do wonder that, because you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if you're a YouTube creative, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if all the shit's going down on Twitter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wonder if YouTube can be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean like, I feel like
that's not going to happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because there's been
such an increase on like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> commentary and drama channels now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that the conversation is still
going to stay on YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> its just a lot of people, maybe, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can only publicly comment
about it on Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah also, also if anything,
it does really seem like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at first glance, it does seem like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone who is following
something on YouTube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also uses Twitter. But that
is really not the case. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I very quickly found out that yes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though I might have a
massive following on Twitter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> compared to, like, the
people who use YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> its really not a lot. Its not
even the majority of people? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, I remember like,
there was this one time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where like, I posted
something on my Twitter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I talked about it on my YouTube, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I got a lot of people being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'well, I don't use Twitter.' </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But in the back of my head I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, yeah! There are some
people who don't use Twitter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No I mean, I think its
gotten to the point now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I've kind of had
this realisation where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> every platform is kind
of like, in its own, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> its, most of the time,
its in its own bubble. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can be really
popular on one platform, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and then open an account
on another platform, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just have like, zero followers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, there's so many like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, YouTubers who
have a million plus subs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on their YouTube, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then when you go onto their Twitter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have, you know, less
than 50,000 followers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its the content right,
like, that's kind of how it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like, also like, I can't imagine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> how many fucking TikTokers
I just don't know about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just because I'm not on the platform. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And the thing is, like, they
can open a Twitter account, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because to me, like, the
way I see Twitter now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just like, fucking influencer Facebook. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It literally is, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's basically what
its like for me now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like, sometimes I hear
about a TikToker who has like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking millions and millions
of followers on TikTok, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> opens a Twitter, and its like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, less followers than us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even though they have like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> more followers on their own platform. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - In YouTube terms, if they
had that many subscribers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> on like, YouTube, then they
would be massive creators. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not all followers, slash
subscribers are created equal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> though, right? So. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah that's, that's true.
Like, it also really depends on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how much you focus and
post on that platform. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And how much you're
known by your audience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to use that platform. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Man. I wondered,
because I'm thinking like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, as content creators, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, if you're somebody who, say, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> does not give a fuck about
anything and you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'I don't care about what
people say about me,' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like the only,
really, tool that like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> an audience or a platform has to kind of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what's the word? Police
you, or give feedback, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is like, public shaming, almost. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like getting rid of
the dislike is a part of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, taking away from that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I feel like, as content creations, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> content creations,
creators, sorry, oh my gosh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, the only real
tool other than like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> YouTube deleting your channel is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, I know it sounds bad, because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it sounds really fucking
terrifying, this public shaming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But that's like, the only real tool, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that is there to like, stop
you from doing shitty stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Most of the time. For a lot of people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Who are, questionable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think, removing
the dislike button </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is not gonna get rid of toxicity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its not. Like, its just
gonna get other people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to figure out other creative ways </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to produce that toxicity, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly, right? All
that's gonna happen is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna shift into another form, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I feel like, to me,
removing the dislike button is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just so weird, to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its just censorship. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think its censorship. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like its a form of it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because again, like, you
know, if there's, again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, a video where its an
apology video or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> controversial, and you
turn off the comments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the dislikes aren't showing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then how else are you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> supposed to say anything? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like the term censorship </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gets thrown around a lot nowadays, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like this is pushing the definition </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of what censorship is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well what it is, is
that its removing a way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for us to express ourselves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wonder if its a similar case to when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, when the whole
'Kids on YouTube' thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where they were all doing,
like gymnastics or something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> people were commenting gross things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then YouTube's response was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> we'll just turn off all the
comments for kids' videos.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then YouTube's like, well
there's no more paedophiles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on YouTube now. They're all gone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. If you can't see paedophiles, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then they're not there, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'What do you mean, where are they? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's no realization on
YouTube, there's no dislikes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> what do you mean?' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It almost feels like
that. That YouTube's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you just remove the option
to show it publicly to anyone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It doesn't exist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its just the whole like, see
no evil, hear no evil, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. There's fucking tons
of videos of kids doing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> probably inappropriate
things on YouTube still, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and that fucking creeps are
still watching them, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But now its harder to
fucking find these videos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and report them! Because, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> how the fuck are you
supposed to when you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's not like, a bunch of
creepy dudes in the comments. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Unless you like, actively go out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and search for those videos, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but who the fuck is wasting
their time doing that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pedophiles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean like, normal people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> who are trying to get rid of those, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, there's so many circles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so many like, rabbit holes that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure people can fall down in YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we are just not aware of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, because that just
shows how big YouTube is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as a platform how like, I feel for YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because when you have a platform this big, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no matter what you do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's going to be something
wrong with your platform. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. 100%. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I feel like, what they're doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with the dislike button is its
going in the wrong direction. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just because, just
because a problem exists, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, removing your ability to express it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> or removing your ability
to see that problem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't get rid of the problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It just shifts it to somewhere else. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And, yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I really don't know
what they were thinking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like its not even about like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shifting it, as well.
Its not only shifting it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I feel, more times than not, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it also propels it? Into something like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot more toxic and a lot
more just, out of control. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it, I think it
would breed more toxicity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that just means people
have to find another way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It just means that,
like, the people who are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> shouting the toxicity now just
have to shout it even louder. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - For them to be like, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I need people to see what
I have a problem with. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Because if, like,
part of the catharsism, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if that's a
word, of seeing a shitty video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is just knowing that you're
not the only one who agrees </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that this is a shitty video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, right. Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right? And there's,
you know, it is good, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you see this bad
video or this bad apology, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you know, you can see that one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the first thing that you
see is the dislike button, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and the dislike bar. Like, my god. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was great seeing like, YouTube Rewinds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just seeing that
everyone collectively agreed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it was just, a train wreck, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Sorry YouTube, but it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love how a lot of the
comments, as well, were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ah man, YouTube was just
salty that they got ratio'd. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think that was
the reason, on record, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was a good meme, it was a good meme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think that was
the reason, on record. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like this is the official
reason you're salty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Corporates at YouTube are like, fuck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't believe people hate
our products like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Susan's just like, 'I'm
never gonna forgive them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I cannot believe it'. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'After all these years,' </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> she's just been planning this for years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> waiting for like, the right
person to be cancelled </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like, okay, now's the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now we have an excuse! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now we have an excuse to implement this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wonder if they were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was this YouTube meeting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and they were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'guys, everyone's hating on
cancel culture right now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's be the ones to end cancel culture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's remove the dislike
button.' And they're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'oh my god you're a genius! They're gonna, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> oh YouTube is gonna love this!' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who would have thought it was that easy? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They can't be cancelled
anymore, there's no dislikes! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why is everyone hating
this?! What is happening? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, I thought we were doing a good thing! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought you guys hated cancel culture! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're removing negativity! What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what it feels like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it really is, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just 'cause like, before
this, I would say that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually, I think YouTube was
in a pretty healthy stage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Twitter was fucked,
but YouTube was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, YouTube was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Twitter was like, toxic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and obviously felt a bit vile sometimes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but YouTube just felt like,
just a dislike and that was it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was just, it was a nice balance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - A nice little finger, like fuck you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or like, fuck you, okay,
I'll get on with my day now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like, I think they have done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of positive changes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I do like the changes they
did to the copyright system. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Its not perfect, but its
better than it was before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like the fact that you have to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> specifically put a timestamp </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of what part of your
video's been copyrighted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And as a creator, you can
still remove that, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> part that's been copyright striked, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and have no effect on your
channel. I think that's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the best balance that
we could have hoped for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And when you appeal
for it, it like, goes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the money you make from that video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> now goes into this limbo state where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't go to the creator, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it doesn't go to the
supposed copyright holder. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that was a good change! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which was fucking fanta, its like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've been wanting that for years now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and YouTube was like,
we've heard your feedback. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - To be fair, that probably
should have happened </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in the beginning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It should have, like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean it should have
happened in the beginning, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but what I'm saying is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They eventually did it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they eventually did it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it felt like this change, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the changes they're making
now, is just unnecessary, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because nobody asked for
this, and I think, right now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before this, as a content
creator, I was pretty happy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with YouTube as a platform, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You knew what, you knew
what you could get away with, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you knew what you couldn't get away with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, if, I feel like
right now, if a video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if one of your videos gets
demonetised, aside from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Trash Taste videos, because, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I don't know why
half of the videos that got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> demonetised got demonetised, because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. Well like, most of the time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if I upload something and
its a 10 to 15 minute, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I know which videos are more
high-risk to get demonetised. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I know, most of the
time, its kind of on me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for making that video subject. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then, you have Trash
Taste, where, for some reason, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of our podcast episodes
just get demonetised, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and we hit, and its just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we hit the appeal button, and
I guarantee, the person who's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, reviewing the content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did not watch the entire 2 hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're like 'ah fuck, its 2 hours long, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Jim, you gonna watch the whole thing? No? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck it, we'll just
leave you yellow then.' </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's weird about the Trash
Taste episodes is that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think, on record, we have about like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> five or six of the episodes
now that are still demonetised, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but its five or six of the episodes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that shouldn't have been demonetised. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We look at it, we look
back at them and we're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what part of
this video flagged what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but, we have like, a bunch
of other videos and episodes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where its like, these are the ones, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if anything, that should
have been demonetised. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah, true yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But they're not for some reason? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like the convenience
episode, that got demonetised, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, the combini
episode got demonetised, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and yet the hentai episode
is still monetised. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hey, dude, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt shushing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't tell them that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ah sorry, the fancy font episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> One is still monetised, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Greek, the Greek letter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all fake laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anyway, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all sighing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, the one time, like, one day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I think to myself 'okay, I've figured out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what exactly YouTube does not like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about whatever video it is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> flags the demonetisation
system,' and then the next day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, 'nevermind, I
don't know what you want.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because another thing I've
noticed about YouTube recently, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is, in a positive light, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when did YouTube comments get really good? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that just me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you mean, good? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The comments sections right now, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you click on a random meme video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the comments are always golden, and, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it didn't used to be that way because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it used to be this one overused joke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in every comment section, but, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'No one, comma.' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like the no one joke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're all fucking copypastas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. But nah, but nah,
I don't know if its just me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but I think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah they're pretty funny now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like half my enjoyment when
clicking on a random video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just going to the comment section. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its weird because I
feel like the whole like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, commenting in a
meme format, in a meme video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Its just like, I don't
know, people are just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thinking to themselves, okay,
in order for me to stand out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in this absolute cesspool of
comments on this one video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I actually need to be,
surprise, creative about it! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Otherwise I'm just gonna get
swept in with all these other, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, meh comments, so now people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> now there's like this
weird pressure to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'if I'm gonna comment on this meme video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I gotta make it a fucking banger joke, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> otherwise, no one's gonna like it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and its just gonna get buried.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then you haven't
commented in the first hour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you're not gonna be in
the top comments, anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (screen warping) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - This episode is sponsored by ExpressVPN. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know that none of
you watch porn, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, of course not. Ew! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But just in case, you
have any friends that do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll want to pay attention to this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> With everything going on in the world, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> governments have increased
their surveillance, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they're using your device
to track your location, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> movement and in many countries, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your internet activity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't want to be literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> caught with your pants down, do you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and one of the best ways to
keep your online browsing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you do private,
is by using ExpressVPN! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - When you use ExpressVPN
your internet connection </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is rerouted through a
secure, encrypted server </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so you can surf the web anonymously, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> without anyone looking over your shoulder. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know you're probably thinking that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all you have to do is use incognito mode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and no one can see that you've watched </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every last hentai video on PornHub. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, that's, that's not how it works? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're wrong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey gasps) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Again, Joey, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even when you're using incognito mode, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your internet provider
like Comcast or AT&T </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can see every single website you visit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And if you live on
campus, or you share WiFi, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your network admin can, too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Its kinda scary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why I use ExpressVPN
whenever I go online, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I recommend all of you do the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Without ExpressVPN, you're
giving people a free license </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to peek over your shoulder and frankly, </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I'm curious. As content
creators and YouTubers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who have not given their feedback, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - As influencers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor scoffing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - As influencers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - God, I hate that word. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who have not actually given
their feedback to YouTube, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Uh-huh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is there anything you
would like to say to YouTube </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to improve the platform? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Is there any actual feedback </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you would like to give to YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Uhhhhhhhh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Apart from, and hopefully,
they'll actually hear us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Uhhhhhhhh. That's a good question. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because like, for
me, like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> there's another system that's
just been recently implemented </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and its the checking system. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, I uploaded a
video recently and, so, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so, for those of you who don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you upload a video,
YouTube used to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> some pre checks to make sure it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> content friendly, and content monetisable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now, those checks for
absolutely no reason, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just take, an hour plus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] That's quite a while. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if its because its like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this new system is in
beta, or whatever, but, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I heard nothing about this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they weren't transparent
about that at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the first time it happened on
one of my videos I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> oh no, am I in trouble? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's going on? Why, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, diagnosing you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why are there like,
fucking, enhance, enhance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this video to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'we gotta find at least one frame </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where we can fucking sic this guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. I don't know who the fuck </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is in charge of PR, but
why does it always feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that when they like, tell us something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> finally, they tell us
something, and its like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the dumbest shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, we didn't need to know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that dislikes are being removed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey And Grant] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I, how about you just reply
to my emails when I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> having a problem, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's the one thing
is consistently been an issue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think everyone talks
about, which is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> communication and the fact
that when you have an issue, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that could be very simple,
becomes ten times more difficult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because YouTube's just like fuck you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not gonna talk to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And its like, well, you
know, and its not like you're, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> not making decent money
for YouTube, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even if its your living, it
feels like, well, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well that's the thing, right?
Like, and that's the part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I can't exactly
be like, wow YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't believe you ignore
us like that because I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fuck, like, how many
channels are there now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that have over a million subs?
Like already that's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thousands and thousands and there is just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably all of those YouTubers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> probably have at least
one period in their life, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I need you to reply to
me, so its like, I feel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - How often do you need
to email YouTube for help? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, once a year at most. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, maybe like, once or twice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So then like, at that level, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's say if there is like
some kind of mythical barrier, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> its like, a million subs,
you get to have someone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That doesn't seem too unreasonable to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But also I feel like, its
something that YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just doesn't wanna do either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, they don't wanna fuck with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And again like, you
know, that would be fine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> if it was only those million plus subs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who even have access to
the YouTube email, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, you could have a channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with fucking 10 subs be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'umm, YouTube why did you
delete my video, please help.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So its like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah because most, you know,
if you are a YouTuber, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> You're probably following an
account called Team YouTube </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on Twitter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is like, YouTube customer support, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but not on their own fucking platform. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But its a bot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know, you might tweet
them something that gets like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> tons of attention, tons
of stuff, and then, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they won't reply to it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they'll be replying
to someone who's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, a bunch of other people who are like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'hey I got locked out of my account,' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're like, 'oh well,
here's how you can do it!' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its a bit fucked that
in order to get YouTube's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> attention, you literally
have to ratio them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah you do, I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to spam them, its unfortunate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you do, its like,
you just got ratio'd! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTube's like fuck, you got me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All right, we'll help you out, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its like, how well can you ratio? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's how quickly we'll
reply to your email. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But also you know, you know, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've heard people who've
got immense amount of help </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because they, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> went to like, one YouTube event, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> met a YouTube employee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then they'll pull strings for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that feels like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> its like, being in like, fucking prison, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> its like, well your mate
knows the prison guard, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so you're not gonna get shanked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Its like, what, how is that fair? Like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm stuck in this system
and I have to work with you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I can't fucking do anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Its like, maybe I don't wanna
go to your fucking workshop, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube? Have you thought about that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe I just want some help,
because my video got wronged. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because the only time I
ever got help from YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was because I got very lucky </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I had a really good partner manager, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who's super super like, I think, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think at the time
they were new to YouTube </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were super down and like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really be in depth and
talk with me and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'hey, what do you need,
what do you need help with,' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were very nice and
helped me out a lot, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just sitting
there the whole time while </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was getting all this help,
I was like oh my god, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I sent how many fucking emails,
did so many other things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We sent to so many people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all it took was just one YouTube employee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> who was nice to me, who
recommended me to like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the engineering team or whatever, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And all my problems
got fixed, and its like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> this is so dumb that
this is what it takes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To be like, I have to
have a man on the inside. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to help me out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You need a double agent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like, its like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they don't work there anymore, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I don't even have the helping one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so now I'm fucked with my issues. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now you're back to square one, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've just gotta like, cry on Twitter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I hate doing that. I
don't wanna be a child. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you know one feature on YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that I do genuinely want removed? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I dunno if I would
be the only one here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the 'your video is this ranked out of ten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of your previous ten videos.' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Ahh. Nah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, I understand it does serve a use, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but I don't, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, indifferent
to it, because its like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it depends on how well
the video did really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where its like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the point! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, where its like, where its like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if I see a video and then its like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'your video got less views
from your frequent viewers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nine out of ten.' When its just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fuck the system. But then when its like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'one out of ten,' then
you see those fireworks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like, 'damn, I'm good!' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think we explain the
system about performance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to recap real quickly,
YouTube ranks your videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and how they're doing
against your other videos, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the past ten videos, it
ranks them one out of ten. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> One being the best, ten being the worst. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I actually quite like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You like it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - As much as I hate it, I like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think its good, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I, before, I remember,
did you used to have like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> an estimate in your head
of what was good views? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. For me, it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if I get so-and-so views
in the first 24 hours, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good view. If its over that, great video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Below that? Bad video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - The problem with that is that, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> your average of what I
expect a video to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is never static, and that
number is always changing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think its good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I don't know what
I should be aiming for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And at least this has
kind of helped me like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> set expectations and
figure out, okay, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Its been a really good way
of figuring out personally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right, if something's number ten, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right, let me go and reevaluate that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah it fucking sucks,
I'm not happy about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And sometimes I genuinely do think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was that a really fucking good video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that got fucked by one reason or another. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But most of the time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I do feel like its been really helpful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> As much as it makes me wanna just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> quite YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel though, like, its
kind of a double-edged sword </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in that case, though, because, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember where you know,
when you have like, say, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a really fucking good streak, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Of like, one to two months worth of videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that are just banger
after banger after banger, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> its like, all over performing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its like the stock market, your bubble. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Your bubble's gonna pop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, you know the fall's coming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and then you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm expecting the fall, where's the fall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and then, you wake up the next morning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and your video's like nine out of ten, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or even like, a ten out of ten, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And you're like, well shit.
This is the end of my career. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] So this is what you do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then, when you
look at that video, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in retrospect, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you just say screw it
to the other nine videos, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> let me just look at this video on its own. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And its actually doing okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just feels like the video is doing crap </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because your other nine videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were just over performing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You wanna hear a big brain strap? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Just make a shit video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Just make a shit video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You gotta, you purposely
make a ten out of ten? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Here's what I do,
right? Every now and then, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, as much as I
think all my ideas are, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, mostly good, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes I'll make a video,
and it comes out shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I'm like, you know what? Fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Have a ten out of ten. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Put my expectations down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Reset the expectations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, yeah, let's just fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's humble myself for a moment here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's just upload a shit video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I upload videos where I thought like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my god, what am I doing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then like, I've also
had the opposite happen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm like, this is
a ten out of ten video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, this is garbage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is unwatchable, and it
literally got one out of ten, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, I fucking hate
it here. This video sucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've had that before, as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The worst ones are like, damn, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is gonna be a banger video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Nine out of ten. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ah, nothing feels worse than that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nothing feels worse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nothing feels worse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like my entire like, I
check that in the morning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> once a video goes up, I see
that, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> entire day ruined. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess one other
thing is that maybe like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I do see the usefulness in it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I don't think it should be removed, but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it should be harder to find, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because its like, front and center. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is literally the first thing you see. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally the first thing
you see when you log in, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> To your account. And YouTube's
either giving you a clap, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt clapping) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or being like, son, I
expected better from you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck is wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Man, I don't know, I
think it's all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think where it is is fine, honestly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think its just how you like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> personally perceive it, all right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor sighing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it very much takes a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to kind of take
your emotions out of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a little bit to really appreciate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which sounds so robotic, if you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think you just have to
appreciate the data for what it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All it is, is neatly packaging </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the truth you're hiding from yourself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a way that is digestible
within 10 seconds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well no, I think you know, that's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> healthy advice to be like, 'yo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You should just get over it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You should just not be sad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Stop being sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just don't be emotional,
just why you feeling emotions, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, its just your
livelihood. Fuck off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean we've talked about
it before, like, how you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of YouTubers before said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't care about
the views. But you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you do have, like, as
much as you want to think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you're not emotionally
attached to your content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the numbers around
your content, you do care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Its your job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - At some level. You do care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And its not like, I think you just have, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you would have to be a heartless robot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to make something you're proud of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and not care about how
many people view it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The way I see it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> its that I don't care if I spill my drink, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I do care if I spill my drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it wrecks my PC and
fucks everything up, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I feel there's an
acceptable amount of fucking up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm like, 'ah, I'll
deal with that.' Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> If I get one ten out of
ten, ah, well, all right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, it happens. Something's
gotta be ten out of ten. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Two ten out of tens in a
row, I'm like, all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, it happens sometimes, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Three ten out of tens, I
will care, what is going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's when I start, that's
when it starts to affect me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But the first one, I don't
really let it affect me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, you know what, just
statistics are just saying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that this is gonna
happen eventually, like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, no, I completely
get that, right, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of course, eventually
you're gonna have to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a ten out of ten. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love math, and you
know, I appreciate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. No I do too, don't get me wrong! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I know, I know that
eventually this streak, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever it is I'm on, is gonna
eventually run out, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and you know, even
then, if you think about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right, the more you're
getting five out of tens, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> six out of tens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All you're doing is making
it closer and closer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right. Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So if you're getting one out of tens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or tens out of tens every time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're making a like,
famine or feast situation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Which is fine, but, what I'm at right now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at least with my past few videos, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all been around like, give or take, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> minimal percentage away from each other. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like the difference between
third and eighth for me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is nothing. So like at
that point I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even feel bad about any of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I'm like, ninth or third, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> its barely any difference to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So why is YouTube trying to make me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking feel bad about
it. Stop that YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No but, because there's another factor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I feel like, this doesn't take like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> account for, and that's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a long term performance of a video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because like, some of my
videos, some of my videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that have been a nine, ten out of ten, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have gone on to grow into be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some of my most popular videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I feel like it,
what this system like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really emphasizes, is how
well a video does short term. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas YouTube, as
like, a content creator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that has been on the platform
for a very long time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I know that short term
performance doesn't mean a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like, no matter what,
no matter if I make a video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm proud of and I
think is gonna perform well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> long term, I still feel shit about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if it just is that nine or ten out of ten. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No need, you need one out
of your whole channel uploads. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like one out of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one thousand or however
many uploads you have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I think that's
just going onto videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and looking up most popular. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah but then you'll always feel good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because you'll never have,
like, a lowest one ever again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you'll never have less
views. You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like, YouTube come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its like, whenever you're
feeling bad, just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> lemme just go check out my
most viewed videos of all time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what? I still got it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its like, okay, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if us talking about this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how the viewers
feel about this being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wow this is such a first
world problems nowadays, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Jesus Christ, they're
complaining about this, but, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the reason like, I think
about it a lot is because. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Before this, I really did
not give a shit about, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't, not that I didn't give a shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't really put as much
focus on my mental health </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until I started working
in a creative industry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I realised, oh
shit my mental health </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually matters when it comes to my work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where before I would just
like, grind out my job, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like shit, but it
would be easy, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then drink the sadness
away at home, am I right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then drink the
sadness away, or just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking wait for the weekend,
you live for the weekend, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you reset. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But now, its like a constant, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually have to care about this thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> otherwise it will literally affect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how well I'm performing at my job. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have no more weekends
and I'm constantly home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like, not saying if
you have bad mental health </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you'll have an easy
time doing a job, but. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like, in a creative job, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you really see the effects
of having bad mental health. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is why to me, like,
this, a system like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to me, is like, you get more
Ls than Ws in my opinion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, of course, absolutely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And its, its a system where
its like, you get that one W, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> three times out of ten. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, its also because you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're fighting in a system </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that you have absolutely
no control over, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Its like, you can't
control whether a video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gets a ten or a one, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its just, how it is, so
when you do get that one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or you do get that dub, its
like, fucking three hundred </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> winning against the Persian Empire right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> its like, oh shit, I mean
I wasn't expecting it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but fuck me I'll take it. You know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Little man's pulling through. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, literally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know what? There is
another feature on the whole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rating your videos and
how they perform thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I don't actually quite like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I think its just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the language they use
is just like, fuck off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Its where its like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this video is performing worse than usual. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hate that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Its like my mum talking to me, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wish I could just put it
in like, another language, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like fuck off, I don't
wanna read this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Its like that
passive aggressive note </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's left on the fridge when
you're living in university. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, its like, motherfucker,
I know how to read a graph. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't need you to tell me. Its like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the like, there is one curve
that is lower than the other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This curve is lower than the other, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that means its doing worse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, no shit its doing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's typically how graphs work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It tells you information. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - What I hate is that it starts
off with the layman's terms </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like, this is performing
worse than usual. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it goes on to be like,
its performing 40%, 7% less. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You didn't, you could have just
got rid of that first part, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you coulda just said
its performing 47% less. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I would've. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its the pandering language that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube tries to use of like,
'yeah, we care about you,' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'We hear you.' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'We hear you.' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'We hear you.' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Its like, this isn't an
intervention, but it could be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So sort your shit out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Its frustrating. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do you guys feel
about the algorithm itself? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't give a fuck anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't even know what
it is at this point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you know, again, its like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, when you grow,
right, you give a fuck, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like, write that down, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, any time MatPat would say anything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like, fuck, write that down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Whenever you're
growing you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well shit, I need to be listening to this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Other wise I'm gonna be stuck
in my sub count forever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But when you get to a
certain point and you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just kinda make whatever
the hell you want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its just like, I feel
like I've figured it out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then some days its just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'nope that's not how that works.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean I feel like every creator, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at least that's been around for a while. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like this is probably like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> a reason you do stay around a while, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that you just stop valuing
getting crazy sub growth. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And just being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just wanna make good shit
that just maintains what I have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, I don't think
that you need to keep growing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we will keep growing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but its not something I really care about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well that's my mentality of its like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at the end of the day, if I see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that I have more subs
at the end of the day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than I did at the beginning of the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whether that's one sub
or ten thousand subs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> its like well, I'm still here, I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like, I feel like, as a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the hard part is getting to around like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 100k to 500k subscribers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I feel like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because luck plays such a big part. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In that, and getting your
videos on the algorithm itself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I feel like, once you
get to around that size, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it like, becomes more predictable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than people give it credit for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, because at that point, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it becomes more like a game, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where you know what's gonna perform well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you kinda know what's gonna perform well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And sometimes you get this
lucky hit where you just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, I don't know why
this video's doing so well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but most of the time, if
you get to a past 100k, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can kind of predict how,
what you need to do to grow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you understand what
the system, at least. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you understand the platform. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like its always about, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to get to the million, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to go through the proving ground </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, to get to that size </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to consistently </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> prove to YouTube that you can make content </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that is engaging to people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Then I feel like you
can just kinda be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all right, well, you know, I feel like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it feels like less effort
'cause you just know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what you're doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You feel like, I put
less thought into things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, oh, you know,
I know that won't work, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> inherently like, just by looking at stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, that's a bad thumbnail, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a bad title, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then you can just kind of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not take it easy, but you
can focus more on just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> having a healthy work schedule, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, we've said this
before a hundred times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm sure everyone can
figure it out, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you first start out its
brutal, the hours you put in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For nothing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I also like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - For like $2 ff you're lucky. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I also like, I remember, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back in the day when I was still growing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I never once thought to
myself, 'that's a good title', </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or 'that's a bad title', 'that's a good', </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'that's a bad thumbnail', right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just tried to explain the video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I was like, wait,
that's not how it works. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> here is an image of game
with number in the corner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Episode 7. Done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'The Sebastian Call Where
the Girl Gets Excited' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was like, well that's
not. That's not a good title. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I started changing it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but past you was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'I mean, now people know
what this video is,' right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like the
platform has changed a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> since we started growing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You could get away with
doing the parts before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't do parts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. Not anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't do video parts now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Unless you have, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a massive series that people
are really waiting for. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, we say parts, but
fucking Trash Taste is parts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> we've literally put
numbers on each of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean that's just for ease, isn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> To keep track of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean its kinda like, I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> its parts but you can enjoy each part. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I don't even call it a part. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Its an episode number, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you can enjoy
each episode, by itself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there are also
people who are just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are like, totally ingrained in like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the Trash Taste lore,
whatever the fuck that is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I go onto our subreddit
sometimes and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man, the amount of layers that new like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> viewers would have to understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just to get this one meme
is fucking ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We literally have a chronological order, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and a fucking, like, a lore order. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Where its like, no its watching order </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and chronological order. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because like, the
Trash Taste lore, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> watching our subreddit goes
beyond just our channel now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It just like, everyone
we've ever interacted with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is now part of the Trash Taste lore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - True. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Its hilarious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I find it like, I find it impressive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how people have just like,
been able to create this like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> because its not even like, its
not even logically laid out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> People just have this
unwritten understanding that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Okay, yeah, this is part
the Trash Taste lore, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and part of the Trash Taste group.' </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, the only other like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> group I've seen this dedicated is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> people who are into the
Nasuverse, where its like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Its just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow. Call just me out, Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's the Nasuverse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its a fake lore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its the fake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its like, they're fucking
pulling it from like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally nowhere that has
anything to do with anything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> being like, 'well, I mean
Garnt did say this thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on this like, tiny like,
YouTuber's podcast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, six years ago, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm pretty sure this has
a connection somewhere </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to one of these episodes.' Where its like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its weird man, it
feels like the first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> on YouTube where people actively
care about what I'm doing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, doesn't that sound strange? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, before I just felt
like no one gave a shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what I was up to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Just do my own thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Now I feel like, people actually like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> watch when I do something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like, whoa, this is weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well that's the thing, its like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've noticed that whenever I
go onto the subreddits like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> half of these posts
have nothing to do with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the actual Trash Taste episodes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Its like, its either drawn
from like, someone's Twitter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or someone's Twitch, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> or a guest's Twitter or a guest's Twitch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Its like, or like, a friend
of one of the host's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its kind of cool, though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I'm not saying
this is a bad thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, its dope as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just, like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just find it really interesting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that it became like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, what I find really interesting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that people are able to
follow along, with this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though there's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's no fucking coherent watch order? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now we've gone to the point
you can watch every episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of Trash Taste and still
not understand everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going on in the subreddit, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] No, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because then you have
to follow our content, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to follow other people's content, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other people's Twitter, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> god fucking damn, man, respect to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Honestly. Its cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just so confused. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm on this podcast and
I don't know the lore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't keep up with the
shit that's been going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know what's canon
and what's not canon anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like what is canon, what is not canon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Its just, I just view it as
one of the people in like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the fucking lore, and
I'm just like, damn man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What is going on right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess I did say or
do that, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everyone's just calling
me a VTuber simp now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's all they call me now.
That's what they're saying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah that's been the hot meme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, we just did this episode again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> by just saying that right
now, the big hot meme </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the Trash Taste subreddit
is Connor making every VTuber </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he interacts with into a Connor simp. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Essentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is hilarious, because you were the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen this fucking
screenshot everywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whenever someone mentions that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you're the Vtuber simp, now, being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this one screenshot that just says </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'I don't understand VTubers.' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I still kinda don't, like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meanwhile every VTuber's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well, I understand you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really enjoy collaborating with VTubers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and talking to them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think, mainly from the aspect of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, I don't particularly care about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the character themselves,
or who they're playing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think just as a content creator myself, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I find it really interesting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what it takes to play a
character like that permanently. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And its normally, you know,
when you talk to the VTubers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if I talk to them offline, where you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you normally get some really
interesting bits of information </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just about how, you
know, they like, prepare, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or how they think about it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and I just find that really fascinating. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're collaborating with
a VTuber, I don't know why, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think there's a really
interesting dynamic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can work off really well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if its one Vtuber and
one like, IRL person. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where, although I think a lot of, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe diehard VTuber fans
will think 'no! Never!' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 3D and 2D do not mix. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think there is some really
interesting room for like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> really fun and interesting collaborations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that come across because of the 2D-3D mix. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Well, I mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I completely agree, because, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I kind of remember when
Ladybeard was on like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now a few weeks ago I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I remember like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hearing his story and
hearing how he goes about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, his character
and his stage presence, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything like that. I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I kinda think VTubers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I said VTubers were wrestling with waifus, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and after talking to
Ladybeard I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I kinda, I kind of
agree with myself more now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - God. Cognitive dissonance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I found something that proves my point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Thus, it is correct. No,
I do agree, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I spoke to some of your
VTubers, and, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you hear so many different
reasons why they became VTubers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, 'oh, I just wanted easy money', </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or 'oh, I really, really
liked this character', </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> or, I've always, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or 'I can't do anything with
my face, I'm too anxious,' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or, yeah. Everyone has their own reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and its really fucking
cool to hear about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And, get to know the people
behind it, sometimes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel the like, especially
recently, like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe still in Japan, there
might still be a thing of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'oh, you know, 2D and 3D
shouldn't mix,' you know, like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'IRL and VTubers should
never do stuff together </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it breaks the
immersion' blah blah blah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I feel in the West,
especially recently, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel that idea is
slowly starting to fade, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because, especially, you
know, if we're look at like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> VShojo, right. Like, they're
doing a lot more like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> collaboration with IRL streamers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, Nyanners did that whole thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they did a tour of Japan, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that was IRL, and
I think just yesterday, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as of this episode, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Anthony Padilla did like, a
'I spent a day with VTubers.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - They actually had a clip of Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of the Cali episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - On that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Hell yeah. Yeah and I just feel
like, at least in the West, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sure there still might be a
lot of diehard VTuber fans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> who don't want that illusion
to be broken, or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But, I feel the majority
of them are kinda just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'well, I mean, let's not
kid ourselves.' Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, these are also
people, and, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think its cool to see
this, like, really weird, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> two different worlds completely
clashing with one another. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In a really cool way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause like, I will say like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I have been watching less VTubers
as 2021 has rolled around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Part of the reason of that is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime has gotten really,
really good again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I've just had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sorry, I've skipped the waifus, back to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Back to the scripted ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Back to the scripted ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But also its less that
I've just been watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> less VTubers, but I've just
been watching more streamers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in general, now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not even watching streams,
but watching like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the stream highlights
and the stream content </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that has been posted on YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I feel like, there
is a definite difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> between hololive and VShojo,
right? Because I feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> VShojo are VTubers who are streamers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I feel like hololive
is definitely more like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> treated as idols. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And what I found is that I kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more gravitated towards seeing
VTubers as content creators, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, I just respect
them as content creators. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> More than anything, and like, I, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never understood idol anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or like, the idol kind
of industry itself, so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why I've gravitated more
towards VTubers who I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> are just like, beyond anything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are just talented content creators. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And just, doing good content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I think that might be
one of the bigger reasons, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> why nowadays, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm watching a lot of the
streamers from NijiSanji. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because again, like, its not so much, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they kind of treat their
VTubers, again, like streamers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, actual content
creators, because they don't, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're not really seen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure there are people
who view Nijisanji YouTubers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as idols, quote unquote, but. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel, just been in,
like, a lot of live streams </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of all sorts of Nijisanji creators, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there are definitely
a lot more, just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just people, or like,
streamers, or content creators, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who are just here to have, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> shoot the shit and just have a fun time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah, again, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel there's like, a
different of enjoyment to that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> as well as you know, how hololive is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of seen in that sense, and like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not saying one is better
than the other, personally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I just think its a
really interesting dynamic, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because people just think,
'oh if you're a VTuber, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're immediately like, hololive', </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or 'you're immediately like,
VShojo', you're just kind of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thrown into this like, single basket of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'you are this type of content creator </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with this type of fan base.' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When, in reality, its
very very different, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> depending on how, I guess,
you treat your character? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. Its kind of weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even in hololive, even in
the hololive agency itself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are like, a lot
of streamers in hololive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are doing like, very,
very different content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I think the difference
is, now, that, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 2020 was the year of the VTuber. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or hololive's year, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's just like, there'll
be the year of the Zodiac. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The year of the Vtuber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it kind of was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm year of the VTuber. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, 2020 was,
the year of the VTuber. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - The difference between
like, the hype is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean obviously there's,
the viewership's still there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the craze that was there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The growth has like,
slowed out a little bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its definitely gonna be harder, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to grow as a VTuber. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even in an agency like hololive now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because there's so much
competition out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its like the gold rush is already like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah the golden age is
kind of over, right? Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think this year has really, for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> separated like, VTubers, not just VTubers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but streamers who are doing like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> really really interesting
content and just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> interesting ideas vs you
know, a Vtuber who, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't put as much thought
into their content, maybe? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And just, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was trying to find
a nice way to word that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The good ones from the bad
is what you're trying to say? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not the good ones from the bad, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The stronger ones? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The ones who really view this as like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as content, and just like,
as an entertainment platform. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Rather than. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And not just as like, a gimmick, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly.
Because I feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the gimmick part is over
now, the gimmick era is over, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and if you want to grow as a VTuber now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you need to have solid content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. And I think its because, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, the idea of
VTubing as a gimmick now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is just so, just common knowledge, now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that whenever a new VTuber comes out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not as many people are like
'oh my god, did you see this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Its like, a virtual person on
my stream right now,' like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone knows what a VTuber is now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, so curious about
where this is gonna go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, we're in a good spot right now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I feel like, its in like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the middle period, if you will. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, everything's pretty
chill, things all good, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm really interested to see
how the community in general </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> will handle things like, all right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what if a VTuber wants to quit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What if a VTuber wants to show their face, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and just start streaming like that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know. When the stuff,
'cause this hasn't happened yet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, I've clearly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> do you know of any VTubers
who have been like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah fuck VTube, like, big VTubers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they've been like, fuck this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna show my face
and do normal streaming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Probably the one that comes to mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is Kizuna AI. The original one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But that's different,
though, I feel like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, she wasn't
considered like, a streamer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, she wasn't a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You're talking about like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, the VTubers right now. Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean there's been a
lot of Nijisanji VTubers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who have quit, for no reason. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, some, I wonder if
its no reason or you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> NDAs have been signed, you can't say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well no, actually there was
one where she openly was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm quitting just because I've
found something else to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, its nothing like,
I've no bad blood or anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I can say that contractually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I just wanna quit because
I have something new to do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everybody in that fan base
took it really, really well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like, 'well, its
gonna suck that you're gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go, but, at least all your
old content is still here.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right? Like, 'good luck bro' kinda thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well that's good,
yeah, I mean, obviously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at some point I can imagine there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause there's agencies and agencies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> aren't always the best, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, there's probably
gonna be a messy breakup, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> if you will, at some point, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh I mean like, that
has been in the past, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but honestly I don't wanna
get into that shit right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even know about that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't of messy breakups
that have happened, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because of agency stuff,
but, a lot of that is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> its kinda just like, well I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> its an agency we're
dealing with and you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're trying their best to
sweep everything under the rug. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I don't even wanna
deal with that shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to be honest with you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's not dig that stuff up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, let's not dig
that stuff up, right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> its their problem, fuck this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I won't ask. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because like, I'm just
interested to see how the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, how the industry grows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its so new, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it gonna be VTuber
apology videos, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> if so, will there be a deep sigh, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> will they look into the camera? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> These are the things I wanna know. Like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like, re-watching
YouTube evolve but like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> on like, ten times speed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Its like, its so new and
like, nothing's been defined, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the rules aren't set in stone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone's kinda doing their own thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and its kind of Wild West right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And its, I just love watching it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just hearing about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Its so fascinating for
that reason, and you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I said, I don't really watch VTubers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I watch my friends,
because I'm like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gotta, gotta support your friends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, because like, one thing
that I always think about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and one reason why I could like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> never like, be a VTuber
myself is I think about it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and like, part of like, what
I love about being a YouTuber </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and making content where
people know who I am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is being able to meet fans and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being able to meet people at conventions, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just think, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially with conventions and AX stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know, every public
meeting cancelled last year, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and possibly this year as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sad because like,
I don't get to get the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what's the word I'm looking for, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Interaction? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't get to get the interaction. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh I'd never thought about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because at the end of the day, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's, looking at numbers
means nothing to me, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Meeting the people and meeting the fans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of times, it resets, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it reminds me the reason why I do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why I love doing this, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, months of stress
can be wiped out by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one weekend of just, meeting fans, like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause like, I don't know man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> its just, like, its, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its so wholesome. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its like, a rewarding
experience that you'll never, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> its so unique. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It gives you something tangible, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, for all the work that you've done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I just think, man. I
can't imagine being a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a VTuber and just never
being able to meet fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, in person, right? And just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Knowing there's a, so
many people who like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> love you and what you do, and
like, everything about you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you can never say like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is like, weirdly no
better feeling than just, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minding your own business going out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then someone stopping
you on the street being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'I fucking love you.' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because like, because I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that sounds a bit weird out of context. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Its just like, very bizarre. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It sounds weird out of context </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I have had fan
relationships like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like, yeah, but like, as a VTuber, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> no one knows what you look like, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even in some universe
where you could meet fans, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like, they would expect
you to be this character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do they actually like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or do they like this
character they're playing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Or like the character, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its this, its a weird dynamic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that I can't imagine myself having. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well its like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess we appreciate that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I, you know, there's some YouTubers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some VTubers out there that probably like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the last thing they ever
wanna do is meet anyone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. And I feel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which I get, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I feel we can say that you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we might not be able to experience that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and aw its sad that they
can't experience that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because, you know, we've
experienced, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> fans coming up to us and
liking us and praising us, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for who we are, and how
we should ourselves. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But you know, I mean, I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there might be some VTubers out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who have probably never
experienced that, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So they probably don't even know the joy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of that. They just think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well of course the only fan
interactions I'm gonna have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is people who like my character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Um OnlyFans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that's fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fucking ten years old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What are you, twelve? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sorry! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're the most mature one here, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sorry I just completely ruined your. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're the same person who
plays Pokemon and is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'ha ha, they said pee pee.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'PP up.' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'PP up' ah hah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No but like, you know, because I feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if a VTuber went from
traditional YouTubing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where they get that
kind of fan experience, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to then go onto VTubing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and get a completely different
type of fan experience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Then sure, you know,
there might be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'ah fuck, I mean, this
fan interaction is cool, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but its not the same kind of you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gratification I got when it was just me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in front of a camera,' right?' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But to a love of these VTubers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they don't know any better,
so they're probably just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'well, yeah, of course, people
like me for my character,' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they probably don't
give a shit, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for me its, I feel its
the same as you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people going up to voice
actors and actresses, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and being like, 'I love
you because you played </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this character.' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel its the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its like, to them, that's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they're probably expecting that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Its weird because
I obviously look at this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> from a content creator's
perspective, and you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I did ever get the chance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to meet any VTubers I really liked, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would like, 'just wanted to say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> love the fucking content you're doing,' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I also find it really fascinating, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the kind of like, mindset you have to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be this kind of content creator. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because its such a different field </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from what we're doing, and I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> its just really interesting to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is this what it feels like, when like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a parents is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is like, 'I don't get this
whole YouTubing thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it must be very difficult.' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't, I could never
see myself doing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's what I really, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I really respect streamers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they do something
that I find fucking difficult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to do, like, I don't know how. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I'm sure its vice versa
for the streamer, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I don't know how you
go home and stream sometimes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Connor, I'm just like,
I go home, I'm done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I sleep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I don't know how
you go home and sleep, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look at you, you disgust me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, I just
like, I like it. Its fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, I like talking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It seems fun, it seems like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the streaming sphere
right now, it seems like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> its just fun, it just seems like, its. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You get more chance to
just, really collaborate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and make friends as
well, which is one thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm really jealous about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if its because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm paying more attention to
streaming, it just seems like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> its in a really good place right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it is. Its funny
because I think streaming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is in a really good place,
I think Twitch is like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> We've complained about YouTube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, Twitch is terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But my god, Twitch as
a platform, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. Yeah, it is, almost,
just, from how I see it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it seems like, its
almost fucking impossible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to grow on Twitch as like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone who's coming from nothing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, do you guys know why
are all the VTubers on YouTube? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why is most, at least,
at least Japanese ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why are they all on YouTube? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because YouTube, I feel, or
I mean this is just my guess, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but I feel its because YouTube,
to a Japanese audience, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is a lot more well-known than Twitch is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Ah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel Twitch, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> not to say that there aren't
massive Japanese streamers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on Twitch, there are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And some of them pull
insane fucking numbers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I feel its just two
completely different worlds like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't. This is just my guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I feel for a regular Japanese
viewer of content online, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you stick only to one
website, and that's it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whereas like, you know, I feel its like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're a YouTube watcher, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you are exclusively a YouTube watcher. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you're a Twitch watcher,
you're a Twitch watcher. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you're a Niconico watcher,
you're only on Niconico. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas, I feel that same
mentality doesn't work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for a Western viewer, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, A Western viewer will be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'well yeah, I'm gonna watch
some content on YouTube,' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I go where the content is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well yeah, but like, I
can also go onto Twitch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I want to, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I guess so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> = I don't know, maybe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, for me, I
hardly watch any Twitch at all, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> on the Twitch platform, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I think what's becoming
more common now is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Twitch and YouTube are becoming
more and more intertwined, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where like, a lot of, some
of the most popular content, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and some of the most original
content as well, right now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> has been Twitch highlights. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that's why I've grown way more of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an appreciation for Twitch, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I still spend very little
time on the platform, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as a consumer, but, I end up consuming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of Twitch content on YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which is why I think like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of my favourite
content creators right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is probably Ludwig? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where he's just doing like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the subathon that he's
doing right now is insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Definitely over by now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Definitely.
Hopefully is over by now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> My god. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, are you gonna
like, die on camera, like? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is that when the subathon ends? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sleeping on camera is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the most bizarre
things for me to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think about doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you wanna explain
what, who Ludwig is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so Ludwig used to be very big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in the Smash community. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then moved to
streaming and became like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> An instant hit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Streaming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He's very funny, very
naturally charismatic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's just a natural born entertainer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. And he did a
thing where every sub, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it adds 10 seconds I believe? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So every time someone
subscribes to his Twitch channel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 10 seconds gets added,
and it went up to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, 70 hours at one point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. So, the big
difference is that, he made. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Normally in a subathon,
you cap the number of hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can possibly stream for a time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He made the stream stream
uncapped and I think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right now, he's been
streaming for over a week? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Continuously? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ah, its like, two weeks, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was it two weeks? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And he just sleeps on stream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's something to me, that I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> dude, what the fuck, just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like, say things in my sleep. Like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know what you say in your sleep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, listen, listen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't say anything bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But what if its the one day
where I say something bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - One, day where you
have that one nightmare. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does it count if you're
racist in your sleep? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Does that count? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you have that one
racist nightmare, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, what if right,
you're listening to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that, you know, that GTA,
or the modser clip where, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, they say the thing, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What if you go to bed and
then you just say it out loud </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're sleeping. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Can you be cancelled for
being racist in your sleep? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If that actually happened, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would you be cancelled if
someone said, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the thing in their sleep? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Depends if you're a VTuber or not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> VTubers are just like,
that word is just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> free game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every VTuber has that
past for some reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Especially if they're Japanese, but uh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah but what if you're
a white guy, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Ludwig's sleeping and then he sleeps, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> he's talking and then
he says that, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you get cancelled? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - God. There's a part of me that says </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'that's ridiculous, of course not,' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but then another part of me is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'nah, he would definitely get cancelled.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can you be cancelled for your dreams? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like, some George Orwell shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well like, do you have control of your, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what does it say about you if, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Call up the dream police! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you say a racist thing
in your dream are you racist? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm about make a dream TwitLonger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Deadass, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The site for dream police. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait until it happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Its gonna happen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and no one's gonna fucking
know how to deal with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just imagining like,
the plot of Inception, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> instead of like, putting in an idea, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just go in the dream just
to cancel them in the dream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There'll be two camps, there'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the camp that believes
like, you know, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well he just said it in his dream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> There'll be another team like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'I bet he's secretly awake and said it,' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'because he's racist.' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nobody says that in their sleep, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> unless he's awake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because he's awake, and racist! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> This is a really weird tangent,
I just thought, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think its a very valid
thought experiment, though! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its a very valid thought. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I you know, I never do I ever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> ever wanna say bad words like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just wanted to, like, to all respect, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how the fuck was that the
first thing you thought of? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Listen. Because no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - When you saw someone sleeping on stream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - My, what I see when I
see sleeping through stream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> as a content creator, I just think like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything that could go wrong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, what if I shit myself in my sleep? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everything can be taken outta context. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What if I do a rip, an
absolute massive fart. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, the wettest thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just like, any of the stuff that could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> reasonably happen in your
sleep that is totally normal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not being racist in your sleep, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if that's
normal. Probably isn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not that I would know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, and like,
he takes his shirt off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when he was sleeping and you
know, what if you just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you know, sometimes, you
fucking throw the sheets off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're sleeping, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh you sleep naked as well, don't you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well I don't sleep, well, it depends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What if I just pop a
nut on screen, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or if you get, you
know, you're lying down, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you got a morning wood.
Big, big boner, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, right on stream, 4K. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, what, you
get banned for that? Like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just literally thinking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the stuff that you would never ever think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would ever happen normally
when you're sleeping. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But just suddenly become like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is my number one rule
now when I'm sleeping. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No it is valid, it is valid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, there's a lot of
things you don't think about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because you can't control it, you know! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a lot of things,
because with YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we could easily edit stuff
out if we'd said something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just wanna, just wanna
say if I shat myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I would own it by the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - On stream? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would, yeah, I would shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean like, I feel like
the possibly worst thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that could happen on
stream when you're asleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that you just utter
a racist word, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just thinking, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Would you rather utter
a racist word asleep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> or shit yourself? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Id rather shit myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd rather shit myself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? Shit yourself on
stream? That's great content! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're not gonna get
cancelled for that, if anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you'll be immortalised on the internet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> as the one dude who shit farted himself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Think about the amount of subs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd get for shitting
yourselves on stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I could just see it, you
know, you say something racist, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you end up on FOX being
like, 'liberals are trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cancel this man, for being
racist in his sleep!' </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just imagining what if, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a VTuber shit themselves on stream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Can you imagine the super Chat for that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it would be like,
'I'm weirdly turned on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Here's 500 bucks.' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thanks for that. I needed that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my god. How do we, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> we've gone on a really weird tangent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was the subathon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ah, the subathon,
yeah I mean, I've like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Twitch content's gone crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Talking about like, watching him sleep, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just like, the Chat going
crazy and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I watch it and I'm
like, weirdly engrossed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not because he's sleeping, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just because of like, the reaction itself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of like, how active this Chat is, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this is literally just The Truman Show, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we are watching The
Truman Show happen to us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But he can't leave his room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> At least in The Truman
Show you can walk around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah. That's true. But I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this is kinda like the closest
we've had to The Truman Show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And its, fascinating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It would drive me insane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its a fucking Black
Mirror episode. It is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And its fucked. Its fascinating. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. But its also like, I
just, find it really weird that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what the mentality
of people is, where like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you watch this dude sleeping on stream, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you think to yourself
'I'ma drop a hundred subs.' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> While he's asleep. Because
like, normally, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd like to think if I
dropped a hundred subs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would want him to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'yo, thanks for the hundred subs!' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, at least a tiny bit of recognition </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from the person who I'm
subbing it to, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But its just like, he's
not gonna see this at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'ma just drop 500 bucks just like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Just because I can.
Its like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what the mentality
of it is, because like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I've given subs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think anyone does at this point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. Because like, I've
gifted subs before on stream, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> right, on like, other people's
Chats or whatever but like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dropping a hundred subs on
a dude who's fucking asleep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Its like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what goes through your head to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'yeah, I'ma do that.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean I think its
just being part of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this experience, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I feel like,
this is, you feel like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the thing about Twitch that, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I kind of understand is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you do feel like, you're
being a part of something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bigger than yourself, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I feel like, especially like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously he didn't think
it would be this successful </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that it was a fucking a genius move. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like, one day
in he made like, $150,000 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or something. So even just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know he he doesn't
seem like the kinda guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who gives a fuck about the money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I mean, but he's gonna. He's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But there's also a part
of me where its like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I just threw away my
humanity for $150,000. Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its like, sign me the fuck up! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Film every part of my life for $150,000? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro I will shit myself for $150,000. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I will poop myself
on stream for $100,000. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Any billionaires wanna? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Trash Taste shitting special, let's go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Any billionaires wanna fund this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The next Trash Taste livestream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> look out for one of us shit
farting live on Twitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just thought of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the most cursed content I can think of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just lock people in a room and just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> see who shits themselves first. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They can't go to the toilet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's Mr Beast's next video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's Mr Beast's video, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Last person to shit themselves
wins a million dollars. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its like, survivor, just with shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jimmy I just gave you
a fantastic idea, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't have to give me credit for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh. Oh my god. Where do we go from here? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know mate. I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just find it fascinating
bro, its like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you see a content creator
like Ludwig on Twitch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where he's just fucking doing something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that is not exactly the most unique thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but its also that one
thing where its like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well I wouldn't fucking do it so obviously </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no one's gonna do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. But I'm just like, when it gets </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to this point of like,
yeah I've been streaming </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> for two weeks straight like,
can it go up from there? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, what is gonna be the next thing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everyone's gonna be waiting
for the next subathon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm just like, god no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And its just gonna
be even longer, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, please no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like, that's like, I don't think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> there'll be a subathon
that'll be as popular as this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because he was the first one who did it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Unless he does it again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, even if he does
it again I feel like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the hype wouldn't be as big
because, unless, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Unless it prematurely fizzles out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where its like, oh what. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't even know when
this one's gonna end yet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So who the fuck knows?
I mean its kinda like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> do you remember Twitch Plays Pokemon? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, yeah. I was
actually about to say right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the last time I saw this phenomenon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> was during Twitch Plays Pokemon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah that's the kind of shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna be telling my kids about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, honestly, I enjoyed the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Twitch Plays Pokemon
experience so fucking much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Hey son, remember that time
when Twitch Played Pokemon? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'No, Dad.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But its like, the Ludwig
thing is like, its like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Twitch Plays Pokemon, but
instead of an algorithm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just reading the Chat, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> its literally just a dude
reading everything in the Chat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being like, 'okay left, down, up, A' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, to explain Twitch
Plays Pokemon, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this was how many years ago now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Five. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh god, like, five or six years ago? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Five or six years ago, where
someone made, like, someone, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was an Australian dude, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was it an Australian dude? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, basically someone made a program </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that would allow the Twitch Chat to play </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a full game of Pokemon, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I think it was Pokemon Red? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah it was the first gen Pokemon, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was played. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] And basically, the
Chat could put in their inputs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] For fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, and
whatever inputs were put in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> would be inputted into this emulator </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that would be played
live in front of like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah so if you typed in 'left' in Chat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and entered it, then the program
would, in order, go left, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but the trick is, there
was literally what, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 50,000, 100,000 plus people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, watching this stream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Watching and Chatting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And Chatting, like, at the same time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its like giving the Game
Boy to 100,000 people at once. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And being like, finish this game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. And its one of the few times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where the word 'social experiment' </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually meant 'social experiment', right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, it reminds me of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I saw a clip the other day and it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'if the moon landing
happened with Twitch Chat' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they were like literally
just put like, an overlay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was like, 'Pog! Pog, its landing!' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Its such a good video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I imagine how much more hype
would the moon landing be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with a bunch of pogs and shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh. Dude. I absolutely
would be pogging the Chat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Screen warping) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - This video is sponsored by Liquid I.V. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] When you push your body hard, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or just feel run down, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> its extremely important to stay hydrated. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> you get two to three times

<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly? Every time I'm hungover now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I take one of these bad boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I honestly feel a lot better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well yeah, its like, doing
like, water times three. Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its just like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It does help, actually. Memes aside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Wait. What flavours do we have, Garnt? </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> of their cellular transport technology. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (screen warping) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would love to see sporting
events with Twitch Chat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, can you imagine how fun
the Olympics would have been? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If it was streamed on Twitch? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well its funny you say that because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I recently, someone in my
Twitch Chat notified me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of this Twitch channel that
streams the sumo on Twitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dead ass there are people,
every time one of them wins, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there is dead ass just a stream of 'pog'. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, this is weird, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that people are pogging a sumo wrestler. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There'll be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking professional
back seaters coming out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like, you know, I'm sumo wrestled a... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, this technique's
pretty fucking lacklustre. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here's how I would have
optimised that match. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly this is just sloppy behaviour. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Dude, I saw a clip that popped
up on my YouTube as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was like, Twitch Chat
goes crazy about car stopping. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it was just, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a camera that's watching
a street with a stop sign? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, a security camera footage? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And
they're just streaming it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you can see Twitch Chat in the corner </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and no one stops at the stop sign, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but then one car stops at the stop sign, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and Twitch Chat goes fucking crazy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like, 'who's watching this?' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Why is there hundreds
of people watching this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Going crazy? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's really funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like, its the equivalent of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> do you remember the DVD logo, on like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the DVD screensaver, and it
like, hitting the corner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Actually is there a stream of that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There probably will be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I bet there would be a stream. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guaran-fucking-tee
there is a stream for that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I can imagine when
the DVD thing hits the corner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Twitch Chat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pog! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The amount of pogs in chat, man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the amount of pogs in chat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every time its so close
its like, ah MonkaS. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But no like, yeah, going
back to Twitch Plays Pokemon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, part of the amazing
experience of that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> being like, being part
of something bigger, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I just loved the lore that came out of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Twitch Plays Pokemon, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What law? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You weren't on the subreddit
and everything like that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wasn't on the subreddit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its like, factions forming
against each other, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And stuff like that, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. So you know,
what happened is, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was a random game
played by Twitch Chat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or not random, but it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like, a game
played by a lot of people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a lot of random things happened, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and out of this randomness, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the community just created
a kind of storyline, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they created a narrative </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of the chaos that
was happening, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course they did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And so, we're going full circle now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because an entire lore was created </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of the chaos and the randomness </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was happening on
Twitch Plays Pokemon, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. And so like, people
got invested in this narrative, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people got super, super
fucking invested in this lore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - My god! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The helix fossil. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And the helix fossil, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I mean yeah, I
know that's where like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the whole like, Lord Helix meme came from. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but like, that's the extent I know of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then there's like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just, they wanted more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Some people, like, a half
the people wanted more order, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and half the people wanted the chaos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And there was just
like, arguing and stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was quite interesting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, the only thing I remember
from Twitch Plays Pokemon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is, or, they eventually finished it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I think they released
their starter within like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first like, hour or something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think people were
trying to sabotage... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. People were trying to sabotage... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because obviously they were, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And obviously then the
whole Lord Helix thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But other than that like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, at first when I heard about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh I have to fucking go onto this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And participate and somewhere I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I gotta be part of this history. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The moment I went in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the chat is moving so fucking fast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where it just like, looks like a blur. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, I
remember I typed into... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, nevermind, I'm good! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I typed in a command and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, I didn't see it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly! I was trying
to catch it being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well I didn't see it. Fuck it, whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No because like, I mean
there was like, so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> epic moments created out of
the most mundane situations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I remember there was
this one ledge that took like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking, eight hours to cross. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] No, I remember this, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] And it was like, the
most epic ledge of all time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I watched that collectively, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> three hours at least, of my own time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know, we talk about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'what is the mentality of people
watching someone sleeping' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, wait a minute, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just watched three hours
of this video game character </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to cross a fucking ledge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have, I can't act like
I'm better than anyone else, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I fucking did that as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh my god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We need like, a category
of competitive gaming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where its like, a team does
like, everyone gets one button, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh my god. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, Dark Souls but
everyone gets one button each. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well actually one of
my friends, they're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> a couple streamer and they
do split control Sekiro? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So like, one of them is on the mouse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and the other is on the keyboard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they beat the whole
game on split controls, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like, this is
the type of shit that's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> why. Why would you subject
yourself to this pain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can barely play Sekiro
with both of my own hands. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let alone having the fucking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and also like, they manage
to beat the whole game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without getting mad at
one another? I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that's not how it works. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Scripted! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, scripted! Fake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's wrong with you two?! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's wrong with you two? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you seen that one
Twitch streamer who like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> plays League of Legends
with the most random inputs? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it RossBoomsocks? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't, I don't remember but. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It might be like, bananas? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like, he played... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - He played League of
Legends using bananas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> As inputs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Because I think
its not that difficult, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you just need something that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> because there's only really
like, four major buttons. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you just need to have
something that takes four inputs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can literally
do that with anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. Right. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No I mean, that's why I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been watching more
stream content right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I think to me as a
YouTube creator, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we watch a lot of YouTube and I feel like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we can definitely see the formula
of good content on YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and its rare nowadays that,
I look at a YouTube video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, 'wow, that is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're doing something
really original right now,' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I mean, you know,
we had a few years go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where Mr Beast completely
revolutionized the platform, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - and now it just feels like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he's the one coming up with
the original ideas, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Mr Beast, like, head and
shoulders about the rest. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I feel like, he's someone who is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one, is someone who
understood the platform. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And two, now has the resources
to do the craziest ideas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that literally no one else
can even think of doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No one else can do. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - True. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, who the fuck just
makes a fucking burger chain? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For content? Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, who else can do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who else can do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dead ass, when I saw
that video in my sub feed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, 'its a wrap, guys,' like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he just won the game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its kinda crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Like, you know, there's, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not to say there's people not
doing good content on YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the amount of original
ideas you can put on YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like, there's
a lot less now because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> one, someone with bigger
resources and is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably smarter than
you is probably doing it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And two, I feel like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of the original content
I see is now on Twitch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I don't know if that's just because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not being recommended
the right videos on YouTube? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. No I definitely do just think that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> right now we're kinda being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a golden age of like, Twitch creativity. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, there is just so many
ideas that people thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would be like, either too much
effort or wouldn't, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> reap the benefits of doing it live. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because there was just,
so much room for error. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But now, people have gone to the point, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's enough people,
I feel, now, on Twitch, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's at least one
person who's gonna be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'this might be risky, for
a lot of different reasons, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'ma just try it,
and see if it lands.' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And a lot of the times, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it does land in ways that
no one was really expecting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean like, 'oh, you
can do that on Twitch?' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it be really fucking
successful, well then, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna try and do it too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And its just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, I feel its just, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> feeding the creativity to
more and more streamers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like, we're past the point of just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get in front of a camera and
just start playing a game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're way past that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if you were ever like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> watching Twitch, and this
is the thing though, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> marbles was like, a
huge thing at one point? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Marbles? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Like, watching a bunch
of marbles go down a course, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like, seeing which one won. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, Rude Goldberg machines, or like? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, just like, it was
like, there was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> simulations of of like, marbles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And people would like, bet on the marbles. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I think Ludwig did this as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh I think Tectone did it as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, its just you
can assign things like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the balls and just like,
let all these balls go down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whichever one wins you like, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, kinda like, Salty Bets? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know what that is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Salty Bets is, I'm not
100% sure about this, but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I believe someone made a
like, a program, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where its, they pitted two
characters against each other, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in a fighting game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not sure what the fighting game was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know what you're talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They had like, fucking
Sonic going against like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Chun-Li or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know what you're on about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. Its not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And people would be
betting on the winner, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> even though it was completely,
you know, AI battle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, its just like, the streamer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't remember exactly
because I never watched it fully </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because its really confusing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] I think its like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They were like, reacting to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these marbles, these virtual
like, games going down? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was really bizarre. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Its like, horse race
betting, but like, weirder. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I find that like, stuff
like that does well on Twitch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're overreacting to dumb shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well that's the whole
reason why at one point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or I mean, I would
argue, still to this day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> people love watching people
do Gacha on stream, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because its like, people losing their shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to PNGs. Its like, well of
course I'm gonna watch this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is ridiculous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'ma watch it and play
a part of it as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can say that because
I've done Gacha on stream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I have overreacted, and
its been fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my god! I got something out of there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got a waifu! You know, its like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> its the same philosophy, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, like, its just a
PNG, bro, its just a PNG. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its a PNG man, but then, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the amount of pogs I'm
seeing in the chat is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> saying otherwise! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No because yeah, I guess to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the one thing you can get
away, you can do on Twitch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or live streaming that you
can't do with YouTube content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is you just really have this
community aspect, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And its something that, I
feel is getting more and more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, before it was seen as like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> YouTube comments are just
the thing that comes after </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the content, its the
reaction to the content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But now like, the comments itself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the reaction to the
content that's being made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is also part of the content itself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's what I see
being like, kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the future of online content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and how its kind of evolving right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> At least that is, that's how I see it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because there's like, even with like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Twitch streams that have
been put on YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, I feel like,
half the fun is lost </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if they don't have the Twitch
Chat on the content itself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because you miss a lot
of the context itself, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and if its just like, a stream highlights, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> without the Twitch Chat
itself, I feel like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're missing half of the content itself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No I absolutely agree like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel a lot of it gets
taken out of context, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where like, if you don't see the reaction, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it doesn't seem as
epic? As it actually is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, its still epic, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but when you see a
Twitch Chat on the screen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> going fucking crazy you're
like, oh this is really epic! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, this is an epic
gamer moment right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if its
just placebo or whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but its like, the moment
you see a hype Twitch Chat, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> suddenly you're like, well I
have to get hype too, fuck! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Because when
you're watching on mobile, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> who the fuck has the
chat open on the side, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it like, squishes down the Twitch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its like, I'm not gonna
fucking watch this shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the chat box here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its like, put it, just,
put it on the stream, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then that way its the
best viewing experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> as well, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I mean like, I don't
watch Twitch on the phone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most of the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes I wanna watch
Twitch and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ill watch it every now and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like, oh if I'm on the
train somewhere, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, oh someone's streaming or whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, I guess, do you
guys watch a lot of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Twitch and live streaming itself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or do you watch the highlights? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mostly just like, jump
into one of my friends streams, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if they're streaming, just say hi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, normally I watch
my mates streaming, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ah so what are you up to, huh? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its just kinda like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I literally use it as an excuse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to just catch up with my friends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Its like, I could like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> message you on Twitter
DMs or whatever, but like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're here right now,
you're gonna respond to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do watch highlights too, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just not as often? I prefer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I still prefer a normal
YouTube videos on YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. Right. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I don't, there's
so much shit I gotta watch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, anime, and I love watching anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Anime? What is that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know right? I don't know her. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, yeah I wanna keep
doing all the things I like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So its difficult to keep up everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, its kind of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's just so much content
that I wanna watch now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and there's not enough time anymore. Like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, tell me about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally can't get more
first world problem than that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's just too much to do! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's just too much content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What am I supposed to do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's too much
content, man. Life sucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> In a good way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In a good way, yeah. Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I mean like, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Here's a question for you guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you like, when you
watch YouTube and Twitch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you feel like its part
of your job to watch it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or do you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. No. I don't. I still
feel like I'm, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> back in 2013 watching my
favorite content creators. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The only change is now is that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, oh shit they follow
me, maybe, on Twitter. Maybe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> They probably don't. But maybe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, like, in a
way, to me, it kind of is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Its like half half for
me, because its like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, there are some
videos that just pop up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on my recommended where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is so little to do
with what I do for a job </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it just becomes entertainment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then there are parts
of me which are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could like, say, watch
a video idea, or a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that has this particular idea
that I had no idea existed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And there's, I'd be lying if I said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there wasn't a part of me that thinks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'oh I wonder if I can use
this idea this video's using, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and kinda spin it in a way
for my own content.' Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its like, its not so much like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm going out onto YouTube </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just trying to find the
next idea or whatever, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But sometimes, there are some videos, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where its just like, 'I could do that?' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But in like, a kind of fun and
unique way for myself, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because I do that as
well where I watch YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I watch Twitch, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm constantly looking for
ways to improve my own content. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And seeing some things
that I can maybe like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not one on one ripping
someone off, but like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> taking an aspect and being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'I can put my own spin on that,' right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, like, you know,
there have been moments </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I have made entire videos
based off ideas from like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> three or four completely unrelated videos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And just kinda being
like, Ill take you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this idea from this video, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and this idea from this
completely separate video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And what do you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I've come up with something
kinda cool and unique </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I can work off of as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is, kinda unique and
interesting to my audience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah because like, I think there's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> its really looked down upon? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if its just
the creator community, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or even like, whenever
with an audience as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever you see something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that kinda resembles someone else, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just like, 'ah,
you're just ripping off X'. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or 'you're just ripping
off Y,' whereas like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, to me, like,
artists, like, musicians, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like, you know, movie makers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like, really open
about their influences. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Some of them wear their
influences on their sleeves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And people are just like, 'cool!' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and I don't know
why its looked down upon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the YouTube space because
everyone's exactly the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's been influenced by someone else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the platform, and its really like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the rarer thing is finding someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who's completely fucking original. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like, even to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of the biggest content
creators where, in my minds, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they did something completely
original content like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for example, NakeyJakey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I feel like he's doing
something very, very different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from what other people are doing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> even he says 'oh yeah,
I'm kinda just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> JonTron up on a green screen,' and... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I think, yeah, I
think he's just saying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 'I'm just a shittier JonTron
on an exercise bike.' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what he said in
a video, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, you know, you obviously like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> its so obvious you were
influenced by JonTron, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it doesn't matter because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you're putting your own
spin on it, in a unique way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're putting your own
personality on it, where now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this supposed thing you ripped
off has just become you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] All right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean you know, I
don't really give a shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if someone does one of my video ideas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, you can 100% just take it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, if you're gonna 100% take the idea, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it would be nice to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'ah I got this idea from this person.' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because if I blatantly copy a video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll just be like, oh yeah... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean like, who was that person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> who just blatantly copied Mr
Beast for the longest time? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey and Connor] Morgz? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean like, on that
level, its so obvious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that its just kinda like,
kinda like a one to one copy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Copying thumbnail,
title is a little much, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because you might be
fucking with things there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, taking the video
idea is like, whatever, I mean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, I mean, I've seen, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a bunch of YouTubers who have
done videos that you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have come up with, or I was known for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I've been okay with it because they've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> put their own spin on it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where its just kind of become like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well I know where you
got influence from, but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This has just become your video now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I'm fucking okay with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If it was like, one for one like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ripping like, using the
same type of thumbnail, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> using the same type of title, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then the content
is almost one for one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then you don't mention
the person you got it from, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> then yeah, I'll be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> well that's a little bit
shitty isn't it? Like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because like, one of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the biggest questions
I get asked is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how do I go about like, a
new content creator is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'how do I go about making content? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How do I go about making original ideas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and finding my own style?'
And like, I always say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'you know what, I don't see any problem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with just starting by copying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some of your favorite creators,' right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because you will find your own style, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the more you do your own content, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but its not something
that you immediately like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> its not something that you
immediately figure out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And even like, some people do, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but those are the rare, rare people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, those are like,
the true geniuses, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Its like, not everyone
on YouTube is a genius. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah and I think it should be fine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for creators in our field just to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wear their influences on their sleeves </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just be open about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, not completely copying, but like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> every like, every, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone has their influences </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everyone continues to
evolve from different people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they see on the platform. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> At least that's how it is with me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it should be fine, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think everyone's being
influenced by each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because everyone, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know a single YouTuber
who doesn't watch YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, I mean, that's
the reason why we're here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I mean, you know, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I always get reminded of that
Picasso quote which is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "good artists copy, great
artists steal." All right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And like, a lot of people, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of take that quote
completely out of context. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Thinking like, well then I'll
just fucking steal things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually read up on why he said that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and what he meant by that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is a great artist
steals in the sense that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they take an influence and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they turn it into something of their own. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I feel that's very
valid to any creative field, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whether that be an artist, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or a movie producer or a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where its like, you can get
influenced by other people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but its, you have to do
it to the point where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you put your own thing on it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it becomes your own thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right? And that's really hard to do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know, great artists
steal, good artists copy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - YouTubers who just copy an idea, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but don't do anything creative with it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are the ones that are just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well you're a fucking copycat aren't you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that oh, did
you wanna say something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I never really thought about
it much, I was just like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just watched YouTube and make my videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're getting awfully
philosophical about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here we are, I'm just sitting in my, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I make fucking stupid videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's kinda how I view it.
I'm just like, all right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ill keep uploading the same shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, yeah, I'm like
that too, but you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd be lying if I said there
wasn't a part of me that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> did think about that. Like, oh god. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, this is a cool idea,
and I want to, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> incorporate it and do it
because it just seems like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> something fun to do, but. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know. I sometimes
get worried being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are people gonna come out and be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'how dare you steal this
X and X's idea,' right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think about stuff like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I just also remember like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> some of the most popular videos are like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pee pee poo poo stinky, and like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that sharting sound effect so like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> The moment I try and
get all deep about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, 'I don't think its that deep,' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think its just people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> uploading stuff that makes them hehe XD. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean I do think you register it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Subconsciously, yeah. I definitely do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I feel like,
you know, when people ask </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'how do you like, what does it take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to become a successful
YouTuber,' a lot of things that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the one thing that a lot of
people don't mention is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> step one, I feel like, is
to watch a lot of YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Well, yeah. Of course, like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. Because I mean, you say of course, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I know people who don't
watch too much YouTubers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or if I'm just like, name
ten to twenty YouTubers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh like, they see YouTube on the news, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're like, 'I wanna be a YouTuber.' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I feel like, not a
lot of people talk about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of YouTubers I know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they watch a fuck ton of YouTube, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And it feels like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are so many subtle things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can't really explain to someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless they just understand the platform </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they watch a fuck-ton of YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And its not just watching
a fuck-ton of YouTube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> its watching a fuck-ton
of different YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its like, I could be
like, name ten, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTubers and if all of them
are the same type of content, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> then its like, well, you
understand that type of content, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But everything else is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just a complete blank to you, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're probably not gonna go very far </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you're just, gonna be recycling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the same content from
those ten YouTubers, but. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or its just like, watching
YouTubers who were popular </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, five years ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I still watch Ray
William Johnson every day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I strive to be my own
equals three one day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - My day doesn't begin
without the Ray William. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And yeah, I just think you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the idea of like, yes I would
like to become a YouTuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they are successful
now, and you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they make lots of
money for an easy job, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah. And I feel like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> step one for even consider
becoming a YouTuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or a streamer, is just to
watch a fuck ton of things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on that platform. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no. Step one is
delete your Twitter history. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You've probably got some bad shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't wanna get cancelled for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Should probably, should
probably get rid of that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Then step two is watching. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Privatise your Facebook,
delete your Twitter history. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because I mean
that's how I feel about like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Instagram and TikTok, because
I don't use those platforms, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm not gonna try to grow
on those platforms because. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because you don't use it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because the first step
is I don't understand it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So its kinda like, to me, its just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the 'hello fellow
Instagrammers' kinda thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If I try to like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just turn into one of
those corporate brands, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its like, 'yes, we understand you.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here's more picture of my food, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's what you all like, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why aren't you liking it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, I mean is there anything else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys wanna talk about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know man, YouTube can be deep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but it can also be poo poo pee pee stinky. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that's what I've
gotten out of today's episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What I've gotten out of
today's episode is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't understand
streaming content sometimes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's why I watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you know, I feel
a lot of the reasons why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people watch a lot of
YouTube and you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Twitch streaming and stuff
like that for you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people who want to get into it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they want to understand it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They want to grow a greater
appreciation towards it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, that's why I watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just fucking fascinates me, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Twitch, Twitch is fascinating to me now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's why its probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the content that I'm
watching the most right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, until
I understand it fully, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna keep watching it, I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You get addicted, Garnt,
to everything that you do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I, that's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you do tend to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like this one thing now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna like it 'til the end of time! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Garnt will just come back and be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> guys you won't believe it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I've just discovered this
thing called mahjong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And me and the boys at r slash mahjong </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have been talking about
all the different strats, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and been watching... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm in this photo and I don't like it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've watched the movies with the boys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and its like, all right, calm down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And Garnt forgets about
mahjong the week next. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, he's like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's pretty much me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I'm the kinda guy
who finds it really easy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just to fall into this
one random rabbit hole, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (affirmative murmuring) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I reach the
bottom of that rabbit hole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, okay.
Time to find something new. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Time to claw out of this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally the Toy Story meme of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'I'm done with you.' </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't wanna play with you anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, yeah.
That's me in a nutshell, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the thing is, I'm
so easily influenced. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All it takes is just one
random YouTube recommendation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or one thing popping up
on my Twitter to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I find this thing, this
piques my curiosity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let me look into this, and like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a week later, I'm just like, guys, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have just consumed a
week's worth of content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on horseriding. Like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your thing right now
is fucking Chug Jug. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what that shit
is. And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just thinking to myself like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll just let him talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because by next week he'll be
talking about something else. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> He'll be done with this
rather shallow rabbit hole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - He'll get over it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He'll get over it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just see me in a week guys, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I've become a Fortnite gamer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to be a pro Fortnite gamer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We can be pro Fortnite... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know what I won't
get over? Our patrons. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true, they're wonderful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like this guy right here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I absolutely love this guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> This is a rabbit hole I
will never get out of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Please, feel free to fall down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the Trash Taste rabbit hole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There is definitely a
Trash Taste rabbit hole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, absolutely, and if

<SPEAKER_01> - Yes. Lets see how deep we
can make this rabbit hole go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just want this, the lore
on the Trash's subreddit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to just get absolutely
fucking out of control. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Where its like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're just throwing
in big YouTubers like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing shit now, its like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'horse riding, the, Felix
said the word trash. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> We have to add that to the lore.' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Its got nothing to do with anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its true, it should be on the lore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We always want to, we just want to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expand this universe as far as it will go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just want to get a the point
where the Trash Taste lore </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> competes with fake lore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Trash Taste cinematic universe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - TTCU. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, thank you. Thank you
for joining me today, Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna go sleep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you for joining me, Connor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've had like, three
hours of sleep today, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm ready to die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like you're like that every week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No this week is an exception. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was great and then the
last half hour I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> whoa, I'm tired. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I noticed, I
looked over and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you gonna add to this
