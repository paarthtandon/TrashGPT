<SPEAKER_06> - I wanna get better at pen spins again. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just do it with muscle memory now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't even think about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I hold a pen and I just start doing it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I used to be able to do
that one and then the one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where you flick it and
then it goes back it back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it goes back, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I can't do it anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I can only do that one.
(pen clatters) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laid-back music) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How many like useless
skills have you ever learned </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in your life? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just my entire life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> My entire life is a list of useful skills. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every video game ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Every video game ever. I think one day- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What counts as a useful skill? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, like the reason I learned pen spinning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is 'cause I fidget. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I guess we just started, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the reason I learned pen spinning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is because I just really like to fidget, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as you guys know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- So I thought to myself, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if I fidget all the time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> might as well make it look cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> You know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that's literally the reason I learned </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how to do the pen spin thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just did it 'cause
I was bored in class. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Otherwise I'd probably
just like start chewing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on the pen or something, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know. I was like,
I was definitely that kid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - What about like the people who like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Felix does this with the knives. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The knives?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wanna- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, you can't really bring
a knife to school, can you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - How do you even get into that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, "Hey, teach." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do you learn and get into that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then start doing it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd be way too scared to try. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not about learning
or getting into that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause there's so many YouTube
channels that, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> teach that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's having the commitment to be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm going to learn this now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm going to spend time
learning this skill, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which I don't ever know if I'm gonna A, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, gonna be able
to use this in my life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Or again, what's a skill that's useful? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Actually. Why did you learn
how to solve a Rubik's Cube? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause I've always just wanted to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- 'Cause again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, imagine you're
the only Asian kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a white school, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> So, you're just like given
these like insane expectations </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to do these like crazy skills, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Like people never believed me in school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when I said that I couldn't play chess </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just 'cause they're like,
"But you're the Asian kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You're the smart kid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You should know how to
do all these things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you can't play
Shogi you can't play Go?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "No." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's like, fake Asian. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And so, and Rubik cubes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are a bit like stereotypically, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are they? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Are they though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Back when I was in school it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - By the way, welcome to Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> We just jumped right into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Welcome to another
episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm Connor featuring the
boys, Garnt and Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Me, the Rubik's Cube player. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Rubik's Cube kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, and like I always like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it was one of
those things that I feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you go to like any house.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And there's like a high possibility </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it's just kinda like sitting there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as like an ornament, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like very rare, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd say like out of 10 houses
that have a Rubik's Cube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nine of them probably
have like a thin layer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of dust on top of 'em
'cause it's just like, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like a cool little knick-knack </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to put on the shelf, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - To make my- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like that coffee table book, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, that like no one
actually reads when it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, you read this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And they're like, "Yeah.' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like iconic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know. It's like a piece- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like how often do you get to flex </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> your Rubik's Cube skills? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If it's not like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Only on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If we didn't have like a
Trash Taste Rubik's Cube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How many times in your life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have like you gone to a party </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're like, "Oh my
God, it's a Rubik's Cube. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Guys, I'm about to flex." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Step back.
- Step back, guys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here comes the Asian kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think everyone who knows
how to solve a Rubik's Cube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> says they don't regret it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, they don't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> They've very (cross-talking). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess it's like weirdly
an impressive skill to have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I promised them a video,
I was gonna learn it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not that hard. I actually
learned it once as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I learned it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I've completely forgotten
it, but I remember like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Couldn't have been that
easy then? It's not that hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I forgot it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I learned it in a day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because like I remember
I was in a hotel room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was staying in this
hotel and for some reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like this, you know,
it was like this chic hotel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> they tried doing like different things </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with their decorations and
it just had a Rubik's Cube </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that was unsolved in this
like really clean hotel room. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - And my like OCD mind was
just like, how dare they? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not perfect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How dare- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like they fucking designed this room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like just mildly infuriating. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Just to like, it was a
perfectly clean room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It looked amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But on the desk there was
just a Rubik's Cube on there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like those memes of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just see a picture and it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what's wrong with this image? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, yeah, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like I could not sleep
in this like hotel room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knowing that there was like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like staring all
night at this Rubik's Cube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was just unsolved. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- And so I just took a day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I just Googled how
to solve a Rubik's Cube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I could fucking just like solve it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before I went to bed, learn how to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it like, I never really
thought about how to solve </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a Rubik's Cube before and I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> oh, it's actually pretty simple. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just an algorithm basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just a bunch of like algorithms. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you're following a
guide, it's pretty easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the hard part is being able to do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> independently of a guide.
- So, I never got to the point </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it was just like
muscle memory, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was just like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was just like, you know,
it was a slow process, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but anyone's able to solve a Rubik's Cube. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I also remember like
the reason why I actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like finally learnt how to solve it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause I always wanted to solve it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> since I was in high school, 'cause again, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I got, you know, called that kid. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> But then, you know, pandemic hit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> everyone's stuck inside
and it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I think everyone had that
point where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, I need to fucking
do something, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can only play so many hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of Animal Crossing per day, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, it's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's only so many sourdough
breads that you can bake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly, exactly. So,
I was like, all right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> well, let's like learn a
bunch of useless skills. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, I think I learned how to
do like four or five different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> useless skills and just Rubik's Cubes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> just happened to be one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What were the other ones? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The other one was, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you've probably seen it before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you know what kendama is? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like this very old Japanese toy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that it kind looks like
a hammer with a ball. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh that one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I did that as a kid, but
I wasn't very good at it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And what is that like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's this like really
ancient Japanese toy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of like, you know, like
spinning tops and stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's the challenge? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The challenge is you have to- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, there's three different
plates on this like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it looks like a hammer.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And there's like a concave
like plate on the bottom </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's two concave plates on the side </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's like a
little spike on the top. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The regular one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah, that thing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The regular one is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you kind of turn it to the
side and you have to throw </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the ball up without
actually holding the ball </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and let it land in the cup. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Mm, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's just like the simple skill, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's like a million
different like tricks you can do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> It's kinda like yo-yoing, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Where it's like, you can just
like regularly do a yo-yo </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then there are yo-yo tricks, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Which are just like on another
level of difficult and skill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Those are cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so like kendama is
kind of the same thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, like Japan every year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has like these like kendama championships </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> where like you can
actually get like licenses </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and like certificates to say
that you are a pro kendama </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like player, if you do like
these certain tricks, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - That sounds cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And one of the tricks, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I could do like the regular cup. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause like that's fucking easy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like anyone can do that, honestly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> One of the hardest ones is
where you have to get it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so that the ball lands on the spike. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - By doing this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That sounds impossible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's a trick to it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> But then I was like, I'm
gonna learn how to do that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> during this pandemic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, I bought like a proper
like professional-graded, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like kendama because they have those. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's like toy ones and then there's- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Professional-graded. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, there's like a kendama- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is a serious player. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's like a national
kendama committee in Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where they're like they
look at each kendama </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're like, "Yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can use those in competitions." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it comes with like a
certificate to be like, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is a certified kendama.
- So, did you learn how to do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I learned how to do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, now you've gotta
bring it into the office. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like curious now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You can't say that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> They better be a video on screen
right now of Joey doing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - How have you never like posted a video </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> on Twitter or something? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's like the most
niche thing on the planet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would like to see you.
- Okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just randomly like
in the next Anime Man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or Joey video, you just like have, well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just casually do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Just don't explain yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You just casually do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I swear to God, I swear to God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> every comment is going to be
about that one thing, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was gifted a Rubik's
Cube once as a kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For Christmas. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - By my parents. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it was a Harry Potter Rubik's Cube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. (chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, all the tiles were themed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were all pictures of Harry Potter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right.
- 'Cause I loved Harry Potter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Of course, I did, 'cause I'm British. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And so I have this cube, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm thinking, wow, this is just great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I turn it once. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh no, no, I'll put it back. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't wanna ruin the picture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like the picture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What's the point in the
cube if I (muttering). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's me and basically
every Rubik's Cube before. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, you know, and then
another day I go back to it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I turn it once, turn it
twice. And I'm like, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't, I don't want to ruin it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> And then one time I go, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> a few days later or
whatever, I love this cube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the most awful thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's so hard to solve
because the pictures are so shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, I start turning it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I turn it like four or
five times and I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna start turning it back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I turn it back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like one, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Two, oh fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not back the way it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I'm like, okay,
I think it's like just one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there's one thing out of place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can fix this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I start trying things and
I just keep fucking it up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] It just gets worse and worse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then I realized
what a shit toy this is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like eight years old. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I cannot solve this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Now, I'm just fucked. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And now if I wanna see the
picture of Harry Potter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I have to actually like
learn how to solve it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But I'm eight and I don't know how, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> no one's even began to explain to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's an algorithm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Now, I Google, I get one
hour a day to go online. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm not using that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm gonna go watch Yu-Gi-Oh!
GX, episode 400 part one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> of three hours (cross-talking). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Espanol. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm gonna do that and not
look at the Rubik's Cube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I was just like really disappointed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was really sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember I found
it a few years later </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I thought, oh, I'll give it a shot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just couldn't do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That seems more difficult
than a regular one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause the pictures were all like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like low res? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was Harry Potter and it was Hogwarts. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> So, they're all like brown. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you take like the stickers off? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, okay. I was gonna ask that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> That's what I did as a kid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then when I did
that, it wasn't, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause this was the factory,
the factory production, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the cubes were perfect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So, when I started peeling them and shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they were all like,
oh, a little bit wonky. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't get... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Stickers are some of
the most annoying shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause you put it and you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm doing it perfectly flat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You put it on. Doosh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how that happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Every time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't wanna get gum clumpy like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, right. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, fuck it. (heavy breathing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like that, but
(cross-talking) (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like I think the only like
useless skill I've learned </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> before was, I mean, do you
guys know how to juggle? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I learned how to do the one handed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Learned how to do the one handed juggle? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But like, you know, with two
balls where you kind of like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I never got to the point
where it was with three. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean, growing
up in Brighton Beach, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember like one day I
just decided to just learn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> how to juggle using pebbles and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I think I can still juggle. I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I dunno, I dunno. It has been a while. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - We have to have a video
where we show each other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the useless skills we learned. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Actually, the most useful party trick, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> do you guys have any party tricks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you like can show off
in a party or whatever? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not that I remember. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like fucking Susan
Boyle, every party I go to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just everyone stops. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Actually, like the
most useful party trick </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I know is just being able to
open a bottle with anything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Oh yeah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I've done that a few times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's not just like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Every time you do it, if
you wanna just know a trick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that will take you five minutes to learn, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but will be useful in basically
every party you go to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just learn how to open
a bottle with a lighter </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or another bottle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like us not
sharing these abilities </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is like making this episode worse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's the point of us filming this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - No-one believes us. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's point of us filming this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like how often do you go to a party </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you see a Rubik's Cube there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're like, finally. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like boys, step back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Boys, my time to shine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can click my wrists on command. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (wrists clicking) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Urgh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, that doesn't sound healthy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Ah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> You got like a 80-year-old wrist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that the gamer wrist? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the gamer wrist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the gamer wrist. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - You wanna see these scars, boys? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tell me you have carpal tunnel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Say you have carpal tunnel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can just click both of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I only know like
small little things that will, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, maybe impress like
your five-year-old cousin. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- You know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're at home, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I can do like the
water droplet sound, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like that's the only thing I can do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can do the Skype thing perfectly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Skype thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Skype... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey singing the Skype ring theme) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Is that a skill? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We just like ran out
of shit to talk about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, Oh, what'd you do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Joey do that thing again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey sings the Skype ring theme) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's really
funny. (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're talking about useless skills. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That appeals to a very
like tight niche, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like you have to be on the
internet in the mid 2000s </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to appreciate that one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you do the Windows
XP shutdown noise? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Can you do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey singing the Windows shutdown notes) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's not accurate at all.
That's just me singing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing)
- Shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've never done that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Why did you think I could do that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've always been able to
do that thing where you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> hold your body up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why I've
always been able to do that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, the one that's like
through here, like that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like when you're just like on a surface </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and you can like hold your whole body. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, you mean like what
break dancers do, kind of? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've
always been able to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. You have to have like
good core strength for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess you got great
core strength, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dunno. Maybe I do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if (mutters). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - This like conversation
has just reminded me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I like I went through like a phase, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like, you know, you're a kid </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and sometimes you go
through phases, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, I remember the first
time I ever saw David Blaine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on TV doing street magic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, I want to do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That looks incredible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember like
going through this phase </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I, you know, there
was these packages, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this was before you could
just Google or YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how to do magic tricks online. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I actually had to
like pay, like send off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had to convince my
parents to send off money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to this company that like
supposedly sent you magic tricks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like magic secrets and all that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That just sounds like a
scam. (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, I'm surprised
like for the one time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in my life, it wasn't a scam. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - They actually like
sent me back like a VHS </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that I-
- Oh shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like played. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember like learning
how to do like a bunch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of these magic tricks.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm just like, great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna impress everyone around me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like there's never a moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you go to a party or
you go to a family gathering </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and like, you don't wanna be
that guy who just brings out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a deck of cards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey ya, pick a card.
Pick a card, any card. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like, you know, I know magic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have have a deck of cards
on me right now, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't wanna be that guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I've never been able to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though I learned how to
use these skills as a kid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I never was able to show them off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I mean, it's kinda like
martial arts in some way, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because, you know, talking to- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember seeing this YouTube video about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like why do people learn martial arts? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you basically
spend years of your life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You spend years and years
honing this one skill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like these moments that will only last </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe like a few minutes
of your life, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Unless you go to tournaments
and stuff like that, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause like you're training yourself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> for like that one fight
you're gonna be in, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in like whatever moment
that's going to be, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But then you spend years
building up to that moment, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and like what if you just
fuck up in that moment, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> What if all the training
just leaves your body </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in that one moment? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What if the dude's like nine foot? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't try out for this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like fuck, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> What weight are are you again? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's my weight class. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughing) I feel like
that's the good thing though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> about like doing YouTube
is that like, for me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I just use videos to do shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that I otherwise wouldn't normally do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, like with like martial
arts, for instance, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I remember, oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even remember how
many years ago this was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is like a four or
five year old video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I learned how to like backflip in a video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was going to say,
if there's one skill, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I want to learn how to do
actually, it's the backflip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - What? Just like standing? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Just standing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - A standing backflip.
- You did a standing backflip? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I did a standing backflip
once in a video. (chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was me and like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What did your parents encourage you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They're trying to get rid
of you? Like. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, I was in Japan already. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was in Japan and it was
me, Dogan and my friend Al. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you were above the
age of like 15 doing this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. This was like
four years ago. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. That's like suicide. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. And we, yeah, because we cosplayed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> as Naruto characters. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> That's the reason you
learn how to backflip </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause of Naruto? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause there was a
Naruto online sponsorship. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was like, well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I need to do something Naruto-related. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> You know what? I'll learn ninja tricks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And by ninja tricks, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean just tricking and
learning how to backflip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, so how long did I
used to learn how to backflip? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Like I think we were in that gym </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for maybe like five, six hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I learned how to do like
other tricking, like tricks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like Dogan used
to be like a fucking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like professional trickster. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that the right word? I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Professional trickster. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sounds like a Persona character. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What like hard-core? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He used to do like tricking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What the fuck?
- Are you serious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then he like hurt his
knees, I think really badly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he like couldn't stop doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But he taught me how to
like backflip and shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I did it successfully once. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- And I haven't done it since. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you think you'd be able to relearn </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and pull off another backflip? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I think what took me so long </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and I think what the level of entry is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is that you just have
to get over your fear. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what like, 'cause
I've seen people trying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to learn backflips. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that looks like a really
interesting process. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - You just snapped your
neck, just get over it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Get over the fear, you piece of shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because like it's not natural </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> for you to be like, all right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> jump and also pull your entire body back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like this at the same, like
your body's just like, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think that's cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But the one skill I learned,
I also love this channel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's Mike Boyd. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, he just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how long can it take me to learn X thing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I think I know that
ca- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I think I've seen that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's got this one video
and I really wanna learn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> how to do this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He has an umbrella and
he's holding the umbrella </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and the trick is is that
he throws the umbrella </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in front of him. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It goes like quite far away. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> And then it opens in midair
and while he's walking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he catches the umbrella as he's like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, it fully opens- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it floats down and he catches it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I want to learn how to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's so many like
little tricks like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna learn how to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, imagine you're on
like the Japanese street </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> and you're just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Connor makes whooshing noise) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like some anime shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I wanna do that with like a cap </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where like you throw the cap </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and it lands perfectly on your head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then that's not good enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you're always gonna
like pull it down, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> With the umbrella it's like immediate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like walking, you're good to go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> No readjustment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You've got the umbrella. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh no. You know, what's
a truly useless skill </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've always wanted to learn? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is to draw a perfect hand circle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah. I've seen that. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause I've seen so many
videos and every time I see it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, not, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that is the most satisfying
thing in the world. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Just like free=hand. Just like, whoosh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That one video when
the guy like does that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The guy does that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I wanna do that shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, that's a cool party trick. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That is a cool party
trick. Everyone has a pencil. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Not everyone has a Rubik's Cube, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Exactly. Exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't carry a pencil
on me all the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, no, if you're at someone's house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're not gonna be in a house
that doesn't have a drawing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> equipment of some kind. Have
you ever been in a house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they just don't
have any pens and pencils? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's my house (mumbles). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] That's just
Connor's house, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that's my house.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - True millennial right here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's pencil? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What's pen and paper, dude? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Actually. I don't think I
have a pencil in my house. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I have pens. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, there's no way,
you guys live in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> There's more paperwork
than fucking anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, pencils, pens-
- Yeah, we just use pens. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, yeah, pens, that's what
I mean like drawing things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I guess like
now that I'm thinking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Drawing equipment. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Drawing things.
- What's the word? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you calling pens- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Drawing things.
- It's drawing things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is it called? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - What are those painters paint with? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, yeah, they're drawing things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fortunately I don't
draw anything. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When was the last time I drawed something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like the sad music playing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't drawn anything
since the accident. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I haven't drawn anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just have like zero skill in drawing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and I have done for my entire
life, I think, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - We need to do like a
drawing competition now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but just a- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm somebody who also sucks at drawing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I believe it's like singing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think you're
just like naturally good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like immediately, oh,
maybe you are actually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think some people are.
- Some people are. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think you do have to practice though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, of course you have to practice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I think the last
time I drew something, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't remember what the context was, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I think I had to
draw a cat for something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey sniggering) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, it was the Netflix shoe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember 'cause it was
for Anime Club and Netflix </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I had to draw a cat on
the whiteboard or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And, Joey just made like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Joey, I was drawing this cat
and Joey could not recognize </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that was even an
animal that I was drawing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on this whiteboard. (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - He drew like a UMA. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I dunno what it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like it was not of this earth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's a UMA? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like those like
unidentified, what is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Like the chupacabra. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like that level. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like urban legend shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Chupacabra? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck's a UMA? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Ashley speaking) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Something animal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the first time I've ever- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] Unidentified mysterious animal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Unidentified mysterious animal, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is the first time.
- Like UFO. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the first
fucking thing I've ever- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, like Mothman
or like chupacabra, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like any of those urban legends. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't know they were called UMAs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - UMAs, unidentified mysterious animal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you believe any of those? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Although when I was 10,
I did believe chupacabra. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think anyone- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would you believe in chupacabra? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you're 10 years old. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You believe Harry Potter is
real when you're 10 years old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Isn't that like Mexican or something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was Mexican or Spanish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, chupacabra means
goat drinker or some shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, what is the chupacabra? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I killed it in Red Days, I killed it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I killed it in Red Days. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was this like viral video
in like early 2000s, I think. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Where like there was this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> it was Mexico or Spain or somewhere, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was some Spanish speaking country, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where like just some dudes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> went into a forest at night
'cause they heard some shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then there was this like creature </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that appeared on camera. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was like the goat person, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Yeah, it was like eating a goat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or it looked like a demonic goat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And like I remember like back then, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it was a huge sensation,
especially in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was a massive sensation
because for an early </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 2000s video, it was like
way too high quality. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like it looked way too real. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like you look at the
chupacabra videos now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're like, oh,
that could almost like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> if you weren't aware of it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that could almost come off as convincing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- 'Cause it was like too good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then people were like
shocked when they found out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was fake and it's like,
oh, who would've thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there isn't a fucking
goat drinker demon thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the forest of Mexico, or
whatever the fuck it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. I think like the only
thing that I believed as a kid </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> or I wanted to believe, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I really wanted to believe
like the Lochness Monster. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, 'cause a kid, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just obsessed with
dinosaurs and you're like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You like stories.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You like thinking cool
shit exists out there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But it doesn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like everyone, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone wanted to believe
Moby Dick was a real thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like Bigfoot, like a lot of people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weirdly a lot of people really- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That fucking image of
Bigfoot, like doing this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - People like really believe
Bigfoot for some reason. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But like it also like makes me think, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what if one of those
things was real, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What would make you actually
believe it, right? Because- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Seeing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I, yeah, if I see it, like, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> If I see like a news
article of like scientists </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like properly talking about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Having someone credible
be like, yep, this is legit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because like I remember, because I think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we have talked about this
before, but like, I mean, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's been proven by the
government that UFOs exist. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And like nobody </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> freaked out over it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Nobody really reacted to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Besides Alex Jones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean like, yeah, last year with the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what was it the black files? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- But, yeah, like it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I said to you, "Oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by the way we found an alien spaceship, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we know it's an alien, by the
way." You'd be freaking out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if you're like, "Oh,
we have no fucking clue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what that thing was." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] It could've been like a drone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everyone like doesn't,
'cause you're like, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, I'm sure there's
an explanation for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We just don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> by the way we literally found
the things from Men in Black, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> then I think everyone's
gonna be like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. I mean like, 'cause
I mean it's weird, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause you do look at the videos. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I do look at the videos of the UFO images </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and the UFO videos and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's freaky and I do think UFOs exist, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but do I think it's aliens? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I dunno myself. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I dunno how to react to it, I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Oh, go on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I was gonna say like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> there was a weird part
of me that saw those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like government file, you know, videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which are like, you know, legit, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause why would a
organization like that lie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's like, I saw it and
I was like, why does that look </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like just every other
UFO video I've ever seen? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think that's the
problem with it, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because there's so many fakes nowadays </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that even when the real
thing is actually released, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> you're so desensitized with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the fake ones
looked more real than this one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Right, right.
- Like why is that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just I thought
seeing UFOs, real UFOs, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would be more impressive.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I dunno why I thought that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I just thought it
would be more impressive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it didn't just wasn't, you know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I assume that if
an alien species finds us, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll probably be dead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why? They'll just wipe us out? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Odds are, think of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> If an alien spaceship, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if an alien civilization
had the opportunity to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> or had the capability
of finding other planets </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and going around scouting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Mm.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're more technologically
advanced than us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- We're pretty fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Odds are they're not gonna
wanna be like, hey, friends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're gonna be like,
let's take all your stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You have minerals. We need them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Collect the minerals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You require more minerals. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like fucking StarCraft. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're just gonna use us
for another (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Why would they give a shit?
They're not gonna give a fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they'll treat us like cows. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, true, true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it's like, it's kind of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I agree with you because I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what if humanity had this capability? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We would fuck over everyone.
- Yeah. We would, we would. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We would fuck everyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, we fuck ourselves over enough. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like let alone another species. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - We can't even save
our own fucking planet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> let alone some other
species planet, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anyone who thinks that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we wouldn't just blow up a planet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> if we just thought they were
a little strange looking, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they just like that doesn't
have enough understanding </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of human (cross-talking). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Especially if they have
like natural resources </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or some shit.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm sure a lot of people would be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think we should do this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but the government of whatever, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the United government of all, whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would be like bye bye, bye bye planet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bye bye, bye bye. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We'll just find another one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But they are rich in
iron, we must destroy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Exactly. Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Which, speaking of destroying planets </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and living through the
apocalypse, I guess, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we kind of- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What a fantastic segue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. What a fantastic segue. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We kind of lived through
something like that yesterday. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Didn't we?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> That was terrifying. We
had a very big earthquake. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like what you referring to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I knew immediately
what he was on about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you had a very
different experience to us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Same brain cell.
- Yeah, we have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> the same brain cell. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, we had two big
earthquakes actually </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> yesterday back-to-back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure the world news has covered it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's probably old news by the
time you're watching this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, it was the biggest earthquake </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I have lived through so far. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was bigger than the one in LA </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> or at least it felt like it
was bigger than the one in LA. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think Tokyo was like mag 4 or 5. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - 4, 4.5, I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But I think it was like magnitude 7.3. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- The epicenter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and Fukushima. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But yeah. I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought I'd experienced </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like big earthquakes in Japan before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And this one, like even for
people who have lived here, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lived in Japan for longer than me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> said that this was the biggest one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that they've experienced as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And you know, it's a lot of people said, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it's the biggest one
that they've experienced </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> since the 2011 earthquake. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - In Fukushima as well, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Because I think it was
because it wasn't just one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was like one that
was pretty big already. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That caused another even bigger one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like literally two minutes later. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, it just felt like one
continuously large earthquake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, how was it for you guys? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Am I weird? I like earthquakes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] You like earthquakes? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I quite like it. Is that bad? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like in what sense? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel like a fun, quick
time event or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause, I dunno why, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it feels kind of fun. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Is this weird? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's a bit.
- I know this is weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it is technically
a natural disaster. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I know, I know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's like it causes
so many problems, but like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's like watching a bush fire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and being like, "Sick!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know like I get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I get it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, you don't say
that about like typhoons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is the guy who gave
us shit for looking at fire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like so a canister and here he is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> being like looking at an earthquake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like, wee! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like a disaster on like
10 times the magnitude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> No more, like thousands of times </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> the magnitude of an exploding can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And he's just like, "Ooh,
a quick time in bed." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just, I dunno. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - The bayonet of music starts playing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I obviously protect whatever
is valuable in my house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But also it's kinda of interesting seeing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> what stays and what falls over. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I quite enjoy that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I understand- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Taking bets, being like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - I kinda, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, I was out and I was
kind of like hyped to think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like when I came back I was like, ooh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wonder what fell over? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like nothing had fell over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you were disappointed? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Obviously if like my TV had fell over, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd be like, fuck, that's shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you know when it's mild ones, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like obviously 'cause
it was a big earthquake, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it wasn't that big in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I like those ones, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but obviously if it was like 8, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that'd be like, I'd be
another thing entirely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Well, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do not like this one. I
do not like this earthquake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean like one thing
I do not understand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> after having lived in
Japan and experienced </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a bunch of earthquakes now is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when do they send out
the earthquake alarm? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] I do not get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I swear to God- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's when the epicenter is close enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you get one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] No.
- [Garnt] No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have never gotten one
since I got my new phone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've definitely gotten a bunch, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's only when the
epicenter is close enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to where you live, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it sets it off? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because it was in Fukushima and Miyagi, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it was like too far away. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - But the earthquake was
big enough to the fact </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we felt it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. Because I hear the earthquake alarm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and I brace myself and it's
like the piddliest, piddliest </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like little earthquake I've ever felt. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like out of nowhere, like yesterday, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you get like the entire
fucking house starts shaking. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, why didn't I
get an alarm for this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like this is like more
prevalent for like the alarm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I should be bracing myself for. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do. Have you watched
that YouTube video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like noises that
will give you anxiety </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you live in Japan or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's like all the disaster noises. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you heard the tsunami one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. The tsunami one was terrifying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's horrible, it's like the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> what's the tower in Pokemon called? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, the fucking Pokemon Tower. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like that, no, the one with the dead- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, Pokemon Towers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just Pokemon Towers? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think, no, Lavender Tower. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Lavender Tower.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like that level of
creepy, the tsunami one. </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_06> (man speaking in foreign language) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (bells chiming) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I fucking hate that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> It's horrible.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - That one's horrible, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] That one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor singing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It sounds like when you get
an item in an (indistinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It sounds like I just opened
a box in Zelda or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey singing)
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (Connor singing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's creepy because like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's slightly dissonant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it feels like you're in a
room that is like collapsing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like it's designed to do that
and it's like, you're dying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like you're in a game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and you just like triggered a bad event. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know the feeling. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Have you ever heard
like those music remixes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they take a happy
song and they remix </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it in like a minor key? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's exactly what it sounds like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You talking about like
"Wrecking Ball" in G minor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Joey gets what I mean.
Joey gets the music memes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Music memes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like Joey gets the music memes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, something in G minor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, that feels dirty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, I don't like that feeling.
- Yeah, yeah. It's demonic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> The one that always
gives me fucking anxiety </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is the earthquake alarms.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey mimicking earthquake alarm) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But that one feels dangerous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The tsunami one is creepy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it doesn't feel like it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> this is like a world ending event. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It just sounds like a minor discomfort. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like the malls
closing. Dring, dring. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Dring, dring. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Get out of the mall now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean, like for the
earthquake yesterday for me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so it was actually big enough
that it knocked out the power </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in my section of Tokyo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you just dox yourself, Garnt? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Sorry?
- Did you just dox yourself? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, it was like the
path of power got outed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in a bunch of facilities in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think the news said it
was like 2 million homes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were out of power.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't even know if mine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I might've lost power, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but I was out so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But you definitely would've
known if you lost power. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wasn't there, you see?
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You weren't at home. Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I could've gone out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mine was fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, like, I actually
didn't even feel the first one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I dunno, like sometimes
people were just like, "Oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there was an earthquake." And
I'm like, "I didn't feel it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Was there really an earthquake? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or did you just stand up too fast? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just got a head rush." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, 'cause that happens
to me sometimes, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I think it's an
earthquake happening, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's really just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just me tripping balls. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just feel like a little lightheaded. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you watching
something in Dolby Atmos? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I genuinely think there's
always an earthquake happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when I'm watching Dolby Atmos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, like the THX starts.
It's like (trilling). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, like, the floor
shakes with the Dolby, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm always like, "Oh shit, are we?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, I was actually in
my office on the bottom, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on the ground floor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I live in a house </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and Sydney was chilling on the bed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on the third floor of our house. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And I just hear Sydney
going, "Garnt, Garnt, Garnt!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, I didn't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was an earthquake going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I was just like
taking my time with her. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let me finish this piece of work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'll just like
casually stroll upstairs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I see Sydney, like
just looking shell-shocked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause Sydney's like really
sensitive to like earthquakes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like natural disaster kind of thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, she's just like, (heavy breathing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> "Did you feel that, did you feel that?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What's going on, Sydney?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "That was an earthquake,
Garnt. That was an earthquake." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "Was there? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Are you sure, Sydney? Are you sure?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like 'cause I didn't feel it at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right. Yeah, yeah.
- I didn't feel that at all. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so I, you know, I was
like about to check my phone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to see if, you know, anyone
else had posted about it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then just as I got out my phone, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it like the second quake
hit, the second quake. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The bigger one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The bigger one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's like, you know, this one, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it didn't like immediately
start off strong for me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It like shook a little bit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It shook a little bit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so it started shaking. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, "Oh, that's an earthquake." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And Sydney was like, "Huh? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, you feel it now, you son of a bitch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You feel it now? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You feel it fucking now?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then as she finished that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> our lights just like turn off. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And there was just
an immediate 180 from, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Oh, (heavy breathing)
no, no, no, come here, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> come here, please. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Come here, come here." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where are you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - All it took was the lights going out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But yeah, I mean like it was
actually like pretty surreal </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for me because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was the first time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, in Thailand we're like, fuck, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm fucking used to power outages. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We have like plenty of lights
and everything like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> In here, it was just so surreal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seeing just my entire block,
basically, my entire town, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like in complete darkness. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- I think I posted </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a video of me just like walking around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> outside my house. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I have never seen my street
almost in complete darkness. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is freaky as hell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Which, because it was the first time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd just seen any side of Tokyo, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just completely dark with
some emergency lights on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like, it was
kind of surreal, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like apocalyptic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, kind of apocalyptic, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like, 'cause I thought, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why not just take a walk just to see, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> just to see what the city is like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Take it in.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just to see what the city is like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when we're going through
a disaster like this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- And I think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the first time it hit me of
just how surreal this was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was I walk out and, you
know, Tokyo was dark, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> but the point it actually
hit me was when I walked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to my main road and I
could see the Lawsons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had its lights out, and
I'm just like, holy shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Even the combini is affected. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - That never happens. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - This is the first time I've ever seen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> the fucking combini just out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like the employees are
in there just like fucking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> they couldn't even open the
door because like the power </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like the automatic door wasn't open. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, oh, this is real. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno why it was the combini </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> just 'cause like I thought no matter what, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a comet could be
crashing and like Lawsons </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> would still be like serving. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Because like even when Japan
has like the worst typhoon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in like the past 10 years, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I think it did like
last year or the year before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Two years ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The only thing that
was open, the Lawson. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - The combini's, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The combini's are all open. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Through thick and thin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yep.
- So, that was the first time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, that was the first
time it was surreal for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it was also surreal
just seeing which parts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the grid were still supported. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mm. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, actually like, 'cause
I had to walk around. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, like it was some
traffic lights were working </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and some weren't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, that was weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow, traffic lights weren't working? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Some of the traffic
lights weren't working, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I think they must have prioritized </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the more busier intersections, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Because all like the big
intersections were working, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but some of the smaller ones- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, all right.
- Weren't working. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I always thought that
the road lights and stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> are on a separate thing
entirely from the normal- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, they might have
like a backup system. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. They normally do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause obviously the last
thing you want is no- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - No traffic lights. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - No traffic lights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, and there was
actually a traffic accident </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like near where- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not surprising at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Near where I was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think might have been because of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like the only thing
that was actually lit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> was the train stations actually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The train stations had everything working. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The elevators were still
working and everything, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even though everything
else was like pitch black. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't the only
thing that was like on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was having a great time in Akihabara. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was having a whale of a
time. I was in the basement. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right.
- In some anime song bar, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> went in there and there's
a bunch of Japanese men </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> singing Macros songs.
- Nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - With a bunch of very
young looking girls. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, we went in there and we
were just having a good time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I sang- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - You were like, "Man, I'm
fucking lighting this place </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on fire, man." (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was singing, "Colors." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor sings and laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone clapped. (clapping) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Must have thought like the base </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> of your voice was just like so strong </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that it was shaking the entire building. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did "JoJo" as well.
So, I- (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I bet everyone
in the bar was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, they got Dolby Atmos here." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Holy shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When it came, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I was with the guys that I
did the wrestling video with. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He was like, "Oh, there was
an earthquake just now." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, "Ah, I didn't know." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Then 10 seconds later, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the second one that was bigger, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> started like shaking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And we were all like, "Yeah, whoa." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause everyone was drunk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jo! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - JoJo! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then, yeah, but we were in
the basement, it was shaking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it wasn't like that bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, like that's why,
initially, I was quite shocked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> when I was getting
texts, a bunch of texts, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people being like, sorry that scared me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like ghost, ghost. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Earthquake, earthquake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why I was quite shocked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> when I was getting so many texts </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and people being like,
"Oh my God, are you okay? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Are you okay?" What, what, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, weirdly enough you don't feel it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're underground. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You feel it when you're really up higher. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - And you feel it more at least. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. You feel it way
more when you're up high. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was all right. It was good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you get a lot of people
who don't live in Japan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who don't? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who aren't used to
earthquakes messaging you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, of course.
- Oh my gosh. Are you okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - After the round of like
people living in Japan tweets </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that I saw, I started to get
like 17 messages from people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all over the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause once it hit the mainstream, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, international news. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's weird, 'cause it's like, I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like how could you
know the severity of it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I think if I'm tweeting
about it, it's probably- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It probably means I'm okay.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everybody's, oh, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean like I think it's worse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> for like someone like Chris, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause he was living right next to it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I can't imagine how strong
the earthquake was for him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it hit really hard with him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I've never been in an earthquake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> where a lot of stuff has
literally like just like gone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on the floor and started smashing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- 'Cause I think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno why, I'm oddly
calm during an earthquake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like it. You see
what I mean? It's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Woo! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wouldn't say I like it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's like, I remember like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I remember seeing
Arkie's video of, that she took, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I related to Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, of course, of course, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me and Joey sharing the same brain cell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I remember relating to
Joey so hard just seeing Arkie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just like freaking out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to the bed and Joey just sitting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a stone-cold face on the couch, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is just like experiencing
the world ending around him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> And Joey's just, this is fine. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was literally just the "this is fine" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> face look, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Arkie] Joey? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (building rattling) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (object thudding) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> (mechanical pulsing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Arkie sighing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] There was two earthquakes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Arkie] Was it a level six just hit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that was a level six. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Arkie] Fukushima. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - The one that got meme'd a lot online </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was like afterwards, it started
to like really shake, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so Arkie ran to the
other side of the house, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> like to the bed because like
we always go to the bedroom </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's nothing in our
bedroom other than our bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- So, there's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we don't have any worry about
things like falling on us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, we go to the bed,
she's like calling out to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, why the fuck
you calling out to me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're the one that left me behind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - She like bolts, bolts into the bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She's like, "Joey, where are you?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "What do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You left me in the living room." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so there's just this footage of me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like casually
strolling in with my hand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on my hip being like,
"Oh, two earthquakes." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, fucking sick. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, and people are like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> just Joey, just like as a chat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like walking in, like dad pose. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like hand on his hip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Just like, I think someone said like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> "Why does he look like a dad </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's like waiting for
like an argument to finish?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> But to be fair in my
defense, I was surprised </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I looked way calmer in that video </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> than I actually was. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause I think in those
kinds of situations, like- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Which earthquake was this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The one that happened yesterday. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, you had a video?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Arkie filmed it. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, Arkie filmed it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, yeah, I think I was surprised </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I was like, oh, I looked way calmer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than I actually was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause inside I was like, oh fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like really long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Also I was worried about my grandma </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause she lives up north. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- So, I was like trying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to text her and stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But outta context, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it just looks like me just
fucking standing there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> just like waiting for
this earthquake to end </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - End already. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - End already, fark. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I really want to go
on one of those like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I know they had it in
like "Takeshi's Castle." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They had the challenge
where you had to like sit </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> in like the Japanese tatami room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- It's on one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of those earthquake simulation things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they have to like try
and sit on the platform without </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> falling over while it's like magnitude 9. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I really wanna go in one of those. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've been on one of those. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- That sounds fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That sounds fun.
- Yeah, Arkie did a video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> at like the like emergency
center type of thing in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like where you get to
experience like a house fire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like an earthquake
and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And they have one of those things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I tried it on magnitude 9, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is the same as the 2011 earthquake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Dude, it's crazy. Like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, what does it feel like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just feels like four guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> are just surrounding
you and just doing this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you can't even, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I was sitting down like legs crossed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was sitting down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like after the first shake, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I was like lying flat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Holy shit.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You cannot even like lie down straight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's so fucking intense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so it really like
went to (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you know, when you
hear magnitude 9, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, oh fuck,
that seems really big. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But I think like actually
experiencing magnitude 9 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is another lever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Isn't it exponential? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I think they just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whoever designed the Richter scale </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> really like fucked up by
making it a logarithmic scale. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause it's not like
it's not linear, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's like by- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's logarith- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Do you mean exponential? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think that's the same thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I think
logarithmic is exponential. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the inverse of exponential. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it?
- So, logarithmic means </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it goes like this
and then exponential </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> means it goes like this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Okay. I might be wrong. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It might be- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just wanted to say logarithmic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - One of them's like this, Garnt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Make myself sound smart. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Garnt, logarithmic, exponential. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm gonna Google this
right now. Which one is it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Logarithmic means that
it peak like the gains </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that you see are initial and
then it starts flattening out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where as exponential's the opposite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Ashley speaking) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, it is logarithmic? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Thank you. Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But you were trying
to explain exponential. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I smart. I smart. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You said the right word, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but you were saying the wrong thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - No. What I'm saying is it- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We're professionals. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like exponential is kind
of also logarithmic kind of. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the inverse of logarithmic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it? I don't know
about that. I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know because like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's the opposite. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, man. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Either way it's- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not linear. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not linear. It's in a scale. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yes. Yes, Ashley? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Ashley] Logarithmic functions </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are the inverses of exponential functions. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, how is- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, Richter scale is logarithmic? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] Richter scale is logarithmic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, that means that it would, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after like four or five, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the difference isn't much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That can't be right?
- No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] It goes up this way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Exponential goes up this way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- [Garnt] No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Hence the word exponential. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It goes exponentially higher. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - This kind of just- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - This kind of just proves my point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A bunch of wrong things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I think I'm right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The original point I was trying to make </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> was that they put it in a scale </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that is not comprehendible
by the normal human person, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which we are literally proving right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, like, you hear like an 8 or 9 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> on the Richter scale and you're just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, that's just one up from a 7. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've seen people survive 7s. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like your mind can't
comprehend the effects, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like the the tangible effects </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of just how much larger that is, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that's why I think they fucked up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because if you hear like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was on a scale of like a thousand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on like this earthquake scale. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> You're like, that's a big number compared </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to a hundred, which is what
we're technically talking about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when we're talking,
going up from magnitude 7 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to a magnitude 8, right?
- Yes, yes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I think like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I dunno why we went
with a logarithmic scale </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> for like disasters when the
normal person can't comprehend </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that amount of difference with
just one number, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - True, true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, Garnt
can't even comprehend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what logarithmic and an exponential are, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so how's he gonna comprehend the scale? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think any one of us can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can, I know what it
is. I've just explained. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Ashley] Yeah, you're right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. (laughing) I know I'm right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> This is insane. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But the Richter scale
is a logarithmic scale? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that logarithmic? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, so that means that there
wouldn't be much difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> between 8 and 9. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But there is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, the scale says
that there isn't, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Oh, fuck sake. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is that right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's not much of a
difference between 8 and 9? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Ashley] Logarithmic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - But how we experience those numbers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> are all different though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> So, it's like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't wait for the comments </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> to just tear this conversation apart. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hi, mathematician here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hi, mathematician here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I literally had an aneurysm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I invented the Richter scale. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm having an aneurysm. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] Technically,
it's supposed to indicate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> an intensity 10 times the previous number. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's what- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Ashley] But it's also
described as a logarithmic scale. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> They both seem- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What does that mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I thought like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let me show you a picture
of a logarithmic fucking line. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know what a logarithmic line is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it doesn't make sense
because I've learned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that the Richter scale
is the higher the number, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the bigger the difference in scale. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] 10 times the difference. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- I thought it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like 10 times the previous number. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, 'cause what, I
mean, I guess it could be, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also 'cause it goes like this, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So, let's say this was like, if it was 8 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like at the peak or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not gonna get much better at 9. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, increased more so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, then what? Oh
my God. I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - So, that's- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I am confusion. (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - But also a logarithmic
scale also depends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the function you put into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. That's what I thought. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause the logarithmic
scale doesn't necessarily </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> have to look like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just a scale- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a scale that's not linear. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not just a non-linear scale. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> So, that is a logarithmic- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is a logarithmic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that is also what I understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to be exponential as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what I thought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's an exponential logarithmic scale. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what I thought at least. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's an exponential logarithmic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, 'cause it keeps going up. Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Either way- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Either way, my original
point wasn't the fact </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that exponentials are
the same as logarithmic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That wasn't what I was trying to explain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was trying to explain that this shit- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, either way, I'm right. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Either way, I was trying to explain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that this shit is too confusing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the normal person to comprehend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Which maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we aren't normal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We aren't the normal person. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe we're just dumber
than a normal person. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Speak for yourself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe we're just dumber
than a normal person. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bottom line, you could say
that the earthquake yesterday </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> was magnitude 7.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But if you've never
been in an earthquake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> of that magnitude, you're
not going to fucking know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what that feels like, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like you guys have never
been in a magnitude 7. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Yesterday was a magnitude
like 4 max in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. And like that's fun zone for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think 6 sounds scary. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - 6. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I wonder how big the one in
LA was that we experienced? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna say that was
probably around the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Like maybe like a magnitude 4. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It wasn't that bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It felt around the same.
- Well, it depends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like where we were wasn't
it didn't feel that bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I can't imagine what it
is Like even if it goes like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> if it's like 10 times
more powerful than that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean I've been in a 6,
is the biggest one I've been. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you know, America has the
most volcanoes in the world? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not active, but total volcanoes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whereabouts? Just Hawaii? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - The whole thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Well, I think Hawaii has
a lot of active ones. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - But in general, America's a lot- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - More than Japan? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. More volcanoes than Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow. I thought Japan had the most. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe Japan has the most active ones? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that's Indonesia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I think that is Indonesia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Japan can't be number
one for everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, America also has
like a massive land mass. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - So, I'm not like surprised about that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - America has the most volcanoes
that like aren't active, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like they like don't do anything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- [Ashley] Yellowstone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, then they have like Yellowstone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like a ticking time
bomb for extinction, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it kind of is, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If Yellowstone ever explodes,
then humanity fucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Well, same with Mount Fuji, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I think as well,
is if any volcanoes erupt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the Antarctic, I think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's some volcanoes underneath the ice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And if they explode- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Then Antarctica's just gone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, that would be the world's gone. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> That water's gotta go somewhere, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It doesn't just like go out into space? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it doesn't unfortunately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Turns into rain? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Gravity's really good
at keeping that shit in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, which like, 'cause
yesterday made me wonder, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like it made me appreciate
just how prepared are you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a disaster, right? Because- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Visos music.
- Huh? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Visos music.
- Visos music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, because we're in the
penultimate episode of Earth, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You think? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like penultimate
episode kind of vibes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, well, hold on. Wait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We got a war going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We got global warming with the pandemic, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the Earth's shaking,
trying to rip itself apart. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We're in the- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Mayans were off by a few years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, when you have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's like the disaster movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have the beginning, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the act one, where you
have all of the indicators </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that the world is ending, but
nobody pays attention to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I believe like 2020 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has like literally been
that indicator IRL. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Quick take a shot of the
seismograph, going crazy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Get that on film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, 'cause like I remember
like when the lights went out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was walking
around, I was like, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if this was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the title of the movie,
"When the Lights Went Out." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "When the Lights Went out." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> When we lost power, I was just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it made me think, what if
this was like actually just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, a super,
super serious earthquake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like the power would be out for a time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I didn't know when
they would be back on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, you'd be fine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause you have a Gigan
shaft fucking battery. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Connor singing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Which is just like, I kinda realized </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how much foreshadowing of, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm gonna call it foreshadowing, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Because it's basically a
Chekhov's gun at this point, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of items I've collected
thanks to Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that would help me
through a disaster, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> So, the first thing I realized is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> our house was the only house on our street </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with any lights on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's because I had my
fucking brick of a power bank </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I had accidentally bought
for the camping episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Which if you need a flashback, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> here's a thumbnail of the clip </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> of me talking about the brick
that I bought by accident </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the camping episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. But it wasn't by accident. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it wasn't, I didn't
know, it wasn't by accident, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the script- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - He foresaw what was gonna happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The script writers for Trash Tastes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is just like on another level, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like they foreshadowed
this like two seasons ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - (indistinct) is writing Garnt's life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - So, like I remember the lights
being off and me thinking, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fuck, I do not have any torches </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or any sources of power. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Wait a minute. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I remember, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I thought I'd never ever
actually be able to use it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for the use that it was intended for. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And luckily I had just
charged it like a week before. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> So, like we just plugged, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we could literally just plug in our lamps </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we just lit up like our
bedroom, like it was normal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Plug in your entire house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We could charge our phones and everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> But like beyond that, I was
also thinking, what if like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what if this was a natural apocalypse </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and we needed to survive
for, you know, a bit longer. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> And I remember, do we have
like a good supply of water </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or like supplies, emergency rations </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to get us through the day? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, wait a minute. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just bought an entire, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like me and Sydney both
have an entire fridge full </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of green tea that we bought
as like an aesthetic thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for our streams, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, if you've seen any of my streams </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or any of my on-camera shots, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a mini fridge that I have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's just full of
green tea that could last me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a decent amount of time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And beyond that, I also have a backup, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like an entire
crate full of green tea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I can like constantly refill this up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, unknowingly, just from
trying to make something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> look aesthetic in my background, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm able to like just survive- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You'll be pissing so much though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm able to survive. And not
only that, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do we have any food to
be able to like last us? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, Sydney's got like
10 months worth of Bokksu's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just lying about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, thanks to Bokksu, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we also have emergency rations as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've got like an emergency kit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. So, do I. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Got like quite a lot of water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got quite a lot of water? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've got like that bottle of water </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that lasts like four
years or whatever it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. There's like
emergency water that Japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> makes where it's like
water that supposedly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lasts like four or five years. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Emergency water? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it would last four or five years? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like been specifically made </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so that it doesn't go off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Water can go off? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, water can go off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? I'm still gonna drink that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> (Ashley speaking) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, water can get stagnant </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and collect bacteria and stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like they have like special, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's like akusui,
it's called in Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I've got like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 10 liters of water or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Can bottled water go off? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - After a while, like after
like a year or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, you could still drink it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can still drink it, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You'll be fine. You'll be fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've got like a bunch of food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I got a wind up torch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Got some other shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait, so you actually
have an emergency kit? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Where did you buy it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - They sell them on Amazon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just bought one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Arkie made one for a video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought if I don't use
it, I'll just whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, I looked into, I
was like, oh, should I get one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of those solar panel
battery charging things? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Turns out they're like a lot of bullshit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they like barely work. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, I was like, oh,
and then someone's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just get wind up torch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like way better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I gotta wind up torch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just get the fucking brick
shit-house battery pack, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Garnt did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. But like you gotta
keep that thing fully charged. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> If it's in my cupboard for like 12 months, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it might have half the charge
by the time I go to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Half the charge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> could probably still last you
like six months. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I'm actually probably gonna get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like an emergency pack now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause I never really thought
about it before yesterday. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It did humble me a bit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just, you know, even though just- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Even though you're
fully prepared. (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Even though I am prepared in many ways. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Thanks to Trash Taste </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and Trash Taste law and just
being a content creator. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> You know, (laughs) I didn't
purposely prepare for it, but- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sorry, go on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But, yeah, I mean, I just
have a lot of things lying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in my house that is useful for survival. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you ever watch those videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that are like what to
do if there's a nuke? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - You're like, all
right. (heavy breathing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You mean like the lie
down with your mouth open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you know that one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's that one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hold on, tell me this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Apparently I saw a video.
I don't know how true it is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but apparently it's like what
to do if a nuke explodes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like not close enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it can like immediately kill you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but its like if like the shock wave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could like possibly kill you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And apparently, I don't
know if this is true, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so please take this with a grain of salt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- But it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to supposedly lie
down with your like head </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> facing away from the blast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you have to have your mouth open </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because if your mouth is closed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then the shock wave can
puncture your lungs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What?
- But if the mouth is open, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then it lets the air
escape from your mouth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Supposedly, that's like
a trick that people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have just figured out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Again- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mouth breathers rejoice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We were talking about- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mouth breathers rejoice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We were talking about
useless skills, all right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I know that little useless skill. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That is- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or it could come very useful, who knows? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is a piece of knowledge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you see in one life
hack on a YouTube show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you immediately forget about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor singing)
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually, I wouldn't forget
that. That's very memorable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I remember, and again,
I dunno how true this is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never personally
experienced anything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, I haven't tested it myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - So, if I see a nuke going
off, I lie down on the ground. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so say if it's
coming out from that window </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> over there, you would face that way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How the fuck would you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Calculations. Oh shit. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. And yeah, you'd like
kind of have your head down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you'd like open your
mouth so that the shockwave </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> can go through your body </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rather than, 'cause if it's closed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then it gets closed off and then- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's still gonna hurt a lot, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, it's still gonna hurt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But it won't kill you is the thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like if a nuke's going off, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> your life's pretty fucked anyway, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I mean if your close
enough, yeah. (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Obviously. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think you have like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think anyone who
was like, oh here's the nuke- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hold on, hold on, guys.
- Guys, I got it, I got it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Guys, open your mouths, guys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Trust me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like the next Indiana
Jones he does like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he fucks the fridge and
he just turns around </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and with his mouth open. (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, he's like in the fridge
and he's like, "Oh fuck." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I forgot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That only works, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the only reason the fridge
technically worked, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Is 'cause it's a lead fridge, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> They don't make lead fridges anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, they don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, I can imagine a
bunch of people jumping </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in their fridges and it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not gonna do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just put yourself in a coffin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just made it- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're just gonna cook
yourself alive, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, it was like they were saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you have 15 minutes
when the nuke goes off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're not in the
immediate danger zone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're 15 minutes
before like the fallout </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reaches the ground level. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Mm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, you need to get
indoors within 15 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and not leave, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you still might be
dead from the radiation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But obviously if you
get any fallout on you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I think you die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Probably. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Radiation sickness sounds horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really, really, dude, Chernobyl, man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that HBO series was like rough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, it wasn't just that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think the one thing that
really horrified me was hearing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about that Japanese guy who was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I think he was like the
most radioactive person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who ever lived. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I remember seeing this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I saw a documentary on it or- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was it the one on the fisherman? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is this that one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't think it was a fisherman. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - He was working for, I believe, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a nuclear power plant
or something like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So, for what, I don't know the full story, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but for whatever reason, during routine </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> maintenance thing, with
when he was handling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> radioactive material, they made a mistake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> due to like time constraints </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and, you know, trying
to get this project done </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> faster than usual.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, they were pouring
way more radiation material </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into this tank than was ever
allowed by regulations, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - And, you know, obviously
a chain reaction happened, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> something went wrong. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And this guy who was literally standing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right next to the tank,
right next to the tank </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> pouring in this radioactive material, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he got hit by the full blast of this chem- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - This chemical reaction
that was happening, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So, he was literally the
most radioactive person </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who has ever been documented
in history, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Damn.
- And it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a fucking horrific story of like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he actually survived it initially, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He survived it initially
and they went to hospital. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And he, on the first day, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he looked so well that
the nurses were like ready </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> to discharge him the next day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mm. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That is until they like
looked at his like DNA </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and his DNA had been obliterated like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jesus.
- Like fucking obliterated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I don't think like
anyone at that point realized </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the gravity, aside from
like the doctors, of course, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> realized the gravity of
just like what was in store </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for this guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because like he got to the point where, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because his cells could
not make new cells, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, he got to the point
where the doctors were trying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to save him because his family
and himself wanted, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to try everything they could. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I feel like it
would've been less painful </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just to let him pass away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Because like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he got to this point where his body </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just started deteriorating, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> his skin would fall off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> and would start bleeding and pussing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and he like, they could do
nothing, but just bandage him up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah.
- Because there was no way </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> for like for his body to make new cells. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he basically just
deteriorated to death </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Geez.
- You hear about the accounts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of this and it sounds like fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's probably the
worst way, worst way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That was like one of
the worst ways to die. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was thinking of a different story </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> of like the guy who was
like living in Hiroshima </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> during World War II. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then when the bomb dropped, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And he survived that one.
- Yeah, I know this one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And he escaped with his family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> out of Hiroshima to Nagasaki </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Oh.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And then the second bomb dropped. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And he survived that one as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Mm.
- I thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you were talking about that story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] I think- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He must have been pretty
radioactive after that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Apparently, I dunno if this is true, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I remember hearing that there's more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was not just him. There's
a few other people as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but they reckoned that maybe a hundred </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or so people had the same experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But they just dunno who they are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I mean, that is crazy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Really crazy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Just like thinking about this.
- Shivers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, there's a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember his name, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he talks about a lot of
these radiation stories </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and mistakes and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember his name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He does the science videos as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck, I can't remember his name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're really, really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And there's some other horrible
stories about like people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing experiments that went wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was that other
story, I think I know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which YouTuber you're talking about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did he make a- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The guy with the amazing hair? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Did he make that video on the
guy who like stuck his head </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the Hadron Collider? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. So, yeah, it was- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And he got like shot by plasma- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wasn't the Hadron Collider, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was I think a similarish thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, he got shot by an atom- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- In the head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it like penetrated his
brain and he survived it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But like, but yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And then there was some like mix up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where they thought he was alive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - He has like amazing hair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> He's got like a lions mane.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This guy's amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not the guy who got shot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The guy who makes the YouTube videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, okay 'cause I was about
to say like is this some- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kyle Hill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is this some new kind of like therapy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to give you like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing hair? Just get shot by an atom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Shot by an atom. (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you experiencing hair loss? Boom! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've definitely seen this thumbnail. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's called The Demon Core.
Have you seen this one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, yeah. I've seen that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was a good video.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was a horrible
story though as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> People fucking around with this thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it goes wrong and then like all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the scientists die.
- [Garnt] What's a demon core? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was just like nuclear active core. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's always nuclear. (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And it was, I can't
remember exactly what it was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Watch the video, it's really good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it was just telling about the story. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's really, really strange. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes you just think like, why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just leave it. Just don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - What happened with the
guy who got shot by an atom? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think he survived. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - He survived but then he unsurprisingly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> developed these like really
weird like brain traumas. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And like he, I think he had like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] He survived.
He definitely survived. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He survived for a while I believe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like he lost a lot of
his hair and then he, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he just had all these like
weird brain complications </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that the doctors were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno what the fuck to do with this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- He's currently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 79-years-old and living. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - 79 Years old and living? Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What a fucking badass
title, got shot by an atom. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, we know that 100%
of the time, as we know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when you put a head in an- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A Hadron Collider.
- You survive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We have a hundred percent survival rate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We know that, we know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I'll fucking stick my head </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in there like tomorrow, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Jump in the Hadron Collider real quick. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's been other cases as well, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> people will get the, what's
the thing that powers x-rays? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I think there's like, is it something? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There was one guy, I dunno
if it was an x-ray exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But it was a medical device. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah.
- And some people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> broke into an abandoned hospital
and like stole this thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And they just thought </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it was some kind of
like cool glowing thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Turns out that cool glowing thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like radioactive like
uranium or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, I can even be mixing
up two stories together here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was on his channel
as well, really weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And now they're the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think like the whole, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it might be a different story actually, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but like the whole
village, they were like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> everyone come check
out the glowing stones. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh no.
- No joke. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And people were all touching
it and playing with it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And like a whole like family
and a few other people died </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they were just touching
and playing with the stone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey muttering) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't ever touch glowing stones, kids. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - If it's glowing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's probably a bad sign
that a chemical reaction </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is happening there that you
shouldn't be holding, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Curse glow sticks, curse
glow sticks for making us think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that things that glow are so cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> God damn it. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_06> the zombie apocalypse? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Although maybe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bro, they got Uber Eats still going? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> If not, no, I'm done, I'm out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's the point? What's the point, dude? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is, but he's also a zombie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, eh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, do you want to
survive a zombie apocalypse? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It depends where you are, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like if you're in an
area that's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're the only one remaining, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like there's just zombies fucking clawing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at your apartment or whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then it's just like, just take me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - At that point, I'm just like, okay, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well, the world's fucked anyway. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- You know, whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I mean, (sighs) I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like a zombie apocalypse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> wouldn't be that hard to survive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what I'm like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> That's my biggest like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> unless it depends on the
type of zombie, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause if you're talking
about like the traditional, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really slow fucking
zombie, that fucking walks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like one mile an hour, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how did this become an
apocalypse in the first place? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> How are people this incompetent </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that this became an actual apocalypse? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - In all those movies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're just like, "No, don't come near." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> While they standing still, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "No." (moaning) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - If it's "28 Days Later," all right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> now I get how it could become a- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - If we're like talking like
CoD zombies, then it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah, I'm fucked. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I feel like, you know
how like some of the movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they make, they manage
to make like villages </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that are like really
tall walls and no one can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get in and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like that would be- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I've learned
anything from Dead Rising, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just stay at a mall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Hit them with a foam bed. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Combined with a chainsaw.
- Hit 'em with a bench. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Put the machine guns on the wheelchair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then drive the wheelchair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I feel like, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like if a zombie
apocalypse ever did happen, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the one place where,
you know, being in America </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would be a massive fucking advantage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you think about how
easy it is to gain access </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to weapons here in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Until the zombies learn about those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're like, "We can
use this too." (growls) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I thought you were gonna be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you can just go like North Dakota </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and there's no one there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Or that, true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Escape to Wyoming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, you're in Idaho? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Zombies actually don't want to go there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> They like go to the board, and like, err. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, mm. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Err. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean, that's the one place </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where if you have a gun, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it'll be like very, very useful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you're assuming
guns will stop zombies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Exactly.
- That is true. That is true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because like games
have led us to believe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that it's like, do you
want to kill a zombie? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Just get good at head shots. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Fuck, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Realistically, will it
actually kill a zombie? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How much ammo can you
really get a hold of? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, Resident Evil
got one thing right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It'd be fucking annoying
to be like conserving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your ammo with this shit.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Actually like I would be that guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I would be that guy, where you have- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Oh my God, shoot it!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt's like, "No, I'm sorry,
man, I got four bullet left." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wouldn't be like, a zombie
could be right in front of me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'd be like searching
for like an ax or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Be like, I don't need to shoot a zombie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't need to shoot a zombie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, maybe I'll need this ammo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like the boss
battle, whatever that is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Katana collection boys are
winning, that's for sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would do anything I could, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> even if I had a gun, to not use a gun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just in case, just in case. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I gotta go back to the safe
room to like buy more bullets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - In a zombie apocalypse,
probably honestly the best thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you could probably have is
just having a medieval set </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of armor and weapons. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Like a sword. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How the fuck they gonna bite you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- If you're wearing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a full like chain mail and
you've got a big-ass long sword. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] That's true.
- I think you're good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I think you're good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Those chats on YouTube, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the ones you're talking about,
the correct sword techniques. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're gonna be the real winners. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- 'Cause that's what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've always like struggled
to figure out, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the video game logic of, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just shoot 'em in the
head and it'll stop them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, but they're dead already. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why would they die like
a normal human being? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I don't know it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. It depends how the zombies function. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> If it's a parasite taking over the body. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we're talking about fake, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fake science now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> You know, could be any sort
of reason or any sort way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to kill a zombie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you just like, you know,
if you have a fucking Katana </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something and you just like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chop their body into bits, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then they can't do anything, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Even if they're still alive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You gonna chop someone's
body into bits, Joey? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know how long that's gonna take? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - How long is it gonna
take one zombie, Joey? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] You're gonna be knackered. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the zombie apocalypse, Joe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll take 'em out one
at a time, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey's gonna like sit
down and have a breather </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> when he's done like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like hold on, guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey thinks a katana
works like it does in anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where he just like does
like the fucking sword thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and like the zombie's in a hundred pieces. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Alight. You know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Guns guns are good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Probably a flamethrower's
pretty good, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Flamethrower, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is a flamethrower an actual good weapon </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or is it just like an aesthetic weapon? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a very good weapon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a waste of money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I mean, if you hit someone
with it, they die, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - But what- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know that, but I should- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah but wouldn't the
fuel for a flamethrower tank </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> be more scarce than bullets? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Surely there's more
effective weapons and like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it looks cool and it's effective, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but surely there's more efficient weapons, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I should say than the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Chainsaw. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like wildly inefficient. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But like if you hit
someone I think with it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I think they just, 'cause
like the ones that like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think like Elon Musk sells, for example. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah.
- That's basically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just like a hair spray with a lighter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think the original
ones in like World War II </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were like, they would actually
shoot out oil on fire. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- 'Cause you could see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the streams of liquid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> So, they would land and hit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And obviously if you get hit with that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that's just gonna like burn through. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, of course, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like what I'm trying
to say is you, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you have two guys, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one person has a flamethrower,
one person has a gun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think the person with
a gun is going to win </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kinda outta that battle, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. But you're not fighting,
you're fighting a zombie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's true. That's true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay. Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like your goal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is to make it so the zombie can't move. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What a weird topic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like your goal,
'cause you don't even know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if you can kill it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> What if the gun doesn't
work? What if it doesn't- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But what if the zombie
doesn't feel the heat? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But what if you burn off like his legs? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you could just chop
off his legs as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are you gonna chop off his legs? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I dunno. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you gonna be hacking away. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> How long is that gonna take? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey's just living like the anime dream </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like using his katana now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just want to Kirito okay? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I admit it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I just wanna come out
and just fucking do this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] If you just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just duel with the swords. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you just burned
off his arms and legs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he wouldn't be able to move.
- I just wanna be Guts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What about like a chainsaw then? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. That's pretty-
- I feel that'd be more- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Gods of Wars has
probably got that right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also, but I wonder, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I wonder if like
bones would like clog </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> a chainsaw or do anything? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Probably not 'cause I
think trees are stronger </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than bones, I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are they? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know. I don't know actually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - But we don't build
houses out of bones, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well that's because we don't
really farm bones, do we? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> We don't have a forest full
of bones that we can farm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and build houses out of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - That sounds like an aesthetic, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> build a house out of bones, dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That sounds fucking badass. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] It does. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like a Tim Burton movie waiting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what you can do,
right? In the zombie apocalypse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You collect the limbs and
you just take the bones out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just make a house out of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There you go. Problem solved. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Recycling in the zombie apocalypse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The one thing that
zombies can't penetrate, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a house full of bones. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because they'd be like, "Oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just one of us
with a few extra bones." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not gonna go near that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think in some countries as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not allowed to fill
up a gas canister as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's illegal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, you wouldn't be able
to get a stock pile of gas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it turns into a weapon? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ah, normally it is when
the government is concerned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that your population
might be making weapons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Molotov cocktails. Things like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That makes sense.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But will they care
during a zombie apocalypse? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is the question. (sniggers) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. True. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] They're not gonna be like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Step number one, you've
gotta get a container. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And number two, you're probably
not gonna be the first guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the gas station. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's be honest.
- [Joey] That's true, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's true.
- We've seen it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when gas prices, when we hear about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> gas shortages, everyone goes- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- It's already too late. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess that's the first
thing you should do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in any apocalypse, is
immediately go to the gas place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and get, I don't even have a
car, but I'm getting the gas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. I'm getting gas. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I know I'm gonna be
king when people want gas. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, well I can give you it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have four tanks in the back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] That's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like covered in
like fucking black smoot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing)
- Yeah, 'cause I was thinking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because like I feel like
part of the reason why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's so hard to get people
to take action over, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I dunno, like real life
apocalypses that could be happening </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right now is because real life apocalypses </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sound so fucking boring. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, oh, like, oh, the
temperature of the Earth's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> slowly changing by a
few degrees every year. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And we need to do the best to Earth. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like that sounds so boring
like compared to like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we are being invaded by hoard of zombies </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and only you can take them on with a- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Global warming is the
least sexy apocalypse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Let's be honest. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The Chad versus like
a virgin apocalypse. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone likes the zombie thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they think that
they're gonna become the Chad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who games the system, becomes this king. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's all in video games, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like when have you heard
of a fucking video game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you have to fight global warming? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe we need that.
- We need that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - We need that in real life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, let's be honest, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think in a zombie apocalypse, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you're gonna die from another person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not a zombie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The people who made Dead Rising </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just need to make like Heat Rising. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Right now.
- Something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You go to prison for 20
years if you kill someone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and people still do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> In a zombie apocalypse, there's
not gonna be any punishment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> People are gonna start killing everyone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] That's true. That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone's gonna be like, "Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that one guy pissed me off on the train. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna go find him." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel, yeah, I feel
during a zombie apocalypse, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone's just gonna be so on edge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you're probably gonna
get killed by another human </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> before you get killed by a zombie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's no way anyone
would admit to being bitten. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I thought everyone who
didn't admit to being bitten </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> in a zombie movie was the asshole. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But in reality, we've been
through a pandemic now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's just like most of the
human race at this point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Like if you got- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You also probably have to
kill other people as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Of course. Of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you wanna get their stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Of course. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just a Battle Royale now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - If Fortnite has taught me anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kill them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If that old grandma has a full supply </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of water and food, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Zoom was already man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Fortnite has trained
them just how to kill- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just border up the fucking
house in two minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The zombie apocalypse happens
and you just hear (knocking) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with like, ssh.
(both singing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, we're fucked,
we live in like Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the last person you ever go against </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a video game is like
16-year-old Asian kids. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause they're just insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, we'd be killed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're like challenger rank. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we're like trying to
figure out what's going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they've already built a fortress. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They've been perfectly
trained by Fortnite, Minecraft </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to build the perfect fortress. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Unironically, these
kids would've somewhat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of an understanding of basic
survival 'cause of Minecraft. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. More than us, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. You're actually right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> That's something to think about. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - They know how to
craft all the materials. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not good but it offers something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah.
- It offers something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They at least know that coal
can be turned into charcoal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- It's useful to know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause we're talking about
going back to useless skills, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like I think I feel like I should know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> more survival skills than I do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no, you shouldn't, you shouldn't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why? Why? I mean, I've seen you- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - God. You're like, please,
please, I need to survive. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've seen you try to start
a fire with a piece of flint. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> And that didn't go well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why I feel like I need to learn </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> more survival skills than I already do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Would you ever get a bunker? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Like a bunker in your house? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like a bomb bunker? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Like a shelter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That'd be cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, yeah, if you're
like traveling a bunch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for your work, it's useless. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's just cool, you know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wouldn't want a bunker for emergencies. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would just want a bunker
because it's just cool </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to have like a secret bunker. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Have you seen that guy on
YouTube who's building one? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Colin Furze. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Like a whole bunker underneath his house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Underneath his garden. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> There's actually one company in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that can build bunkers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How much is a bunker? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, it depends on the size, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's like $50,000 or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Can we build a bunker? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - If you have like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Trash Taste bunker. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Trash Taste bunker. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Trash Taste emergency bunker. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt, we need land for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - We don't have land, Garnt. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> None of us own land. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Buy the land first </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can do whatever
the fuck you want with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yet, yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I'm gonna do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I ever buy land in the future here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, fuck the house,
build a bunker first. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who needs a soundproof- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly, there's just
something about the idea </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> of building a bunker
that just like no matter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how old you are, it just fulfills
like this childhood dream. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a tree house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's kind of like the next
level tree house, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's kinda like exciting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like your kinda place. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. It's like a secret base, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, just imagine- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, what's the
difference between a basement </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and a bunker?
- Huh? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - A basement is just like
an underground like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I think a bunker is
supposed to be like secured. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. It's supposed to be secured. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - With like concrete or- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can survive there, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> a basement is just a roof. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's tons of basements in London. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like three story basements. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But they're not bunkers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But they're not bunkers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I thought like three levels deep, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which some of these basements are. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, when I think of a bunker- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - If you're three level deep. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> That's probably good, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe you can convert
that into a bunker. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But when I think bunker,
I don't just think a room, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, I think like a
sizeable amount of secret space </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's secure and you can be like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think like the only way
to get in is through a hatch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, like that's what
I think when I think bunker. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not like a welcome to
the bunker. (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Open the plywood door. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey imitating creaking door) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's not a bunker, you know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Move the ethnic looking beads </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> out of the way to get
into the room, the bunker. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Place the book in the bookshelf. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really want a basement.
I just wanna have a basement. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wanna bunker. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Then, no, you want a basement. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you ever have like a tree house </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> or anything like that as a kid growing up? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who the fuck had a tree house? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] No one had a tree house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A tree house was this
mythical thing that some kids </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> talked about, but I'd
never known a single person </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> who had a tree house.
- My friend had a tree house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] He had a tree house? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because there's always that one kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who has that one dad who's
like never tired after work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and actually wants to do shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And he actually gets shit done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it was the one dad
that worked from home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh. Oh, okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was the one dad
that worked from home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Checks out, checks out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also the construction dance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That was my task.
- Ah, they get shit done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> My friend, but it wasn't like a massive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like fucking Simpsons
tree house looking thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was literally like
enough to maybe fit like two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> five-year-olds in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like an adult would not
be able to fit in that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why a tree house? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've always wondered, why? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause it feels like a one with nature. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's just
kind of cool to be able </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to like sit comfortably- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Those poor trees- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - On a tree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We mock it by taking its own kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and fashioning it into a house
and putting it on top of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How cruel of us. How cruel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's kinda like building
a house outta bones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, a dog house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - A dog house made out of dog bones? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's actually kinda
true, that is. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When you put it like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's kinda fucked up, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can we Google are there
any houses made out of bones? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Can we fact check that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Tim Burton must have a
house made out bones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I refuse to believe- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - If anyone is gonna have
a house out of bones, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's Tim Burton. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna build a bunker now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I just wanna build a space. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- I do want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a basement, let's just start
off with a basement, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you, did you not have a basement? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I've never had, no,
I've never had a basement. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Sorry? Sorry? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Going back to another question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm ignoring your basement. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which one of us would
survive the longest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in a zombie or some kind of apocalypse, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you think? And why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. It's a good question. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel Garnt would trust
someone and be betrayed by them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel you would just be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll be the alpha male and
just go out immediately </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just get killed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's so right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> That's so true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're like, "Outta the way boys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I got this. Aah." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like you would come
up with like the perfect plan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of how to survive the zombie apocalypse- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then not follow the plan. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then you'd somehow
like overlook something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> at step one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Out of confidence or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like Joey wouldn't
realize the apocalypse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> is going on, except- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - The moment I would realize- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Oh, sorry, mate. I was
playing PhotoFantasy." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The moment when I realize
is when you're dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Guys, I turned up to the (indistinct)- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, where is everyone? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It must be the wrong day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was too busy meditating,
watching Pokemon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just escaped to my mind palace. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, I feel like we have
different varying degrees </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of survival instincts, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I don't feel any one
of our survival instincts </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is particularly strong either. (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I guess, we're all like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe we should do a survival special too. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel the best way to determine
how someone would survive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in a zombie apocalypse is
how they play Dead Rising. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I think- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, no it's not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it is not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You are talking outta your ass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because I feel like
people who are just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm just gonna fucking pick up something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and charge right into the crowd." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are the people who would not
survive a zombie apocalypse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like pick up what? A newspaper? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would anyone go into a newspaper? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, "I'm gonna pick up this
tennis ball, see much damage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it does to the zombies." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the kind of person who
would just be like, "Charge." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't think anyone's doing that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> but I dunno like everyone, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know what I'd do
in a zombie apocalypse. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, everyone would be like- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cry.
- Yeah, just cry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just cry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just camp and like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Break down and cry. (lips blowing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, you just try
to stay in the same place </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for as long as possible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think you'd have to find a
sidekick as soon as possible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - A sidekick? (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What, like Robin? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Listen, if you're gonna survive, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you need to become the main character, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how do you become the main character? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> By getting a sidekick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? You get a sidekick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - What are you gonna run around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in like the fucking
apocalypse town and be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Who wants to be my sidekick?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] You know, you- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you'd like to survive, come with me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're just walking around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, all right a
zombie is about to destroy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about to kill this 10-year-old kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- You save the kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, "All right, fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll look after you." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Now, you're their main character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. But then you have to take care </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of a fucking 10-year-old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean, that
obviously is the downside, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then if something happens- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can just chuck the
10-year-old. (chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You're like, "Sidekick, do your job." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - "You're bait." Innit? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause he's only 10 years old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, he doesn't need as
much food as a full adult. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, then you can make him go
and like lookout or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, so just bait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think like finding a
kid and then making him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like do all the tedious tasks
is probably a good idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But what- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It just sounds like
a parent at that point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, yeah, but. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But also you'd get some tangible benefit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But whereas in real life you don't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> he just fucks off and
then goes to move to Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and doesn't contact you for months. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Not a zombie apocalypse,
what if it was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you're in "Lost" or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're stranded on a desert island. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who would survive the longest? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - On a desert island? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. You're in "Lost." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You've seen "Lost," right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Probably me, because I'm
the most familiar with like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wildlife and just like dangerous shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's just the Ozzie advantage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would definitely- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, you kids, outta the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would definitely
eat something and die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I would get food poisoning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you would get food poisoning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's an illness. It's an illness. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not sick, lads. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I could still go out spear fishing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - The one time Connor
loves that food poisoning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and isn't honest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a poisoning, Garnt, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> hence why it's called food poisoning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You see the reason why I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you would have an easier time surviving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the zombie apocalypse is because
you almost get a tangible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> benefit from being an asshole,
being a piece of shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- But in a desert's island, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to actually work together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Because if you're the asshole, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> then you're the one that's
gonna be exiled, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you need as much
help as you can get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Joey's like a few steps ahead </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where you have like a fucking society now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Well, yeah, of course- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like "Lord of the
Flies." Like. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just don't wanna be exiled, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, I was thinking about
how to start a fucking fire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before I get exiled. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - To the other side of
the island with you! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - On a desert island, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause you can't steal people's
food or whatever, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You have to work together.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In the zombie apocalypse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you could just go steal someone's house, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> go and, you know, steal someone's house. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's true. That's true.
- Steal someone's house? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sorry. Go steal their
stuff from their house. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. That's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, but, yeah- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're very limited on an island, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. You gotta work together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't really hide on an island. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - One of you fishes, one
of you doesn't make a fire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And one makes a house full of bones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - This conversation's making
me like wanna just learn </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot more survival tips
and survival instincts </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I don't know now because-
- Just drink your own piss. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Have you done that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I do it all the time, just
to get ready. (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Just in case, you never know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just put it through
a Brita filter, innit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That will sort out the piss. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I watched the survival man thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> He was like, even if you're
on like a raft in the ocean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You should never drink your own piss. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- It's worse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Apparently you should
never drink your own pee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why?
- See, like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Apparently, even if
you're super dehydrated, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> apparently it makes it worse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But that's so conflicting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's either everything
I've seen about drinking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your own piss is either, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never drink your piss or
always drink your piss. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> No, I agree, I agree. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's never in between. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, it's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I actually had the same
thought where I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is so conflicting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> One minute, Bear Grylls is
absolutely like smashing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> his own piss down like it's a beverage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would recommend, 10 outta 10. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then there's another
time where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> absolutely do not drink
your own piss ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just wasn't expecting. (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, you think on like the scale </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> there should be like
a drink pissing scale. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There should be a middle ground </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> on whether we should be
drinking piss or not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a lot of
misinformation about pee drinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I think needs to be corrected. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would like to know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's never a video that I have seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where the guys like, you may
consider drinking your piss. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm always like you think
under certain circumstances, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe you should be able to drink piss. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's about filtering it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> You need to find a way to filter it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bear Grylls doesn't filter it, does he? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I distinctly remember
there's one time where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> pissed in a snake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - While it was alive? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not while it was alive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not while it was alive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Can you get this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Ashley mumbling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, yeah, I think it was a
dead snake that he'd killed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I think, can you Google this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And he turned it into like a water sack </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> by pissing in it.
- [Joey] Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - And I think, I don't know how, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This just sounds like a meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] This does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Can you check this out? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a parody
of a Bear Grylls video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] Urinating into snake skin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, and I think it filters
it or something, somehow? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Or makes it somewhat
edible or I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Was it Bear Grylls who like used condoms </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> as like a device to hold
water or I might just like- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I dunno. Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I dunno why that- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why would we have condoms? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, Bear Grylls who comes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> to a desert islands with condoms. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, have a seat, have a seat, Bear Grylls. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You brought Hard Mike's Lemonade </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and condoms to the desert island, huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah look, now what do we have
here? It's the condom tree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I dunno if I can just
pick a condom of this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This isn't a sign out a
happiness skit. I think- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno why I've heard that, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> condoms are very useful for
holding bodies of water in case </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you need to survive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know who said that to me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or if it's Bear Grylls or
not, but I'm just like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wasn't that just like
a YouTube challenge? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's gonna be real annoying
getting that lube out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of that condom, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why are we pissing in the snake again? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What was the purpose? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - To survive? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Ashley] He said to have
required the additional liquid </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as a last resort for whatever reason. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, basically survival instincts, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is what we're arguing here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not saying like you should drink </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your piss on a Sunday
morning. I'm saying like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - If only they had giant tortoise shell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) I
have one liter of... (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I was saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going on a desert island, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm hoping it's the one desert island </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that has the last remaining
like giant tortoise. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That question of like what do you bring </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to a desert island? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One giant tortoise, please. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - A family of giant
tortoises that I can breed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I can sustain myself forever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Have you guys seen
like, "Nathan For You," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like talk about piss drinking. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Have you guys ever seen "Nathan For You?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, is this the one where he like tries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> to fix their business or something? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> There's one where he tries
to fix their business. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I've heard this is really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I really wanna watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is a really good show.
So, it's kind of like, so it's, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno what the actor's name, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the character he plays is Nathan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he tries to fix these businesses. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With like the most like out-of-the-box, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dumb idea possible, right?
- Mm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like part of like
what makes the show funny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is him pitching these ideas, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to these failing businesses. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, it's kinda like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what Sasha Baron Cohen does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like he puts people in
ridiculous situations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and sees how they react, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I think (laughs) like
one of my favorite TV moments </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of all time was possibly
like the only time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I've seen him like break character </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or almost break character. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause he was talking to this guy, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this old guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he randomly, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't remember the exact
context of the conversation, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but he randomly brings up like
a jar of piss or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right? Just to try and shock the guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay.
- And the guy goes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh yeah. Like I drink jar
of pisses all the time." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you could tell like it
was like the most unscripted, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> amazing piece of moment
on TV I've ever seen, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where Nathan's like,
"What did you just say?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He's just like, "Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like sometimes like I have
like my grandchildren's piss </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just lying about,
sometimes I take a swig." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And (laughing) you need </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to watch this clip,
like 'cause in context, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's hilarious, outta
context, it's still hilarious. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's the only time this
like Nathan comes close </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to like breaking character
because he's hearing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> something so shocking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why is it that immediately in my head, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, drinking your own piss. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Ha ha, hilarious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Drinking your children's piss, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the fuck is wrong with you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like as if it's like worse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're just completing
the cycle of life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They came outta you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] You're going back in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're taking it back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so fucked up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's disgusting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh gross. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. So, you go to a desert island? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right? You're on the
plane that Wilson's on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mm.
- And what three items </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do you bring to that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think his
name was Wilson, was it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, but the ball's name was Wilson. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was on the plane.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Tom Hanks' character, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, that wasn't his name.
It was the ball's name. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt coughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you're talking about
Tom Hanks' character, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Who cares about him.
Wilson was the star. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, you can bring
three items to survive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> What do you bring? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Firestarter. (sniggers) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Come on, come on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- [Garnt] What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a waste of an item. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The waste of an item? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Learn there, learn there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - What if, okay- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - We're not counting
giant tortoise, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. You can't bring a giant tortoise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's it, that's finite, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That's gonna run out.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You should get something more- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just like flint or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Well, the flint's gonna
run out too eventually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You shouldn't rely on that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You shouldn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. Assuming we're going now, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Without prior knowledge that
we're gonna be crashing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, you're gonna be going, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like the "Big Brother" or some shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> You're gonna be sent
to this desert island. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - A tent. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] You can take a tent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would take a tent 'cause I'm
not fucking collecting bones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to make a house, fuck that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just collect leaves, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Just fashion your own tent. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would love to see
you try and build a house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> from leaves, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's tear these things down at the end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and what are the other two? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - A knife.
- Okay. I think that's valid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a nice book. Oh fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - A nice book!
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey's gonna die day one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> He's gonna actually cut his
tent and then rip the book </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> in half out of anger. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - And stab myself. (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What would you bring, Garnt?
- I would bring a knife. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Mm. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - A water filter. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Ooh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That can filter salt
water to fresh water. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Smart, smart.
- Mm. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Hold onto those lines. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you can do that with a leaf. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can do that with a leaf, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just piss in a snake. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just drink your piss. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - And my grandchild's
jar of piss, of course. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Just in case I run out, just in case. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the one big
thing you'd want to take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is probably a fishing net. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought that as well,
I was like fishing rod </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> or fishing net.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You'd probably want a
really nice-sized fishing net. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] True.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It'd probably make
your life a lot easier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mm, true, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Or maybe like a fishing spear. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel like a knife you can make, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> you could make like a cavemanesque one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like a sharp rock. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like you could do that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And that would do
everything you need to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe, but I feel like a knife </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> would make things a lot easier. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] I think an ax
would be better though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - But using the knife, you
can make more knives, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> How are you gonna start
by making the knife </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to begin with? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the first knife </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that's like gonna be the hardest to make, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> unless you're like that one guy on YouTube </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> who made like a knife out of cardboard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like that.
- A knife out of air. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Damascus leaf knife
or some shit like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, if you're with
that one Japanese dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the island, you'll be
like, "Can I have a knife?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, "Which one?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What have you got? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which genome of tree do you want? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll make it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Can I take a boat? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like a really nice yacht? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll just taking my 6
million dollar mansion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey, I'm pretty sure some of
these like rich billionaires </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> would do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why can't I do it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No one set the scale of items I can bring, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why can't I bring a boat? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, then I'll bring a
jet and get the fuck out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let's assume it's
like a Minecraft sandbox </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where there's no end to the ocean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just goes on forever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I would like the
boat just to be able to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll just bring a house then with... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll just bring a city. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How are you gonna
bring the house, Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> How are you gonna bring a house? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - On a boat? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, you cannot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> You cannot bring a house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll fucking, I'll fucking- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What if it's a houseboat? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll fucking float in up-style </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with a fucking bunch of balloons, Connor, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like you're just making up
rules as we go along here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> So, I'm just gonna make up rules as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's perfectly
reasonable that you can sail a boat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to a desert island. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't see why this is it not fair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, then you wouldn't
need anything else </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you could just fucking
go back to the mainland </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with the boat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one said you have
to stay there, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The implication was you had
to stay there and survive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> If I'm staying there and surviving. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - The entire "Magic
Mike" collection on DVD. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Never get bored. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - A DVD player. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And a monitor with a solar panel. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A laptop with a 3060 in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My entire gaming set. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - A super computer chip. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I'll be the only one
who has them apparently. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. What would I actually bring? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] What would you actually bring? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Probably a fishing net. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. You said that. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know. I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like I could make
a spear out of something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I also think that is a lot of work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'd rather just catch the fish easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I'm gonna die pretty soon
if I don't get this food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah, true.
- So, I got a fishing net. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey And Garnt] Mm-hm. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - A Toyota Prius would be (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very economical. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Take a sick beach shot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mm, what else? Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> What's like the perfect strat? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> What's the optimized strat? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> A net's pretty good, a knife is shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Don't bring a knife. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What a fucking waste. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like a knife enables you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to make more tools needed to survive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Faster, as well.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, fine. So, fishing net and a knife. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I think fishing net and a
knife is like the go-to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like 'cause you can make a knife, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like in order to craft a knife, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like that would
take a lot of effort. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> But a knife is so useful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that it can help you craft other tools- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Fast as well.
- Fast as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel like a wind up torch </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> would be super useful actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause like how, let's be honest here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not gonna fucking do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Indiana Jones shit- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - With the fire? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just not gonna work.
- Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How are you gonna make that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't have oil?
- Huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Those are like oil rags
soaked in like a ball. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How are you, you can't
make one of those normally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just sweat onto it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] I don't know
how you'd make that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How would you make one of those things? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's maybe like some
life hack where you use </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like tree sap or some shit, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe, but like do you
really wanna be fucking around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> harvesting tree sap when you could just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Well, you're
probably gonna be harvesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> other shit, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - But like what would you want to be doing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> in the nighttime anyway? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because everyone's stuck
on a desert island. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Actually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's gonna be pretty dangerous. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe you see something? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Maybe you wanna-
- Well, if I see something- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, also rope. Rope actually. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't wanna make my own rope. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, that's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like a good fucking rope. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like a really good rope. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I feel like rope is, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rope is obviously useful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you only have- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you know how to make rope? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Huh? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you know how to make a rope? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't. But do you
know how to make a fire? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can learn how to make a fire. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know how to make a knife? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I can make a knife. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Start bashing shit together. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, if you can
learn how to make a fire, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you can learn out to make rope, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] I feel that's different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Rope is so hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You've gotta make these
like individual strands. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> And then, I don't even
know how you do that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then you have to start wrapping that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> How do you? Do you know what makes a rope? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I swear to God- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's the base ingredient to a rope? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - A base ingredient. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is a rope? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I swear to God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I've seen like ropes on
like YouTube tutorials </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> being made by like massive leaves. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like tiny strands.
- Tiny strands that they like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Braid them together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you really gonna
want to like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> rely on that though? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like and then when it breaks,
like fuck sake. (muttering) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What if the rope you bring breaks? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - How would you break a rope, Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With a knife. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would you be doing that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you mean, how
do you break a rope? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> How does any rope break? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you use it a lot,
sometimes it breaks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You must be trying really
hard to break this rope. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - How much rope are we talking about? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like as much rope as you want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Give me a length. Like roughly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - An infinite amount of rope. (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're gonna have an
infinite amount of rope. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, then I'll bring an
infinite amount of knives. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can, what is more
than one knife gonna do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I will tie the rope on one side </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> of like the fucking city I'm leaving from. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I'll fucking... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll just like rope myself
back out, like what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt, you could barely
cycle across the (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> How are you gonna pull
yourself back via rope? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt sighs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I dunno. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like I would be
interested to do like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not a complete like a desert
island survival special. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - We should do this.
- We should do a survival- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where we take the items that we said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll take a rope, a
fishing net and a knife. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And you can take, what was it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, rope. No, not rope. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A knife. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] It was knife,
tent, and a nice book. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's right. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Knife, tent and a nice book. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I tell you what you should've gone for, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you should've gone with take nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause he's an idiot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] Water filter for salt water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you didn't mention the last one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I said Firestarter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] Firestarter?
- Firestarter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yes, yes. That's what I would take. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - What would you use to
start the fire though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> with the firestarter? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because usually firestarters work </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because you already have like
a preexisting light, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So, where are you gonna get that from? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's like firestarters kits available </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> that make it easier to start a fire. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right.
- Than, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> using the raw materials there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right.
- But getting that initial </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> spark is the hard part, right?
- Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, have you guys
ever made a fire before? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Once. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Once. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - When? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like ages ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did the fucking stick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I did the rope one.
- Stick one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I did the rope and the stick- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where'd you learn how to do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - When we had like those
like, not scout things, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - At like school camp thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like a camping thing.
- I did it, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never got taught
this in school at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I never had like a
fucking like a survival. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you had rope, Garnt, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you could make that fire a lot easier. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How much rope are we talking?
How thick is this rope? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would probably side with a
thicker rope though actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So, it wouldn't work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But you could also, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the good thing about
rope is that you could, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's say if you had a really long rope, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> just cut of piece and
then start peeling off </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the individual strands
that make the thick rope. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then you got a small rope. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Now, Shaq, he did this.
- He did this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is just three idiots talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about surviving on a des- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Three idiots with zero survival knowledge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> talk about surviving on a desert island. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Now, I just wanna do a video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> where we should just try do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Would you move into a house you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> someone died in? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, if it's a fucking steal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, okay, hold on. It depends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> How did they die? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because if they died
from like natural causes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, sure.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But if it's like a
brutal murder, then no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay. Well, why though? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Why?
- It is literally all bone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That looks like a dark souls dungeon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] That (laughs) is literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> where the final boss lays. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's fucking horrific. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] That's the end
game in Elden Ring, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't imagine the skulls
being a part of the equation. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought it was just like
bones, tibias and shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like so, you would
happily move into a house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where someone got murdered? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh God, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I'm getting a deal on this. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll be at the fucking meeting with them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being like, "Oh, I dunno,
10% off is a little. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Ooh, someone did die? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe 15, 20% off?" (inhaling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - How low would you be willing to go? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like how much would you negotiate down </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you knew someone
had died in this house? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'd try at least get a third off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause like that's
actually a pretty big thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in Japan, isn't it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Not people getting brutally murdered, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like houses where people
have died of natural causes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Listen, Garnt, in this
market, you can't be picky. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You gotta take what you
can get if it's a steal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] That is true.
That is true. That is true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll be like, "Who died in here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, yeah? Great. Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm moving in now, is that all right?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - There's a website actually.
- [Connor] I know, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Which is like a real estate website </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> where it tells you which
houses are on sale of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they call it jiko bukken or
like accident apartments, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where some horrible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> accident has happened
and now it's on sale. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why would that affect
your view of the apartment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or the house though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like saying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, if someone had used
that swing and died on it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would you not want to use it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, probably not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it because they lived there? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that what like adds the weight to it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To me, I don't quite- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - To me, like a house is
just personal, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like your personal space. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's not a house. It's a home. (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's true. That's true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - To me, it's like, what
makes a home is the, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> the way that you've made it yours, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like the base walls and
floors don't mean shit to me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> but all my stuff, that's my couch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's my TV and I put it there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what makes it me,
well, to me at least. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, when you know, that's why
when I move into an apartment, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Oh, it's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Someone used to live here." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Oh, it's a box." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think that of like,
someone used to live here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like, there's a big
difference between, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone lived here for 30 years and, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that guy was dead there
a couple years ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like brutally, I'm not okay with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I know, it's- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But if it's not there anymore, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not like you moving in and it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't mind the dead guy,
he's been there for a while. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Step over him real quick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - (cross-talking) insurance
should get rid of it. Oh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> having your, what was it like? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I guess, it goes back into
partly into like superstition. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's a how, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not religious, I'm not
very spiritual or anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So, I don't have any sort
of connection with death </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and people or anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I just think it's a steal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just think it's a building. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's free real estate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally. Literally, right? Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Free real estate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Literally free real estate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Originally, like sometimes
when houses were really cheap </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in Japan here, I would
go and look, so I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's no way this is this cheap. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then you'd go online you would see, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> occasionally, that actually
someone had passed in there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if there's so many apartments where like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> eventually everyone has
to die in an apartment. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Or somewhere.
- Or somewhere, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or somewhere, yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's also like, that's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what if something like a battle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something happened on a piece of land, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> does that affect if you
built something on it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Uh.
- What about it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Is it 'cause it's just a personal feeling </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like it's 'cause it's a house? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm trying to get like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because like in Ikebukuro, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Sunshine City. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> That was built on like
a POW camp originally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it actually?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's why they called it Sunshine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because they were like let's rebrand it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to make it more happy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, they weren't gonna
call it... (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Prisoner of War prison.
- Prisoner of War City. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> POW City. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like I think
it was like one of the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why they renamed
it to be like Sunshine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they wanted it to be more positive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you, I believe, can you check this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Holy shit, I did not know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I believe, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I believe that it was a
prisoner of war camp before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so you'd think like, I don't go there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, "Oh fuck, man. Oh, Jesus." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think for me it's more
so about like the recency </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of the event, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like 'cause-
- That's fair enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, it's a mixture between
recency plus intimacy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Recency and intimacy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you know, I'm sure
there's a ton of land </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all around us that was, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where probably soldiers and, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people just died, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's like, that
happened a very, very, very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> long time ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Whereas if someone, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just last year got brutally
murdered in this living room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then, yeah, I'd be a
little more uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just not a nice thought </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> knowing that, I guess,
such an atrocious thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> happened in the very spot that you're- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are we talking about
just murder, by the way? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Well, just if someone
died from natural causes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm okay with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My concern would be with
murder or something, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, all right, what
if the guy got murdered? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was involved in like gangs
or something, dealing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want, on their address book, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for it to be like the guy
that we hate lives here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they come to my- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Knock knock. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I would probably be
asking a bit more questions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause obviously I'm not gonna, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if it's something like that
or the person was doing stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that, I'd be like, all right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this address is probably not
a great address in general. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> But I mean like I'd be
okay finding staying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there for like temporary or, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like, you know, you
stay there and, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you find out it happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like that's an interesting story, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but like there's just
something about settling down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or just calling somewhere a home </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where something like that has happened </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that would just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it doesn't make me superstitious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just not a nice thought to have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where somewhere for a place where you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> should be completely comfortable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I guess from my permanent home, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I might be a bit different towards it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- But towards renting, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't, I couldn't care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah.
- Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - If it's renting and I'm- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wouldn't even be okay
with renting, to be honest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even if it's a steal?
- Even if it's a st- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> But there's like there's other ways </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to get a steal, you know.
- Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's just like barter down. (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did, I'd kill for these
prices, literally. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I guess, different
question, but when does- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You move into a new place? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - When does it start
actually feel like your home </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and not just a place of residence? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> If you've ever felt like that, Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The moment you've like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hit the wall and you've
chipped it and you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh fuck, fucking hell,
that's my problem. Oh fuck!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - What? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's when it hits you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's literally- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did that day one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally day one. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You are just being irresponsible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I did that day
one 'cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not used to a wall being here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I chipped a good chunk of like the wood </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in the frame of something
when I was moving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> one of my chairs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I was like, "Oh fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not gonna get some my
deposit back now. God dammit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's literally day
one where your furniture </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is just a little bit more heavy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than you think it's going to be, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> your sofa, you just wanna
move the sofa a little bit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's just like, you're
just trying to nudge it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then it just, (makes ripping noise) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it just makes that fucking scratch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that scratch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you never see it coming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, I'm going to try my best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to not make this scratch, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's always like just a little late. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like it just slips a little
bit more than you think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's going to do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think-
- And just leave that scratch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think for me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the moment where I know I've
like really settled down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is when I am a hundred percent aware </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of where everything is in the house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because you have that
period where, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're first moving in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're putting shit away in like cabinets </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and, you know, everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then for a while you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fuck, where was that thing again? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> And you just like look
all around the house </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because you dunno where it is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But the moment where you're
like, (thumb clicking) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I know exactly where that
really specific thing is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel that's when it's like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you know what it is for me? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's really weird for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> For me, it's when I can
switch on and off the lights </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> without having to look at
them or try to find them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you move into a new
house and you just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where's the fucking light switch? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where's the fucking light switch? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And then you live there
for like a week or two </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then you can like
fucking ultra-instinct </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this thing, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like what- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, when you enter a room, you just... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? Especially like
if it's the living room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and like there's different
switches depending on which part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the living room and like you live there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for long enough, and like, to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a home is when I want to
turn on that exact light. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I know the exact switch
that I have to flick to turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on that exact light.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so weird for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I've never been a guy who's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> decorated his house a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's weird, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My room's always been like really bare. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like a proper engineering room, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is, I buy everything
exactly what I need to get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whatever I need done, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I need a desk, I need a
computer, I need a chair. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - So basically, you don't
buy nonfunctional things? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't until I moved to Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I realized how weird it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I was like, I feel like
Mark Zuckerberg, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I was like, I need to
add personality to this room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I need to buy stuff to like
fill this room up, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've always been that person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where even when I was back at home </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm like if I see
an empty piece on my wall, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, I can fill
that up to something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Ah, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Whether that's a poster
or a calendar or anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that I can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't decorate my walls until JoJo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, if you go look at my first videos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For JoJo, so, my walls are like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like a scientific experiment room. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like depressing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And JoJo changed them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I guess it's because like, I
guess before moving to Japan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the reason I never decorated anywhere </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was because I'd always
think about the moment </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where I would have to
move out of that place. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that, the thought of
having to like pack things up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just take everything down, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that seemed like such a... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Such a hassle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to remove
the hassle from myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> even though that's like years away </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> from when I need to move out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right, right.
- And then I just never </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ended up decorating my room. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then I remember like the only reason </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I started decorating it was
because I was on camera more so, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) so it would
look weird if there was nothing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> in the background and that
was literally the only reason. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I guess if you're not on camera, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then there's no need, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, that makes sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - But, but I guess, I'm
wondering what it would be like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you actually have
your own personal home </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you're gonna, I guess,
your permanent residence, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you know you're
gonna stay in for like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I guess, years and years, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm putting a big
fucking hole in the wall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> because I finally can. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I can't in my current place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, I wonder what the feeling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is of being like a true homeowner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- And just like being </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> able to do- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just wanna get to that point </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> where I'm like, you know
what? I don't need this wall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Entire wall, take it down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Just do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's just like, I look at that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like, that is the end game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the end game.
- That is the end game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - If I can do that, where I'm like, wait, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't need permission
to take down this wall, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I just do it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like, right on, like in university </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you fucking needed permission
to fucking put posters up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And like the type of blue
tack you use, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like go from that to
like breaking down a wall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is just like so alien to me.
- It's like, you know what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I want another room. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Give me another room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what I want. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Gimme another room. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Well, let's just make these two rooms </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> into one massive room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like that just sounds so cool to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I want a bunker, that's what I want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the end game for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want a church of made out of bones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] In my backyard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, luckily for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's just one ready for purchase. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Does the price get dropped for that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a lot of deaths on that wall. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel-
- A house made out of bones? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel like at that point, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just like an
aesthetic choice, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, you kill one person
in a house, suddenly, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You kill 50 people, oh,
now it's an attraction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Now it's cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, I see how it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So, what I'm hearing is,
you shouldn't stop at one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You should go the full... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Fully commit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Profitable to be a serial killer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Well, it is. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Here's the idea, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You're done, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You wanna make money,
you wanna be comfortable. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> First of all, step one,
become a serial killer. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Step two, profit because
you go to prison, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You never have to pay
for a thing ever again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No taxes, nothing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then now Netflix ringing you up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "We wanna make a true crime doccie." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Ah, ooh, six figures at per episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're just living like Biscuit Oliva. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, you would be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You'd be the king of the prison. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, I don't have to pay rent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you want from the prison store? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, you want four packs of ramen? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll get it for you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Clean my bum.
- You'd just be in prison. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Maybe you're into that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's the slight
downside to that, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Slight downside. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like a bunker,
isn't it? (chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you'll be rich. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In ramen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you ever wanna take on a DIY project? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. I'd love to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd love to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's one of those things
that I definitely, definitely, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> definitely, when I work less in future- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Mm-hm, yeah.
- And I get my own place, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is that I'm gonna have a lot of fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're like half retired. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Definitely have a lot fun doing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You get the mate over and you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Do you think this is a good idea?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's like, "Let's
give it a go, Connor." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's the one thing
you want to build or like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shed for sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shed?
- Just number one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You wanna build a shed?
- I wanna build a shed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I thought about building a shed </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> at my current place. (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Just 'cause I have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a lot of space, but
like, yeah, build. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Shed, I don't know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> What is it about building
a shed that it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, I'm a man? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the tutorial
level into like building shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or like a table? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I think that's the tutorial level. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's the tutorial level. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like a work table.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Building a work table
where you can do other DIYs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Building a shed is just
like the easy version </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> of building a bunker, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like not a tree house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't have to worry about gravity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not underground. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just in your garden, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just sitting there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just sitting there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean like
right now it's annoying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause like I'll have a problem, I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> man, if I just had a saw and some wood, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I could like make this
thing in my apartment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just work easier.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Would you ever want a man cave? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess that's the shed, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. For sure.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is it about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I dunno, but like there's
just something primal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about just having your
own like man cave, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I dunno why, but every guy I know- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - No ladies allowed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just a shed with like
a Time Crisis machine in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, "Boys, come over." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like pool table, dartboard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Time Crisis machine.
- Time Crisis machine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's all I need. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Has to be Time Crisis,
one or two, maybe three. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Anything- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't wanna be that guy who
assumes things about genders </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and stuff like that, but like
do girls want a girl cave? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I'm genuinely curious
because every girl- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - A girl cave. (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt, the house is the girl cave. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing)
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> That's why we build a man cave </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> because the girl doesn't
let you build the man cave </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in the house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - As men, we can't comprehend
more than one room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're like one room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't need more than one room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're like, I wanna be able
to play Osu! on 4k Dolby Atmos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in the shed and have a beer machine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what I want. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't care about how it looks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> It's my thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas I think, generally,
you know, I'm not assuming, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> that normal, I think,
women like taking care </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of the whole space, don't they? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - We're messy.
- [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if I'm correct, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I might've just said something
that's (cross-talking) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if I did- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also again, like in my opinion, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like just because I'm
this, men just in general, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just don't have a sense of interior design </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a lot of ladies do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then you meet some guys who do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You meet some guys who
are just like wizards </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like how- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you're saying generally.
- Generally speaking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the general consensus
is that a lot of guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are just like, put up poster here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And then put up something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that doesn't completely match over here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Whereas, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of ladies like,
no, balance, theming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was probably one of the things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hated most about moving, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was having to figure out
where everything goes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because every time you
try to do it yourself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just like, no-
- I just did my office. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I was like, I dunno
what to do for the rest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I just did my
office as well. (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just did my office as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And even my office was like
fucking difficult as shit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> to figure out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought I had like the perfect setup </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I put everything in place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then it just looked shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) It looked
shit. It looked shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I had to like do real life Sims </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where I was like placing
things in different spaces. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Moving it around.
- But unfortunately, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I couldn't just click on a button, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I had to like physically move
this fucking heavy-ass desk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like around my room until I found a place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that I felt comfortable with. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I wish I could just
like see in my mind's eye </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where would look the best. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But like my imagination
just sucks when it comes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> to interior design. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wish I had that like
overview camera, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> of the room where I could
just see the entire thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, yes, I know exactly
what this is gonna look like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Also, like I just hate making decisions. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't like, I dunno if that's the thing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like the thing- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Decision fatigue. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is why you would fail
in the zombie apocalypse. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Probably, I just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which weapon? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just want someone to
make all my decisions for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know? Like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Goo, goo, ga, ga, Garnt. (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Change my diapers, Sydney. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just want to exist comfortably. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I want someone to
make the decisions for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> As long as I can just exist comfortably. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's a good life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's a good place for
that, I think it's called jail. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Prison. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Honestly, you're bashing prison, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it kinda sounds like you like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they make all the
decisions for you there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - They tell you when to eat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They tell you when you
can go and exercise. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Look, Garnt, they kinda
sound like you might like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - But it's not- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think you would do the best in prison </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> out of the three of us.
- Why? (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause you'd be in the fucking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do you do well in prison? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You'd be sitting in the fucking corner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having a great time watching
like "Kitchen Nightmares" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in your head for the
third time, obviously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Me and Joey would be like going crazy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> true actually.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Garnt would be totally chill in prison. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You'd be friends with everyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause no one can hate you.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You'd have no decision fatigue either </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause everything's been selected for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't have to worry
about interior design. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally, the most
stress-free lifestyle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Consider, consider? (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's the knowledge that if
I wanted to, I could leave. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> If I wanted to, I could make a decision </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and have my own freedom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] I see, I see. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, maybe like a make-believe prison. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, Garnt wants prison, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but he can leave when he wants. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, like a rehab? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like a hospital? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like a hospital. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a mental asylum? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - If you're well enough, you can leave. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you can't leave
a mental asylum, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd be the easiest like
grandparent to take care of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, I would just like just leave- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Old folks home.
- Yeah. An old folks home. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Just leave me there.
- Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Future child, please do not
take this clip out of context. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Please take care of me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is just young me
talking shit with the boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Please do not leave me
in an old folks home. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can just imagine you go
to visit your grandparents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in this old person's home. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then just like next to
your 70-year-old granddad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is 30-year-old Garnt, playing Solitaire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like (chuckles) Garnt's
like, "I love it here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's amazing. They take care of me." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you ever thought
about it? Because, so like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - No.
- Have you ever thought about- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No never thought. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So, you have kids, right?
- Mm. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm sure every parent
goes through this phase. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You have kids. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You want them to take care
of you when you're older </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> because I don't know like many people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who want to be in a
retirement home, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You want to be close to
your kids as possible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How'd you trick them
into doing that? (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How would you convince
your kids to do that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, this is where the past 40 years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> will matter, Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Whether or not you
treated your kids right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did you raise a piece of shit? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's all about
how you raised them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - How were you raised? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Were you raised- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wasn't. I was left to
fend for myself, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> On a desert island. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - The wolves were my parents. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because for me, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Connor howling) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> For you, guys, you've got family, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You got brothers and sisters. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You can spread the load, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> For me, I'm like an only child. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, like my parents are
like all or nothing for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like praying that I
don't just wake up one day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, "Mom, dad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess you're going in
the retirement home today." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God, they're probably sweating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching this right now
actually. (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh shit, he's considering. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Depends, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause what if it's like different, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you are like 40, 50. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Mm.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You probably have a lot
more like time and resources </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to be able to help. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> If you're 20, 25, 30.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, you're barely being able </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to take care of yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also think about like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you live near your parents. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you could be, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you could be on the
other side of the planet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, if they can't
take care of themselves, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then who's going to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Retirement home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're, unfortunately, we are three guys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> who are living like very, very
far away from our parents. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly.
- But like, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I think like we're like the exceptions. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why my sister
lives near my parents. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, all the work goes to her. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do your parents need help already? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Having siblings is a cheat code, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all I'm saying, man. Like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, "Sister, good
luck. See you later." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Teleport away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You were the first one
to leave the house like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, now my sister's like,
"Oh fuck, I can't leave now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Totally raising another
kid wasn't so annoying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We'd all have like 15 kids. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> All right, well, Garnt, I'm
glad to know that your parents </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are on a one way street
to a retirement home. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>

episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] What's a survivalist?
I don't even know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] I think it was like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] It was survival episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This was a survival
episode for fucking idiots. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Drink piss.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is one of our best
ones I think in a while. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Drink piss or not? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Never drink piss or always drink piss. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the real question, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you drink piss to survive or not? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> That's the only piece of
knowledge I need to know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I'm missing right now. </SPEAKER_06>
