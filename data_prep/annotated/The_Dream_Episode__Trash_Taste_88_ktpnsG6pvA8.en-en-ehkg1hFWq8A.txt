<SPEAKER_03> - Hello, hello, hello, hello? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Testing. Testing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Testing.
- How do we podcast? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing)
- How do I talk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> to real human beings? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (digital chirping)
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do we just start?
- What was that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do we just start? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What was that?
- What do we do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What do we do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (gentle music) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Hello, gamers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and welcome to the next
episode of, "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Fucking I stuttered already.
- What is this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> midnight radio? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hello there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't want, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't even want to pretend
I have energy right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing)
I'm coming in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> with a chill class today.
- You don't have any energy? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. It's- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're the host, Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You should come up with host energy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hello, everyone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and welcome to this
episode of, "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I am your host for today, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> There, there, there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Was that enough energy, Connor? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Was that enough energy?
- Who are we? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Who are we? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know who we are.
- Who are we? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I am Garnt, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and once again, I'm joined
by my host, Connor and Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, wow.
- How have you boys been? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We've been all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How have you been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing)
is more the question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How've you been, Garnt? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've not been all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, I mean,
(co-hosts laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've certainly been in isolation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> If you didn't know, this
is actually the first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've filmed in three weeks now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we took two weeks off.
- Yeah, three weeks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know about you boys, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but not filming for three weeks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> felt like three years for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Especially for me
because I go on Twitter, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I go on social media, I
see you guys streaming, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> doing all of your shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and here I am just being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Just some bed ill. Just,
can't really talk, can't-" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I don't think
anyone can fault you for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, you got fucking COVID, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of course you're going to be sick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So if you didn't know, I, unfortunately, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tested positive about two weeks ago now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> It's been, actually, 15 days
since I tested positive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Now I have officially tested negative, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> so I am safe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to film again with the boys.
- He's back. He's back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Welcome back. Welcome back.
- Just in case. Just in case, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm in my own
(laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> isolation corner right here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - We didn't plan this.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been in isolation for 14 days and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How does it feel? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How does it feel to get COVID? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It sucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Luckily- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It feels American.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just joking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Fuck.
- Wow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> We're British, too.
- It's been zero days. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (everyone laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had to. I had to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's been three weeks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Three weeks and Connor's already, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How many minutes has that been? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was-
- I was just. I was just. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Connor was having withdrawal symptoms </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for three weeks.
- You know, the vein busting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Been like, "I want a show so hard." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - My veins were bursting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I hadn't insulted America in three weeks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember when I got it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was, honestly, a little bit salty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was a little bit salty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not because, Obviously,
getting COVID sucks, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I was a little bit salty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> because before I got COVID, I
hardly ever went out at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I didn't go out because
I spent all this time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> marathoning all the great anime of 2021 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to make my, "Best of Anime, 2021" video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I was just inside. Just
watching all the best shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Watching all this anime. Didn't go out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I went out, Aside from,
"Trash Taste" recordings, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I went out once, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and the only time I went
out was with these boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That was, literally,
the only time I went out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in the past two weeks
prior to me catching COVID. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I figured it out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] You think you figured it out? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know why you got it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I think the air, when you're six foot, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is high enough.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - COVID was traveling
in the six-foot sphere. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> We're under the, sorry, Joe, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Under the six foot.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> We couldn't breath it in.
We couldn't breath it in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hot air rises, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> COVID rises.
- COVID rises. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - COVID is rising. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was about to say
anime gives you COVID. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess that's another hypothesis as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the actual scientific, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> We're not scientists. Do not take of that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - COVID is the height equalizer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We needed this. We needed this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We need a win.
- They need to nerf six foot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or something now, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Obviously, when I tested positive, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember messaging these boys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, like, "Boy's, I got to be honest. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You should probably be careful </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because, I'm not going to lie, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the only time I've been
out in the past two weeks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> aside from, "Trash Taste",
which I'm also with the boys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was with you guys when we off
to that one business meeting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let me just say I'm glad I got that text </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> while I was on the toilet
because I did shit myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> When I read that, I
was like, "Oh, my God." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Would you have shit yourself
if you weren't on the toilet? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Probably. Yeah.
- Oh, okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was like, "Thank God my pants are down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm literally taking a shit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I was like, "Brace
yourself, boys. It might come. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It might come." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The storm's coming.
- Yeah. The storm's coming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it didn't come. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And, apparently, I was
the only one who got COVID </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in our entire office. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I say this because, I say this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm happy that no one else got COVID </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- aside from me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm happy. I'm happy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why didn't anyone else get it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want to be the only one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But as the guy who does not, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> The only time we go out to make content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is for, "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You boys, filming outside, going outside, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> filming constantly, I'm just
like, " Why, why, why me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is it me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is it the nerd that stays
inside and watches anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that gets COVID? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anime gives you COVID,
man. I'm telling you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why do you think I stopped watching it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because Sydney got it
as well, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Sydney got it around two days
after me, which makes sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That was two days after
symptoms had set in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Obviously, I'm glad that I was vaccinated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I think it was Omicron as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because my symptoms weren't too bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember I felt something coming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know when you wake up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have a bit of a sore throat, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you start shitting yourself? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because you're just like,
"Oh, is this illness?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Is this it?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Am I getting ill? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Am I getting ill? Am I getting paranoid?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember on the Thursday night, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I've been paranoid before about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Am I ill?" Or "Am I not ill?", </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I have a slight sore throat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or a slight cough or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I remember Thursday night here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and your body knows when
it's about to get ill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could feel that my body, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> That a storm was coming in my body. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was praying to God
that it was just the flu </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or some kind of normal, other illness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I knew that something
was coming and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I told Sydney, "Sydney, I
think I'm about to get ill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm calling it now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm calling it now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] See if you get ill. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm going to get ill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - "You can't be mad if I
get ill. I already said it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, "Honey, don't be mad.
Promise you won't be mad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Promise you won't be mad. I
think I'm about to get it'll." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't have a fever but
my body started to feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a little bit groggy,
a little bit fatigued. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like,
"I've felt this before." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've felt this before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I've gotten the flu or
that kind of illness </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it conks me out for a few days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm like, "Honey, don't be alarmed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think I might be ill." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I went to sleep, woke up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and had a pretty high fever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For me, at least. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember when we did
our second vaccination, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had a fever of 38 degrees Celsius. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what that is in Fahrenheit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> On that Thursday,
- 12. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - On that Thursday,
- It's 12. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - On that Thursday, I started
off with a 38 degree fever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I was like, "Okay, I
definitely got a fever.", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> went to get tested, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then, by the time
nighttime came around, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that fever had gone up 40 degrees. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck it. Which is dangerous.
- Uh oh. Uh oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is dangerous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was Googling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I was Googling, "When should
I go to the hospital?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Spoiler, he lived.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is the, What is the
boiling point for human? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because normally when I
get the flu or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I go up to 39, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, Even then, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's pretty high-
- That's a really bad cold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> as well.
- That's a really bad cold. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I was like, It was like,
I remember measuring myself, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> getting to 40, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then I remember Googling, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "How high does your fever need to be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to consider going to the hospital?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember Googling it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and said, "After around 41 degree, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you should consider
going to the hospital." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And me, already drenched in sweat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I start sweating even more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What do they, What can they
do there, if you have a fever? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, "Oh, here's a bed. Lie down." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What can they actually do?
- Is it like placebo, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> where because you're in a hospital, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you're going to get better sooner? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe they're like, "Oh, here's
an IV with nothing in it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or maybe they give
you more stronger meds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Maybe they give
you more stronger meds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But at least-
- Here's POCARI Sweat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Shut the fuck up.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is hospital POCARI Sweat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - But also, with some of these things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, go ahead. Go ahead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll go on a rant after this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, all I was going to say is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I feel like it
is a bit of a placebo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also, in case your
symptoms do get majorly worse, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there is someone there to
put you under intensive care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just in case. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm absolutely terrified of hospitals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the only thing I'm scared of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Oh, same here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't really-
- Well, I don't know anyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who goes to the hospital and goes, "Yay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - But some people don't mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're like, "Oh, whatever." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> But I'm like, I would
literally do anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not to go to the hospital,
which probably means that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> at some point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm probably going to
come down with something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and I should probably go
and get it checked out, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - And just die in bed.
- But I'm not going to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> But I'm not because I'm so
stupid that I'd be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> "No. I'd rather not" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because when I get ill, I
just never, ever assume, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I should go to the hospital." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just think, "Oh, I
should just ride it out." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But then you hear stories
about how people die from that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, "Aah." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I feel like a
lot of this is part of, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I think a lot of this is part of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> growing up in England as
well because, I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's definitely a
difference in mentality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> when it comes to illness, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> especially when I started dating Sydney </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and seeing how she handled getting ill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> versus how I handled getting ill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I'm just like, If I
have a fever, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Jut take some paracetamol,
ride it out, whatever." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just start sweating in bed.
- Sweat it out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Sweat it out, sweat it out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Because, in England, if
you go to see the doctor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by the time you book an appointment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and you get the chance to go see the GP, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the fever's already gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The fever's already gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're either better or dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's either you're bad
enough to go to the hospital </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> or you just don't go to the doctor at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But with Sydney, luckily,
Sydney had health insurance </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> when she was in, When she
was growing up in America- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Stop bragging.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sure. Sydney's privileged, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah?
- Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> She had health insurance.
- Wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. Wow, health insurance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So she would be like, If
she just got slightly ill, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Just go see the doctor.
Just to make sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just in case." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Use that health
insurance to your advantage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Use that health insurance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because you can just go see a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So why would you not go see a doctor? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Me, dying in bed, being
like, "No, I don't see, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sydney, I don't need to see a doctor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't need to see a doctor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why would I need to see doctor? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's only a 40 degree fever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Google says I need to be 41
to go see a doctor, Sydney. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on. Come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I aint a pussy boy. I aint a pussy boy." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's true though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> In Japan, people are like
that, that's why, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> From what I heard,
(indistinct) people are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I've got a headache.
I'm going to the clinic." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> What? What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no, no. You'll be fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. Just sleep it off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. Maybe I'm being too harsh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then, do you ever find
that sometimes you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if this is me thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> but sometimes I'm getting sick,
I'm like, "No. Stop, body. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Stop. Stop, right now."
(laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? Did you develop Nen?
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I might have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if this
is just me being stupid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but I just completely ignore it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When I'm about to get sick,
I'm like, "We are not sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We will continue with our day
like everything is normal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That just sounds like copium to the max. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sometimes I feel like it works, though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if it's
just pure luck or it's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's probably my own stupidity. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes I get ill, I
feel the illness coming, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then, in my mind, I feel
like this is a deciding point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In my he'd I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Am I going to resign
myself to being ill?, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> or am I going to be
like, "No, I'm not ill. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm going to continue on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm going to eat healthy,
I'm going to do it." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This sound like some Joe Rogan-esque shit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm saying right now.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> For small illnesses. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Obviously, if you've got some
kind of horrible illness, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, "Yeah, no- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The flu is controlled by the government. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No amount of mind power is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> "Well, you know, it's
like a placebo effect." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> This shit is completely nonsense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We are not medical professionals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're going to say this right now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we are not medical professionals. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is a joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not a joke. See? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sorry.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I inject horse urine into my veins, Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When it's a tiny illness,
when it's a sore throat, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something like that,
sometimes I feel like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how much of your mental,
Mental willpower can affect it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because you hear about the placebo effect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> affecting how you can perform
in certain situations. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm wondering, how much can that affect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> your likeliness to get sick? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I do feel like you're, Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> This is going to be complete
speculation bullshit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is all anecdotal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Any medical professional would
be laughing at us right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is completely anecdotal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I do feel like your mentality </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and your willingness to, I
don't know, accept something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like it does play some
kind of conscious affect. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Because you hear, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You hear about stories </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about people who have a deadly illness </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and because they have
the will to fight it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some people are able to
fight through the illness, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and some people are more
inclined to give in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I do feel, based on zero, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> zero fucking scientific proof, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and just based on total
anecdotal evidence, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that there is some kind of effect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that your mentality has
towards illnesses, sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Not every time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (stutters) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> People, I'm not saying
everyone who died from cancer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> being like, You obviously
didn't try the fucking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You obviously didn't try hard enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You didn't want it enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You didn't fight it hard enough. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just have to get good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cancer is just the, "Dark
Souls" of illnesses, guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on. You just got to get good, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey speaks indistinctly)
You just got to get good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not trying to say that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why I'm saying
it's with little things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> With colds and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like when I'm way more
up for being like, "Fuck you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm going to just continue
with my day, mentally." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not like you do anything
to actually prevent it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not like you take a fucking,
You eat honey or whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I go out of my way to not take anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I never take pain killers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I hate taking them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To me, taking pain killers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is the point where I admit
defeat and I am actually ill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Even this time, when I could
feel my body getting ill, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, "No. It's
not it. I'm not ill." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not going to go out,
obviously because it's a pandemic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm going to keep working. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to go by my daily schedule, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I woke up and I'm like,
"38. That's a manageable fever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll get tested. Come back. "
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 38's pretty fucking high. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To me it was manageable until,
I remember sitting at my PC </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the first day that the
symptoms started rolling in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Obviously, at this time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't get any of the test results, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I had no idea, It could've
been a cold for all I knew. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember sitting down at
the computer, trying to work, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was just, as the day
went on, I was like, "No, body. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Don't do this. You're not ill. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You're not ill. Come on, body. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> You can power through this." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember, it was
around five o'clock, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I was staring at the script, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was trying to get shit
done, no words would come out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because I was just too tired. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Okay. I'm
absolutely fucking ill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me take some fucking medicine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me take my temperature
again. Let me do the fucking- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can just imagine you sitting
at your computer and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (imitates Garnt)
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, "Oh, God." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Shit. My willpower wasn't
enough to beat this minor cold. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shit.
- Who would've thought. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just a perception,
man. It's a perception. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It seemed that, I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> painkillers and stuff like
that, I have friends who, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> They'll take a painkiller </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the moment they even
get a slight headache. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I'm always really
worried because then they, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> the same people, this
is completely anecdotal, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They're just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, yeah. It doesn't work as well anymore </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I take it too often." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Well, that's scary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not going to take it
unless I'm really in pain." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I'll be like, "All right. Fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll take a paracetamol or something" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because what happens if they get, say, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> a really massive headache or
worse still, where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, God." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you don't have pain
medicine, you're just fucked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You might faint. You might pass out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Whatever, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I always worry about stuff like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the only scary thing, for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was because I'd never gotten COVID before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Normally when I get an illness,
I've been ill enough times </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to know how my body deals with it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, "Okay. I'm going to
be out for X amount of days. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I need to do this." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've got this down to a science. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wake up with, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What's the throat-itis? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Tonsillitis or something,
which has happened a few times. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, "Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm going to be conked out for two days. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not going to be able to
speak for three, four days, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then afterwards,
I'll be completely fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But when I tested positive, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Fuck. I've never done this before, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> so this is all new territory for me, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How's my body going to react to it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've got asthma, is that
going to play an effect?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, It wasn't like,
I didn't have a bad time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it was more of just the unknown
that scared me the most. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. That's way scarier.
- Because it was something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was something completely new </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I had never experienced before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so I had no prior knowledge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about how I should best deal with it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or how my body was going to deal with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Luckily, It was fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Second thing that I shit
myself over was everyone saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that you might lose your
sense of taste, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You know what? I think
I'd rather go to hospital </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than lose my sense of taste, honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> With the bread take you surely did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I think a lot of people
would argue you already did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You sure you haven't gotten COVID? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think you should've gotten COVID </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for the best "Trash
Taste" recording in years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Half of these food takes- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think you have
any taste buds to kill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The first thing that I
did when I tested positive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was, obviously I needed to inform Meilyne, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to inform GeeXPlus and
everyone in the office </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that I tested positive, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the first thing she
messages me about is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, I've heard that COVID
might change your taste buds, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so maybe you'll be able
to taste bread now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, "Fuck you, Meilyne." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Roasted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is not what I wanted to hear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I tested positive, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Were you hungry at all? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Did you have an appetite? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't exactly the same, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. Here's the thing I
hate about being fucking ill, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that it's, I didn't
lose my sense of taste, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it was just the same affect to your taste </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you have with any illness,
which just, for some reason, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything just tastes shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everything just tastes bland. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Man, I get super hungry when I get sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I remember-
- That's so weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Remember when you got
ill the few weeks before, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> when you got tonsillitis,
you just ate a fuck ton. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And, to me, I can't eat at all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nah. Me neither.
- when I'm ill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just don't eat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It should mean my stomach is okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have any other illness,
I'll just eat a lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - For me, when I'm sick,
just the smell of food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> is like, "Urg." For me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you remember that one
time I got food poisoning? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got food poisoning this one time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and then the next day,
while I was still dying, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I got so hungry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Felt like McDonald's. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I ordered a fuck ton of
McDonald's and I ate all of it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Weirdly, I felt a lot better. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like I'm the only person on earth </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> who binged McDonald's
and then felt better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because usually that's the thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that gives you food poisoning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. That's exactly right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You'd think eating McDonald's
after having food poisoning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is a bold choice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It was really weird.
- You're really doubling down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. Actually, the one
time I do regret doing this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> This one time I was really sick, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> again, I think, with food
poisoning, the next day, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know everyone is going to laugh, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I decided to get Indian curry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was actually a mistake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? Why?
- Why would you do that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was really craving butter
curry. I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I crave a lot of good
food when I'm ill as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but I've had it enough times
that you regret it immediately </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> once you take the first bite. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> That was the only time I regretted it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Other times I've gotten
it and I feel better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if it's, in
my mind, I'm like, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe my body's like, "Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We've got another problem to deal with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's deal with that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then everything just gets better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a load of shit, really. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Your brain works one step at time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it should be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. It's all weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like no one really
understands their body. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're all just guessing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're all just doing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> We're like plague doctors
tying to figure out our thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with our own weird rituals. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think we all just have a thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that we feel comfortable with, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and somehow it works. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, we've sorted it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> We've been ill enough times to know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how our body reacts to certain things, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and to deal with certain things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone bodies is different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll sit there and laugh
at all these plage doctors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from the 18th century, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I'll just be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm going to will power my disease away." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's only, really, Have we changed at all? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I think we've just gotten
smarter while keeping the stupid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what will fix my sore stomach? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> McDonald's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude, exactly. That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Before COVID, how often did
you guys get sick per year? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Once a year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Once a year? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are we counting food
poisoning because I feel like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> food poisoning, to me- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You seems to get food poisoning a lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Food poisoning, to me, I
don't count as getting sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. That's definitely sick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is illness. That is illness. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hear me out. Hear me out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hear me out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it's like if I poisoned
Garnt, you wouldn't be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, Garnt got sick." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You'd be like, Garnt was poisoned. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a different kind of vibe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just sickness. It's not
like something you treat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "You got food poisoning? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah. "You're fucked" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're fucked. Just deal with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know.
- What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? Wait, do you know
what food poisoning is? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not like someone slipped cyanide </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into your McDonald's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I know. I know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's like, It's not
caused by a natural cause </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> of sickness or a bacterial or virus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like something went
wrong and fucked up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. No.
- No. It is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is. It is
- It is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I know. I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's not like you got
it by accident or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean? Like
you stumbled across it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Something had to go
wrong of it to be there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I think it's by accident. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Crew Member] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. No </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Crew Member] You wouldn't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if something's wrong with
the food unless you try it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why I'm saying
I don't count that as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the natural quote of getting sick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Because, let's say you undercook chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's salmonella
in it, that's fucked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're done. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But that's not the fault of the person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who undercooked the chicken, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the fault of the salmonella- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that is why you cook the chicken. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is the disease
that comes naturally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But that's not something
you come across naturally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's not something you
would normally come across. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you mean by "come across"? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you mean just on the street. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Be like, "Oh, there's salmonella." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It takes something carried. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Garnt is carrying a
normal, I don't know, cold </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a different category in my mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, not every raw piece
of chicken has salmonella, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but there is a chance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that if you have a raw piece
of chicken and it's not cooked, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> then the salmonella, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> or the bacteria
- That's why we have steps to- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - will not be killed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> In the same way that if you go outside </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and someone has COVID
or the flu or something, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and you stand next to them and they cough, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you inhale their particles, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] You have a chance of getting it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - then you have the chance of getting it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> In my mind, I just put
it differently, I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because food poisoning is
normally just due to the lack, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Of somebody fucking up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You mean lack of- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like undercooking and stuff? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Undercooking and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or bad meat. Bad storage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not all the time, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just sometimes
- Not all the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - it might just be like a rogue- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, like E.coli and shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. That's a big fuck up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes it's jus a matter of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, there was a piece of food there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and just, unfortunately,
just a rogue disease </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or virus just happened to
fucking stumble upon it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I mean,
- And then you inhale it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - it's different though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Because then we- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you saying that food
poisoning is more preventable? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Way more preventable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But that's why you can be, Your
restaurant can be shut down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> if you keep giving people food poisoning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The majority of the time,
something like food poisoning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> is due to somebody fucking
up in the chain of, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because we have these steps. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, basically, the most times we get ill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is when someone has fucked up
and given you food poisoning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Or you fucked up and given
yourself food poisoning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mainly me. I look at it and
I'm like, "Aah. Fuck it.", </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I eat it.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I shouldn't have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So that's why you don't
count it as getting it ill </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's on you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's on you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - If I just walked pass someone
in the street who was ill, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't count that as the same thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm understanding this mentality now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not an illness, it's a self-own. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know. It seem
different in my head. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know about you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I count food poisoning as an illness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- I do count food poisoning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as an illness.
- But then again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't get sick often, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think I've only
ever gotten food poisoning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> twice in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't get it much
till I came to Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I've had it many times in Japan, weirdly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like four, three times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never gotten
food poisoning in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I've never gotten
food poisoning in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've got it, the worst
food poisoning I've gotten </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was in China. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Also sometimes in
Thailand as well. I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I got really bad food
poisoning in the Philippines. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I think food poisoning
in South-East Asia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> is just part of the experience, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah?
- Exactly. It's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Street food.
- Preventable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Street food.
- No. No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> In South-East Asia it is not preventable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That shit is everywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Crew Member] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's good the lights worked out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When I went back to
it, I was like, "Damn." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I never knew you could
food poisoning from a mango </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but I definitely got it from a mango. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That shit fucked me up, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I swear to God, every
time Sydney has oysters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she gets fucking food poisoning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and every fucking time she's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Maybe this I won't. Maybe this time." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You hear every now and then
there's those foods that's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> "Yeah. Food poisoning central." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Oysters being one of them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just poor storage. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never gotten it from oysters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> You've probably only eaten
oysters here in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Everywhere.
- Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I had it in the US, Australia. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Everywhere. And I've never gotten it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a gamble in the UK.
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. It's very much a gamble in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And, I think, a lot of
places in the US as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because it depends how well they store it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or how fresh it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's human error. See? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> This is why I don't count
it the same, in my head. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If somebody sneezes at
me in public, I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "It can't be helped." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Or "Whatever. Whatever" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Face mask.
- If somebody forgot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to fucking freeze a piece of
fish, then serve it to me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> someone fucked up and made me sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait. How is someone sneezing
on you not a human error? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, no. You get it,
Let's say you're in a plane, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> someone four seats behind
you sneezes, whatever, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> they didn't react quick enough. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like that's not, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't possibly- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They didn't react quick enough? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I couldn't then go to court and be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "This person sneezed
on the plain behind me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and didn't cover up their face." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like you can't
hold someone accountable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Whereas, let's say somebody just didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> store a piece of fish properly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's negligence on their part, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then they served it to you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I get that.
- That's why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't treat it the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't treat it the same either </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's still an illness. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Regardless if it can be
helped, or it cant be helped, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's still an illness. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why I feel like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it's not a way to- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. Would you count
cancer as an illness then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't get cancer from eating fish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. No </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No. What I'm saying is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is you treat it completely differently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's still an illness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But that's something you can just get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's just different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Most of the time-
- lung cancer? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> What if you smoke enough,
that's, technically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> human error.
- Yeah. But that's on you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's on you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So then in that case,
it wouldn't be an illness, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> according to you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But even then, stuff like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it only raises your chances, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whereas if somebody just
gives you, flat out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a completely fucked up
piece of fish or meat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that has been stored improperly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're going to get sick 100%. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whereas there are people
who've been chain smoking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from age 10 till 100 who don't get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's complete luck on that part. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But with the storage, food and all that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's like, "All right.
Somebody fucked up." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's categorically, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> someone just fucked up
and they gave it to you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and poisoned you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's different to getting an illness. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's totally different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Doctors in the comments
are cracking up right now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I bet.
- on this conversation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (crew member speaks indistinctly) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually wanna know what
people think about this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like I'm not the
only one who thinks this way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> towards food poisoning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is not a weird thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just you getting ill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's just it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But if you ask me
how often do I get ill, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I wouldn't count that because
that's got nothing to do with- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's an illness.
- No, it's not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're literally sick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If I were to just make myself vomit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> would you say that I've gotten an illness? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well then why would food
poisoning count towards that.? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because it's a literal disease. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's got no comment
to how often you get ill, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that's how often you eat bad shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's entirely different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it all depends
on your environment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but obviously if you
are in an environment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where a lot of people are ill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or are going through a wave of illness, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you're more like to get ill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In the same way, if you
live in an environment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where people are less careful
with their food preparation, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you're more like to get ill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That is a thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you go to South-East Asia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or a lot of places where the
food standards aren't as high, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's true. It's true.
- Yeah. No, it's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not throwing shade,
I'm just saying facts here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, guys? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm saying facts here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You go to a fucking street
vendor on the street, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your just like, "How
was this meat prepared? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where did this meat come from?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "From the back of my truck." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it's all risk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's all risk at the end of the day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can eat raw chicken in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and apparently here it's more safer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because food standards
here in Japan are higher. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how true that
is, how not true it is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but at the same time
you're still taking a risk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What if you're the problem? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I could be the, I could be- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What if your stomach's just weak? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, if the restaurant just gives me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> poorly stored sausage, I
think that's their fault. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That's on them.
- Well, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because the one thing I learned from, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was in the
Philippines, is that, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the food standards are
a lot lower than normal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but people don't get sick
because they just naturally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have more of a resistant stomach </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> from living there.
- Well, not always. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I'd say that's true, actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would say that's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Not with everything, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not with everything.
- Not with everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But with a lot of things that
visitors to those countries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> would immediately get sick with. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wouldn't say I have a weak stomach. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I normally don't have a
problem with gross foods </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or something that's a little off, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I mean, there are times
where I've eaten something, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I've gotten really sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "Why did I eat that?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, what do you count
as food poisoning then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you go to a country or something- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right give me an example. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Throw things at me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'll be like, "Food Poisoning or not." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You go to a country, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you taste something that your
body has never tasted before, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's totally new cuisine
and your body's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "ooh. Ooh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's not food poisoning.
- "I don't like this." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you get the shits for five days. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. That's not food poisoning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Shits isn't the food poisoning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - If it comes back up, that's
food poisoning, normally, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in my mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - To me, It's like you need to have, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Your body is literally
physically reacting in some way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it gives you a fever
or a headache or vomiting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never get,
- Something that's not normal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never get anything
like that from eating food, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but when I do eat, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> can normally remember what
it was that gave me it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because I very much felt rough
immediately after eating it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I count food
poisoning as I am conked out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in bed because I-
- Throwing up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I'm throwing up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've got a fever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Because that is, It's literally
a bacterial infection. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I think if it makes
you feel a little queasy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and it gives you the
shits, no, that's not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You do have a weak stomach for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think if you're
throwing up, you have a fever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, you have food poisoning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I would, But then I wouldn't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> In my mind, if that
happens to me, let's say I- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - You get that once a year? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Lately, it's been more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's been two, three times.
- What the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've only had that a
few times in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I order a lot of food.
I never cook myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so I think it- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it happens a lot more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Also- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why I'm saying I think it's you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's just you.
- I think it's just you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No it's not. It's not me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that's a you problem. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not the one cooking it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think you just have a weak stomach. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it's happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's not just been me
who gets it from the food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Other people have gotten
sick who were with me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, maybe they have
weak stomachs, too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing)
- No, that's not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That is not a good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Your honor, why did
you give people E.coli?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, they just got weak
stomachs, isn't it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Just got weak-"
- They just need to get good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No. No. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> No. That's not how it works. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because out of the last three
times I got food poisoning, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> two times it was sausage. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I can distinctly
remember eating the sausage </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and being like, "Hmm. Really
pink. Really, really pink.", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like, "But I think
it's okay. I'll eat it." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I regretted it immediately after. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I learned that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And the other bag was, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> The other one was from a
bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was four months off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well,-
- Well, That, again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> sounds like a you problem
- Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So that's mine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But when I, Okay, let's say I'm an idiot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and I eat a four-month- old
bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to me, if I start throwing up,
that, in no way, in my mind, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is in the same category as, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's say I got tonsillitis or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because this is me being a fucking idiot, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then I immediately
got consequences for it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> The only difference is, let's
say I go out to a restaurant, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that I didn't cook it but
somebody still fucked up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's say the sausage was off, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so, in my head, it's
not in the same category </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as getting an infection from just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know where the fuck I got it from. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it's, somebody fucked up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> With the Flamin' Hot Cheetos, I fucked up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I massively fucked up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Here's the thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You go to a convention. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> You go to a convention, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you party everyday at the
convention, you get con flu. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone gets fucking con flu. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> A lot of people get fucking con flu. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Does that count as the same thing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because you're going to
a place where you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you're probably going to
get infected with something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> along the way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because there's a lot of
people in a single area </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're putting yourself in a position </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where your immune system
is going to be weaker </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you're naturally
doing a lot of shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Does that count as the same thing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Is con flu an illness? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which category? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> The food poisoning or-? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Does con flu count as any one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Getting sick, normal sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Getting normal sick?
- Yeah, normal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's not food poisoning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like food poisoning is
in its own complete category. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Closer to self poisoning to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (crew member speaks indistinctly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in my head. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know how, Do you
understand why I think that way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or is it you just don't get it at all? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I understand why you think that way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I understand, I just
don't agree with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because it's not like
I'm going to the con, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm going around licking
floors, and I'm licking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I am just, I know that
you're at a higher risk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because you're around a lot of people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> People who aren't showering,
people who aren't- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes you shake a
hand and you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Ooh. I better sanitize
it afterwards, man." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes you know, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - My hand is getting sick.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the kids were taking photos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you're getting close to
people, people want you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people touch you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. I understand that
that's just a big risk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes I get con
flu, sometimes I don't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that's me almost squishing
six months of interacting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into one weekend. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So to me it makes sense that
there is a very high chance </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can get a sickness. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But again, it's not the
same with food poisoning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because, again, somebody had to fuck up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (chuckles)
In my head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I wonder if I'm the only, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't be the only person
who sees it this way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There must be a lot of people
in the comments who are- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, you're the first, in my head. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- You're the first person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But how many people have
you discussed this with? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> This is not a normal thing to discus. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not a normal thing to discus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I think for most people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> food poisoning is an illness. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no question about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you asked me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> "Connor, what's up? Why can't
you come in to record today?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not going to be like,
"I've been poisoned." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd be like, "No. I got sick. I got sick." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But in my head, I would
have this category, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I would label it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It just happens that now
we have to talk about it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm explaining it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I didn't realize that
people didn't see it this way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So the next time you get food poisoning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you say, "Oh, sorry guys. I'm sick.", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm allowed to call you out on that, or? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. You can be like, "Who fucked up?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who fucked up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll be like, "Did you
eat another fucking bag </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of Flamin' Hot Cheetos, Connor?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was it you or was it
the restaurant this time? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Who was it? Who's the culprit? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Here's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I get sick from a restaurant, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and you only know me, it's
like, "Oh, Connor, you." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You don't know, Let's say
this restaurant's poisoned </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> 100 other people, then you
would start being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why is this restaurant still open?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The only difference is
you only hear my side. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But obviously, normally a
restaurant wouldn't be doing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But still. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not crazy. This is just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's perception. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I sound like Alex fucking Jones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "Turn the frogs gay with the water. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You're just hearing
one side of the story." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I agree that food poisoning- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just very hard to argue </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> without sounding fucking insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I agree that food poisoning
is in a different category </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than, let's say, the flu or tonsillitis, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I would say that there
are a lot of illnesses </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that exists that can exist
in different categories, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from the flu and food poisoning. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A lot of things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in my mind,
- You count all- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're all illnesses.
- They're all illnesses. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But if you asked me,
"Connor, are you sick?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd be like, "Yes." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> If I have both. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But in my head, I don't
treat them the same way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There are millions
of different illnesses, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with millions of different
ways to prevent it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> To stop yourself from getting ill. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> All this kind of fucking shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want to bear mind,
that this is not some hard, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> scientific definition I put in my head. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is just a mentality I
have towards thinking about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't worry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People don't come to "Trash
Taste" for that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But there's always some of
these comments being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I've got to poke some holes
through Connor's thoughts." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, "Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I didn't really think
that much about it anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's just talking out of his arse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just a rough
estimation of how I view it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just don't see the benefit
in labeling food poisoning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as a different thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like that's more of
copium on your end, to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not ill. I'm not ill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why not just say they're all illnesses? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Again, this isn't something
that I ever discuss with people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is not something that
comes out in the open often. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Obviously, now I'm having to talk about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in front of a million plus people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was not my intention. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is just a soft definition in my head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> towards how I viewed the illness. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_00> - Thank you to "Honkai Impact, 3rd" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for sponsoring this episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Back to the show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But, obviously, if you're like, "E.coli", </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I wouldn't count that the same
as regular food poisoning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because that's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bringing this back to how
we started this conversation, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did this even come up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even remember.
- How often </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> do you normally get ill? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's how it started. There we go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not counting food
poisoning, once a year, maybe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Including food poisoning? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's exponential. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know
(laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That could be four, five- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - How many Flamin' Hot Cheetos
is that eaten in a year? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How risky we talking? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> How risky was my, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, last year it was four. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Four times, I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Three of them were
food poisoning, though, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> One. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So aside from this time,
the last time I got ill, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was literally two years before this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't get ill often. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Very rarely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I very rarely get ill as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I very rarely get ill to
the point where I cannot, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I cannot work.
- Function. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I need to actually take
a rest and take a break. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I feel like, I don't
know, I feel like my body, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Obviously, this is all talking bullshit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like body, even if- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] This whole episode is bullshit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because there's been points </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> where Sydney has been
fucking conked out in bed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with a high fever and all that shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I get a mild cough. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that's just it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And she's conked out for two days, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm just like, (imitates coughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "How you doing, honey?
How you doing, honey? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is why,
- You need to get good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is why hospitals scare me as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because when I'm around sick people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's right. That's how this
whole conversation started. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> When I'm around sick people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get way more scared of being sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It freaks me out.
- Of course. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Is this a human reaction that we have? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That we're scared of sick people? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's pretty natural
to be afraid of a hospital. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like that's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> natural human reaction,
- Because people die </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in a hospital. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - because you are averse to getting ill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You are averse to getting ill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - People are sick. People die there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Why would you enjoy a
place where people die? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Back when I got, Back when I had it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, it's genetic, what
the fuck am I talking about? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I still have it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's cute. That's cute. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm cute. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even if it is, it's just state of mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just (grunts) that shit away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's gone. Boom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] It's like food poisoning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Preventable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just got my five step course </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on how to get rid of any genetic illness. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I had to go to the hospital
a lot when I was a kid, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because I had to get my blood
tested every three months </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Or every six months. Something like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Anyhoo, far too often, for my liking. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I hated it because I had
to sit there for four hours, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get a test, wait, get another test, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and get results and stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then the whole time
I was just surrounded </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by very, very ill people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was always just really
scary as an eight-year-old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then I keep growing up
and just kep seeing this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like,. "Uh-oh, uh-oh, oh-oh." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And all the offices the doctors have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> are always really
cluttered, are really messy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was always like, (grunts) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the one thing I hate
about the hospital the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> is the smell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. The smell is pretty bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The smell of a hospital is just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's hard to explain what that is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. There was also- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It smells of illness.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Literally. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I said, when you're
ill, and when I was ill, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> things just smell and taste different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Of course.
- Naturally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it fucking sucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But when you go to a
hospital, for some reason, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> you get that same smell
where it's just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Man, everything just smells stale." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah. It's stale </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's the word. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's the stale smell. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like the magic, the color has
been taken out of everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's how I feel when I'm ill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It just feels like life gets
a black and white filter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being put onto it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Do you like the
smell of the dentist? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I know people who
love the smell of the dentist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is the smell of the dentist, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Swinging Tod? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the smell
of, I don't know what it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the smell of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> How do you describe the
smell of the dentist? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't go, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Brah, I'm British. We
don't go to the dentist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah. True.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. I don't
smell the dentist often. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just in and out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I want to get out there
as soon as possible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's smells like clean teeth, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but in the worst way possible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It smells like chemicals.
That's the only way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I guess so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never really thought about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It smells like hand sanitizer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That fresh- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - All medical places
smells like a sterilized- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. It smells clean
but not in a good way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because when you think of,
say, something that's clean, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like scented hand sanitizer, whatever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> or Febreze or whatever, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Usually it's like, "Oh,
that's a good smell." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's a refreshing smell. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But hospitals and dentists,
for me, I just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's clean but something's wrong." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. Hospital and dentist
smell different to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no. They smell different, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Very, very different, for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I feel their in the
same category of it's clean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's not a good clean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's too clean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Where it's like, "Nothing's
here anymore.", levels of clean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Sterilized is a good word. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it's sterile, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which I hope they are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I would very much hope
that they are sterile. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (crew member speaks indistinctly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Ashley] Apparently, the
dentist smell of clove oil </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and tooth dust. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Clove oil and tooth dust? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck's tooth dust?
- What the fuck is tooth... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (crew member speaks indistinctly) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Literally the dust.
- Gross. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] Disinfected
in formaldehyde as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It just smells like chlorine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It has a feint chlorine smell to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe the dentist I go to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if it it's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] What were they
shoving in your mouth, Joe? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (speech drowned out by chatter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if they're
next to a pool or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it smells like chlorine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - How often do you guys go to the dentist? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I try to go twice a year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just as a check up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - When it hurts.
- I think they say... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you put it in your,
Because British culture, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> British culture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We don't go to the dentist a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I only really started going, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Actually I would normally
only go to the dentist before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when I'd go to Asia, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because dentist were
actually really much cheaper. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I am before all the British tooth jokes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the comments now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you have a schedule of,
"Oh, it's been three months, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or six months or
something", to the dentist" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - My dentist emailed me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> He was like, "Where are you?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I think the say, when you're an adult, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you should go, at least,
two or three times a year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> As for a check up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The good thing with the dentist, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that even if you don't have a cavity </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> or you're not hurting anywhere, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll at least just fucking
clean your teeth for you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck. I hated them
cleaning my teeth though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why was that drill so loud? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - The water pressure thing?
(imitates drill) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In Japan, it's horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - To me, I think the worst
feeling is getting a filling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you got a filling before? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Huh? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've gotten one before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And, I don't know, that
experience as a kid </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just scarred me for life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what it is about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just hearing the drill and
just not being able to see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> what they are doing to your mouth. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you want to, Do you want to see? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you want a T.V? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what's scarier because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I need to see this in 4K. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it can be arranged, actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's that feeling of when
they hit your nerve ending </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for just a second. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Co- Host] Ow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel that in my nightmares. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Ever since I felt that
as a kid the first time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that put me off going to
the dentist ever again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The worst, for me, is when
you hear the drill sound </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's deep in your ear, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> so it sounds like it's in your ear. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I hate it because it just sounds like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> someone's just getting
into your ear, like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had a night mold made. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you go to bed, you wear
one of those plastic guards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I've got that as well.
- Yeah. I've got that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I haven't worn it though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so that's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You haven't worn it?
- Nah. I forgot to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dentist will be proud of that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know. Sorry, dentist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My dentist speaks English, too. Fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. It was really
annoying to sleep with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for a long time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I couldn't sleep with it in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It was very uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. It took me about
a week to get used to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I woke up drooling everywhere with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's a normal experience. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That happens. That happens. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I didn't start snoring </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> until I started wearing my mouth guard, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it literally force
you to be a mouth breather </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when you sleep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because you got the gap between your teeth </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It pushed my, I couldn't
breath comfortably. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Why did you need to get it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My dentist was like, "You
don't really need it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's good to just prevent- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dentist was just
trying to fuck you over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was 300 bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure they were like, "Yeah,- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Yeah, you definitely need this." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] You need this. You need this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They were like, "Yeah, I do, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> grinding your teeth isn't
an issue, but it might, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so we can get a night guard done </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you just want to be careful." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "Oh, sure." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then they did it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I just really didn't like it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I just stopped using it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I grind my teeth as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but my doctor was like, "If
you don't have this guard, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your bottom teeth are
literally going to disappear." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Oh."
- I really grinded my teeth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Please give me the mouth guard." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't really know about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until I started getting jaw problems. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think in my mid twenties, I
started getting jaw problems, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where it felt like my, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes I'd wake up and
something will feel off, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or slightly dislocated or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't know that it was an issue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until I started getting the issue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I went to my dentist
and you're like, "Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You grind your teeth a fuck ton. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You need to wear a mouth guard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because your bite is going to
get more and more deformed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, after this episode, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to schedule an appointment, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because I forgot to reply to
that email two months ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I should probably go, too.
- But I hated it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When they did the mold
thing, they put all that- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] That gunk in you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - The putty thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was so confusing
figuring out how to breath </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for a second. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where I was like, "Wait, shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> My mouth is completely
covered with this gunk. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How do I breath without my teeth? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It feels so weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wonder if that's how it
feel when you have dentures. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Just not having teeth,
it felt really strange. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Also, I remember they were
like, "Whatever you do, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do not swallow right now." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I've never had an urge
to swallow more in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that a challenge? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was like (grunts) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> They're blasting shit in your mouth, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to clean it, saying that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Do not swallow. Do not swallow." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "fuck it. Now
all I can think about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is swallowing this weird
liquid that smells like apples. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I want to do it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joe-Joe fans being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the joke or fact? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> He thinks I wouldn't swallow
but I will swallow the poison. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Next thing you'll say
is, "Don't swallow." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's true. It's true.
- My God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's awful. I don't like dentists. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I don think anyone like the dentist, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if they do, I don't trust them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think anyone
likes the hospital as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some people do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Who? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kids who want to play on the free PS2 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they have there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You talked about this, didn't you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That used to be me. I used to like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But then the GameCube
controls were robbed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wish I went to your hospital </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because my hospital didn't
have that shit at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you guys ever had
to ride in an ambulance? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> In Japan, actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In Japan? Oh, okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Because Ahki had a slight
accident at our last place, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was pretty bad, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so we had to call the hospital, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was riding the hospital, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not riding the hospital, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> riding the ambulance.
- Riding the hospital. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had to get an ambulance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> So I was riding the
ambulance late at night, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and because it was late at night, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the closest spital was closed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> makes no fucking sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You'd think hospitals
are open all the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we had to go to the next furthest one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was a 15, 20 minute ride. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And luckily, Ahki was okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> She was calming down in the ambulance, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was so fucked
up because, in my head, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> during that whole ambulance
ride, 95% of my brain was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> " Oh, God. I hope Ahki's okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and she will be able to
get out of this fine." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And 5% of my brain was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, fuck. I'm in an ambulance." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, "Whoa. This is so cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I've never been in one before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is what it looks like? Oh, shit." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would just feel really bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like I'm
inconveniencing these workers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even though it's their job.
- Even though it's their job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - My leg could be broken,
I'm like, "Oh, fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm so sorry for wasting your time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Surely someone else has a heart attack </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> or something you can go to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can get there myself. It's all right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's called an Uber. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Just call an Uber. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, it's just, I remember
I was in the emergency room, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never been in that
room before, by the way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was in the emergency room, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and this guys was just
holding onto his thumb. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought that was really fucking weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was really calm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was holding onto his thumb like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I could see- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What you mean, holding onto his thumb? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's thumb.
- He's thumb was falling off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - His thumb, it had been cut off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was holding onto it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Oh, in his hand? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was holding onto his thumb, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What?
- and he was really calm, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were talking to him, being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Are you ready, Mr. Jones, to go to the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he was like, "Yeah,
yeah. It's all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We'll go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't mind waiting a little bit." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Really weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It was really strange, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I didn't realize
what he was doing at first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until I saw the bag of ice with it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then he had a bandage
going around like this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and his hand was like this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he had bandage just going around. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just wanted him to be like,
"Are you ready, Mr. Jones?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He'll be like, "Thumbs up. Haha." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's really weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like T.V shows in the UK, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> just farmers who had their arm cut off, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're like, "Yeah. Whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Whenever you're ready." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd be fucking freaking out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> If there's one finger
you don't want to lose- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the thing you don't want to do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You don't want to freak out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> You want to be calm.
- Yeah. That's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The more you panic, the
worse it is for everyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You have to calm yourself down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But that's easier aid than done. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, obviously, I've
never been in that situation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's hard to image how you
would react in that situation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you've never
been in that situation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. It's weird, really, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because when I've been in situations </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I feel like I have
to calm myself down, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> afterwards I'm like, "Is that what,", </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You see people freaking out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are they trying to calm themselves down? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What's going through their head? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is it just panic? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] What do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Let's say, if I'm bleeding really badly, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> which has happened a
few times or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and I have hemophilia, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my whole focus, when it's
happened, I remember distinctly, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is I'm literally focusing
on not freaking out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's all I'm doing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm trying to keep it together. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I just think, I'm like, "Is
that what everyone does?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know because there's no way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to get into someone else's mind. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I wonder, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> has anything ever happened to you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> where you're really scared
and you're freaking out? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never had anything life threatening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or anything like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I wouldn't know,
myself, how I would react. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But if I know how I react
with a lot of situations, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just, yeah, calm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Calm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like trying to force yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how the, I don't know how, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> The human mind is pretty fucking weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm the kind of guy who,
in stressful situations, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just say nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, this is going off tangent now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I don't physically react </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when someone tries to jump scare me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A lot of the times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember, every time
there's a jump scare, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or anytime Sydney tries
to prank jump scare me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she goes, "Ha.", like that or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I come out the shower or whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just completely like
fucking The Terminator, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> zero reaction. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And she's just like, "Fuck you." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, "Haha, Sydney. That's right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I aint a pussy, bitch." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Whereas inside I'm just
like, "Fuck my life." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Inside, I'm screaming my
fucking heat out, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pee slowly runs down your leg. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, "Get good, Sydney." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Aah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. So I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm the complete opposite. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate it when someone
comes around the corner </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and scares me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I always stop myself
from throwing a fist out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I'm like, "It's a
threat. Oh, no. It's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not. Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Thank God. (exhales sharply)"
- It's a threat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - My fight or flight is just
like, "Fight. Oh, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. I shouldn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I shouldn't." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's weird because when
I had to call the ambulance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for Ahki, I was surprisingly calm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought I was going to be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I'd never called
the ambulance before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I didn't know what
the fuck the procedure was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> So the first I was calling,
in my head I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, God. What the fuck am I going to say? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Am I going to stutter? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What the hell's going to happen?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But then by the time I
got finished, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, I was a lot calmer
than I thought I was being." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Domino's will be here
in 15 minutes, honey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't worry about it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, can you call the ambulance now?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, shit."
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Oh, fuck" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sorry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Oh, you said ambulance.
- "Oh, shit." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought you said peperoni." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Don't worry, Ahki. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> The double peperoni pizza is
going to be here in 15 minutes" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - "You have something,
- "Oh, shit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You have something to look forward to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't worry."
- "Fuck." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fuck." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Who's going to get here faster? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The Domino's delivery
guy or the ambulance?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> My bet's on the Domino's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, no. It was surprisingly calming, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but then I think it was, for
me, I'm calm in the moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then, when it's all over,
that's when it all comes out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To me, I panic post, when
everything just sinks in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> to be like, "Holy shit.
That fucking happened.", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and, "I went through all this shit." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's only after
the even has transpired </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that it actually starts to sink in, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I start to feel the gravity </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of everything that's happened. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> At least to me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I do have a question, though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I remembered this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in the experience I had in the past week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Have you guys ever gotten fever dreams? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean by fever dreams? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Can you define one for me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the dream you
have when you have a fever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - When you have a really bad fever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you start dreaming really weird shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I thought it was just a saying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought it was just a term or phrase </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> until I started dating Sydney, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who gets some of the most
fucking weirdest fever dreams </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've ever heard in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - While conscious or while asleep? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you mean by, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What? She's just fucking waving? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm having a fever dream." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - She's running around the
apartment or is she asleep, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wakes up and then she's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Garnt, you won't
believe this dream I had. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was the president." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think that's a fever dream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's just going psycho. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can we get a definition of
where fever dreams comes from? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. So when you have, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you have a really bad
fever, obviously you try to rest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Your body tries to rest. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, at least some
people's body tries to rest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you go to sleep
and you're sweating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You start having a really bad fever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as your body tries to
fight off this illness, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then some people,
I'm saying some people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the only experience
I've seen it happen to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is with Sydney, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and she'll just wake up,
drenched full of sweat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and was just like, "Honey, I
just saw Connor in a bikini, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> running on the beach.
What the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where am I right now?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> She will say it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> She will just wake up and
say the weirdest fucking shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that happened. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "What just happened?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she goes, "Oh, it
was just a fever dream." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's believable, actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> That is a possibility. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That wasn't a fever dream,
that was just a video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was an episode
of the cosplay series. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I've never had a
single fever dream at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Actually, I rarely ever dream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The problem is, No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not that you don't dream, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I think I'm the exact same way, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whereas I don't remember 99% of my dreams. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's fucked up because it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Some mornings I wake up and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I remember having a really good dream." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then as I am waking up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm trying to remember
the dream again, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, and it's, wait, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the fuck did I just dream about?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's so weird because
it literally fades away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as I'm trying to think about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But all I remember is
that I had a good dream, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but if you told me to
recite it, I'll be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "I don't know. I don't remember." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because, to me, I feel like
I just rarely ever dream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because if I have a dream-
- No, you do dream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone dreams. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure I do.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're not a fucking reptile. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You do dream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe I am, Joey. Maybe I am. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do we have the definition
of a fever dream? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Ashley] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Fever dreams are vivid, often
bizarre or unpleasant dreams </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sleepers can experience
when they have a fever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure I've had a fever dream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Ashley] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They happen similar to the other dreams. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They can happen during any
stage of sleep, mostly- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It just seems like her
dreams, when she has a fever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just the wildest ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so strange, I
don't remember my dreams. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I very rarely remember them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe once every month. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't remember.
- Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I probably can only
remember two nightmares I had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But if I have a dream, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember the fact that I had a dream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But most nights, I wake up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there was just a void in my head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing)
There was nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There was nothing.
- Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I dreamed nothing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can you feel the sense of time passing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're aware that you're dreaming? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Have you ever had a lucid dream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. I really want to though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Those are the funnest ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've only had it,
- I've had it once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've only had it a few times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I've had situations where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what I wanted to happen in the
dream during it did happen, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I feel like it's a battle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> This is so hard, to remember this stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> This is what scientists have
been trying to figure out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for hundreds of years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you ever had a
dream that's been so vivid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it's just stuck with you for years, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and you can still recite it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I don't remember
most of my dreams. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have one nightmare
I had when I was little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that I think is the reason
why I'm afraid of heights now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> You know how they say you
can't die in your dream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you've never
experienced it before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that that's BS. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, actually, I
thought it was BS, too, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> until I had this nightmare. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm pretty sure I die
in a lot of my dreams. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You all right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Food poisoning.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Call it a food poisoning dream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've definitely died in my dreams, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but I've just woken up
immediately as I've died. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really? Do you always wake up? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Is that guaranteed? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like I reset sometimes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it one of those, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "If you die in the
dream, you die for real?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You respawn in your dreams? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm pretty sure I've
respawned in my dream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm near certain I've
respawned in my dream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The only nightmare I've had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I can still vividly remember, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a really short dream
but I was flying in my room, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then for some reason I
just stopped, and then I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and then just stood-
- I just pictured a young Joe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> flying in his room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I'm just flying in my
room, like "Whee.", like that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I just stop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember I stopped, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and our house was, it was two stories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we had the spiral staircase </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that went down to the basement floor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember I just stopped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I looked down at the spiral staircase </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just dropped. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Head first. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I vividly remember, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> my face got about this
close to the ground, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I woke up.
- And you woke up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just shitting myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think from that point
on, I got afraid of heights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Because I vividly remember
the feeling of falling, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was horrible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you had a, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Your brain made a traumatic
experience for you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- That's so strange. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To me, the one traumatic
dream that I've had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that has stuck with me for years was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember this one time,
I was living this dream, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I would wake up in my bed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my room that I was
living at at the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I would just go about my day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it would just be a normal day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then something would happen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that would just be out of the ordinary. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I would see, I would see, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would see a twin
followed by another twin, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I just noticed a glitch
in the matrix or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then as soon as I saw
that, the dream would reset, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'd wake up again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I would think that
I was in the real world, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I would go about my day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I would notice
another glitch in reality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's fucking nightmare fuel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I literally repeated this cycle, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and every time I would
get more and more paranoid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I didn't know if
I was in a dream world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or if I was actually awake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Is this a dream world?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I would go about my day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I remember the exact moment I woke up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was about the 10th time, when
I went through an entire day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking, "Okay. I'm awake. I'm awake." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember going to the toilet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was getting ready for
bed and I looked at the mirror </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then my reflection turned. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> My reflection turned away.
- What the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fucking freaked out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I woke up for real. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For real, real. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like an Ari Aster film. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It sounds like a cool film. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I woke up for real, real
and I was shitting myself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I didn't believe the
fact that I was actually awake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It literally fucked with my
mind for an entire few days. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I went about
those few days being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Where's the glitch?
When's it going to happen?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When's it going to happen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where are thew twins? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's fucked up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's scary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know how my mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> created such a fucked up situation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it literally fucked
up my mind in real life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe I'm still in the dream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Trash Taste is all a dream, baby. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - When you're dreaming, are you able, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You mentioned that you were flying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'm in dreams and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's say I do something
that I know is impossible, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> are you aware that you
know it's impossible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that you're dreaming? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I often always get aware. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm a ware that it's
impossible but I just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Because lucid dreaming
is where you're aware </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that what you're doing is impossible, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so you take full advantage of that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought lucid dreaming </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> was where you then controlled said dream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't control said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I know I'm in a
dream a lot of the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I can't control my dream </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I'm in lucid dreaming state, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's more of, it's more of, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's more like you've
realized that you're in GTA </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with cheats on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's how I imagine it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because there have been
times where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, fuck. I'm fucking dreaming. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> All right let me look. Am I dreaming? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Let me try flying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, I'm flying now. Brilliant. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm fucking dreaming. This is amazing." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - To me, that sounds
like you have cheats on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> See? I can't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Because I don't have
dreams often but when I do, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at some point in the dream, I
figure out, this is a dream. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like Inception.
- I turn those cheats on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is Inception. This is Inception. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Something will happen that
my brain chose to make happen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but I also am aware that
that is not possible, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that I am now aware
that I am in a dream, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but it doesn't change how I behave. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I know that I'm in a dream
but I still go on the dream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is so strange. What's
wrong with our brains? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know.
- Why are we so fucking weird? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had this dream recently,
I cant remember the full, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I told the dream on stream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It was something like I was in a situation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'd been falsely accused </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of stealing this game cartridge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was then arrested for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like," No, I'm not
getting arrested for this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't steal it. I refuse." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Ten I killed one of the cops and ran away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> because he was trying to arrest me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> over a fucking game cartridge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And then it turned out into
this massive shootout and stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Then I somehow kept getting away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then eventually I got caught
and then I went to prison. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I understood I was in
the dream at this point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So then, somehow, I
magically then got a phone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like in Isikai. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had this phone in prison </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that I was then using to
then play games and stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and have a normal life in prison. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I don't know why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then my charger broke, and
I remember this happened, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, "Shit.
Well, my charger's broke." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I just skipped
and I had a charger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Great. This is awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You skipped.
- This is awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is fantastic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just skipped. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just skipped the part </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where my brain had to think hard enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to come up with the reason
why I needed the charger, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It just appeared.
- and then it just went, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Boop." I have the charger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Oh, this is
great. This is amazing." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't understand why
this happens though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But did you realize it was a dream? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> About half way through the dream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I understood it was a dream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But you don't take advantage of it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know how to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was about to say I
love how in the dream </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you still got arrested. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> He's taking an L in the dream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. This is my thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> If it was my dream I wouldn't
go to fucking prison. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. You wouldn't go to prison if you- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, shit. That's right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I remember, No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is incorrect, actually, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I didn't get the charger,
I remember I got, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is where I reset. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I went to the roof of the prison </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I couldn't get
a charger so I thought, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "What's the fucking point
if I can't play games?", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I jumped off the roof of the prison, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I reset in the prison. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I died. I died. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I just, in my head,
I remember there was a jump, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember I died, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I just appeared
back in the prison again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with the charged iPhone with
a new charger or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the worst
version of Age of Tomorrow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a terrible dream. Awful dream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Age of Tomorrow, Jail version. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just don't know
why this was happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I understood it was a dream, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why can't I have some control over it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're all shit dreams.
I always have shit dreams. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - But at least you remember- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because to me, a lot of,
Say for example, last night, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me it's like, "Okay.
I'm falling asleep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Falling asleep. Falling asleep." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One second later, "Oh, it's 7 AM." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel no perception of time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. When you wake up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can you feel the time
without looking at the clock? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Sometimes, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, but not accurately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like I'm pretty
fucking good at it now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if I'm
getting old now or what. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It depends on how good my
sleep cycle is at that time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Now it's a bit fucked up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because COVID just made me
want to sleep all the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm just like, "Okay,
now I can't tell." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because my body's constantly tired, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but before then I would be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes you wake up and you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "It's going to be 15 minutes
before the alarm goes off." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you look at the time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That happens every time.
- And you look at the time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like, "I'm a fucking genius" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. Okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The reason why I asked, do you know that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is because I was, if I
asked in your dreams, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> do you know that there is a
flow of time in your dreams? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - See? This is weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I know how much time is
passing in the dream, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the real world. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Isn't this weird? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How strange is that?
(laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's against Inception rules, though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because we all, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> We all know time passes
slow in the dream world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Exactly.
- Because I wake up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after a dream or whatever, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and it'll be 5 AM and then I'll be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I liked that dream, I'm also
going to go back to bed." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I know, when I'm in the dream, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how much time is passing,
because when I wake up, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the exact amount of time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I thought had passed in the dream, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had passed in real life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Isn't this so strange? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I think that's
just your subconscious </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> counting the time.
- Maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's also like an alternate reality. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you ever have a- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who needs VR? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck them. Come in my brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am VR. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We all had VR in our minds, bruh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> In our minds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is one of the strangest
episodes we've ever done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> This is obviously the weirdest
topic we ever spoke about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you ever have a really fun dream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you get actively
pissed off when you wake up? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. (laughing)
- Yeah. Of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember some of the
funnest lucid dreams I had, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and the fucking Sydney wakes
up and is like, "Garnt, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's cuddle.", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, "Fuck off,
Sydney. I'm flying right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm flying, Sydney." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "I was on episode 24 and I
was the protagonist, Sydney. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm supposed to get what I deserve." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The worst one for me is,
when I'm having a good dream, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I don't remember
most of my good dreams, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but I remember I wake
up and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Man, I don't remember what I just dreamed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> but maybe if I go back to
sleep, I'll dream it again." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I go back to sleep
and I don't dream it again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "No. It's gone forever." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me, there's a point, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because, to me, I've had it before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I've had really, really fun dreams, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you half wake up but before
your mind fully wakes up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like, "Go back to sleep." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then sometimes I've
been able to reinsert myself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into the matrix. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm going in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm going in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I know sometimes I wake up, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "If I go to sleep now, if
I go to sleep right now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can jack back in." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I get so sad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I try to fucking
will myself to sleep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you try to will yourself to sleep, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most of the time it doesn't fucking work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But sometimes I just try
to will myself to sleep, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and five minutes passes I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (sighs) "I'm awake now. Fuck my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is the real world." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I used to do that but I
don't ever try that anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I think sometimes I'm
like, "Yeah. Whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just get on with it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I'll just dream it
again tomorrow night." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just dream it again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, do you have a theme
to most of your dreams? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are your dreams, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Because they say that your dreams </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> are normally reoccurring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> They're similar events.
- No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, not really, for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's all over the place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just die in a lot of my dreams. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't know what that says about me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> There could be some dream expert, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But even that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know how people are like-
- Dreamologist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Yeah. The dreams, they, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Whatever you do in a dream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> there's a real meaning
to it in real life." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - If you stressed out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> then you'll dream about
your teeth falling out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Where they think that every single thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can dream of has
a real life counter part. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Emotionally or feeling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure there is to some extent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but there's definitely- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably too complex for us
- Yeah. Way to complex. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to be able to solve it
with modern science. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I get really high
concept dreams sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I told you the dream I just had, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but sometimes I just
dream and then I wake up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "That was a really cool
fucking film idea." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That was a really cool film idea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How Garnt gets his videos ideas. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so weird, I don't
know how my mind works, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because sometimes I'm just
like, "Damn, I dreamed that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was such a cool fucking idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How the fuck did my mind
come up with that concept? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What language do you dream in? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> As being as all three of
us can speak two languages. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What language do you usually dream in? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. English. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - English for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I've rarely dreamed in Thai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unless it's when I'm living in Thailand, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm using it more often. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 90% of my dreams are in Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. What language
do you think in, though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Depends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's probably why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's probably why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I don't normally think in Thai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's been points
where I've lived in Thailand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then my thoughts
start getting jumbled up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I start thinking in a
different language as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How do you describe thinking
in a different language </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to somebody who only speaks one language? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know how to properly describe it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Thinking about how
you think is also weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Now I'm like, "I don't talk
to myself when I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But maybe I do talk to
myself when I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not sure." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some people can't, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Some people physically
can't think out in the air. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now that you're telling me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I'm talking to
myself while I'm thinking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> now I'm doing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But I'm pretty sure I don't do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I just do things.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just do things.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think I talk to myself in my head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I talk out loud if I talk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I remember
reading about deaf people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thinking in sign language, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and that blows my fucking mind. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't even come close
to conceptualizing it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I know it happens. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I know people do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so weird to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This episode is
sponsored by Express VPN. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] When you use the bathroom, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you always close the
door behind you, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You don't want a random
passer by looking in on you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ewe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So why would you let
people look in on you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you go online? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Using the internet without Express VPN </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like going to the bathroom
and not closing the door. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you know that your
internet service provider </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> knows every single website you visit? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And what's worse is that
they sell this information </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to ad companies and tech giants, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who use your data to target you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (screaming) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that why there's milf's in my area? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, the good thing
is, is that Express VPN </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> - I use Express VPN on all of my devices. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_06> - I would love to be able
(X-Files theme song) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to turn on my lucid dreams. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If I had that fucking power. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> That is literally, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So it's not normal or you
to be aware you're in a dream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not normal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, are you always aware? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Most of the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd say 80% of the time
I know I'm in a dream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, my God.
- Are you serious? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- You're that kid in school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that aces the tests without studying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (stammers) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because he knows he's in a
dream but he can't control it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I can't control it.
- Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like getting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> becoming a lucid dreamer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> without having the fun part
of being a lucid dreamer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's weird because I'm
aware I'm in a dream, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and I know that I can want things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know I feel that I want
the thing in the dream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it doesn't always happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know how that works. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you ever had a super
power when you're in a dream? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Many times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, define super power.
- But then I die, normally. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's too much power
to handle for one man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally, in your own mind
you're playing on hard mode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't realize it was that possible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - He gets all these super
powers and he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Guess I'll die." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm trying to think, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "Yeah. I always know at some, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd say 80% of the time, I
feel that half way through, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or at some period in the dream,
I know that I'm dreaming, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because things don't add up in my head </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> when I'm in the dream. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's weird because it feels
like I'm conscious in the dream, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so I know what's happening, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I know that some things don't add up, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm aware that I have the knowledge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from my normal human life, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I have that in said dream, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so if somebody fucking
teleports behind me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at some point, after that happens </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> X amount of times or something, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm aware then that this
is now not possible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Or if I reset. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> When I die and I would come back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is this reset mechanics? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So much in your dream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't happen often
but when it has happened, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if I die but I'm still dreaming, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I immediately know that
now I'm in a dream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I died. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Because you died? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And also, generally,
- "You can't reset real life" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what's weird as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Must be in a dream.
- I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if this is a strange thing
but when I'm in danger, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's normally a good way that I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because rarely in life
am I ever in danger, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in weird situations. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So being in danger is not a
normal emotion I ever feel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so when I end up coming
across it in the dream, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> if somebody's chasing me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's normally one really
weird way that I get in tune </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> with the fact that I'm in a dream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Because I also
very rarely dream, for one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but even more rare is
for me to get nightmares. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I see all of mine are nearly nightmares. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to say, again, 80% are
probably in the bad things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How do you sleep at night? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> You see? Okay, here's the thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> When something bad's
happening to me in a dream, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because, again, I know it's a dream, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel these emotions
towards it but then I also, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because, again, I'm aware it's a dream, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have this weird sense of, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "Well, let's just see what could happen." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I don't feel like
it has any impact on my- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. Because there's no consequences. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - on my actual emotions
I'm aware that it isn't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is this strange? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like if you have
nightmares that often then- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But that's the thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't wake up from a
nightmare being like, (grunts) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like in the movies, (grunts) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's why I always
find that shit so dumb. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I'm looking for
a nightmare and I'm like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, that happens to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I wake up from a nightmare
I'm like, "Oh, get my phone." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. I wake up and, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> If it's really bad nightmares, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> which I've had every now and then, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wake up in an actual sweat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've had my entire life,
in every single aspect, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ruined in dreams before,
and waking up like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, that's good. I'm feeling better now." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Because when I wake up I feel much better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I'm like, "Oh, good. It's-" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I've had nightmares
where something bad has happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and then you wake up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you just have this
instant sigh of relief. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When you're like, "Oh, my God. Thank fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I though my life was ruined.", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's like, "It's great.
It's fucking great right now." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm comfy in this bed.
- I'm comfy in this bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's all in, baby. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not in jail. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've had so many dreams
- I've got my charging cable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's all good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I've had a dream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where I've literally had to tell my mum </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm about to go to jail.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, yes, yes. I've had that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've had that as well?
- I've had that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Seeing her cry and break down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's cruel. That's cruel.
- was just the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wake up and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Why does my mind do this to me?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That was the most
heartbreaking feeling I've had, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> which is telling my mum
I'm about to go to jail, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I remember her fucking
crying and breaking down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and me feeling like a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Me just feeling like the
worst human in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wake up and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I've never loved my life
more than I have now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I've never felt more fulfilled." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never had that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So people in your world </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> have really depth emotional ability? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - See? That's weird, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because in mine it's like I'm
the only person who is aware </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of how emotions work and
everyone seems to be robotic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So everyone's like
an NPC in your dreams? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Kind of. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The depth isn't there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Even when my parents are in
the dream, the reason, again, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is another weird things, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the thing that gives it away, though, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - The depth isn't there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The thing that normally makes me- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not enough world building. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Clearly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> This is another thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it wakes me, When I
feel like I become, again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in tune into the dream,
that I know it's a dream, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is when people aren't acting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the way my brain knows they are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's weird because my
brain is the one making this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So why does my brain make
the people like this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then in the dream, my brain also, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like I'm playing
checkers against myself, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, "Fantastic move, Connor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You've figured out the plan." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing)
You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like what is happening in my brain? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even when you sleep you're
just trying to beat yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm beating myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're literally creating, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're literally creating
a game for you to beat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> while you sleep.
- What is happening? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The absolute state. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The absolute state of Connor dreams. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It actually makes so much
sense because, I swear, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every one of my dreams
is like a Isikai to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I literally get transported
into my own fucking story, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in my own fucking world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> There's depth in the world building there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's some high concept
dreams that I remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Characters in my dram </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually act like characters in real life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt's like, "Finally I can self-" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes when I wake
up, and someone's done, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember one time I had a dream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where Sydney murdered my family, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I remember waking up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember waking up, just as I found her, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I woke up and I turned to
her with such fucking anger, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be like, "You bitch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't believe you did
that to my mum and dad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How dare you." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Better have a good reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You better start explaining." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We were about to go to trial- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I will see you in court.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because at the time,
the emotions felt so, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The emotions felt so real to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes when I wake up and
the dream isn't resolved, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I still have those
emotions fresh in my body, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and fresh in my mind, that
it's hard to sometimes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's so strange.
- Get rid of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like those stereotypical, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the girlfriend dreams about
the boyfriend cheating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the girlfriend's dream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Wakes up, slaps the boyfriend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "What the fuck? Who is she?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "What the fuck are you on?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the exact same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I've never understood that but now I do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never spoken
about my dreams in depth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is the first time
I'm thinking, "Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe my dreams are weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe I'm the weird one."
- Yeah, that's probably it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought I didn't
remember much of my dreams </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but now that I'm thinking about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe I do just remember a lot of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I don't dream often, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but when I do dream, it's
like an event for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's literally like watching a film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's great. It's great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - This one's going into the memory bank. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also, sometimes I have dreams, that I, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> at least can only remember,
that are very brief dreams. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 30 seconds of a dream that I can remember, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I've woken up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The latest one I remembered
that I was cooking meat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't remember why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't know I was in that dream either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the mystery meat.
- I just woke up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was, Probably the thing
that gave me food poisoning. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember I was cooking meat and yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you get food poisoning
in your dreams as well? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I haven't. I don't think I have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I dint think I have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's another thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think I ever
get sick in my dreams. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> From all the ones I've remembered, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think I've ever
gotten ill in a dream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think I've ever
gotten ill in a dream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I mean, you've
gone one step above, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you just straight
up die in your dream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I never die from, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's never like a dream with
me on the bed and I'm... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm always getting stabbed,
getting thrown, getting shot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, in your dream, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you should be in your peak performance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Imagination, go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Your peak form. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it would be pretty sad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if your imagination's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Nah, you're a frail mother fucker, boy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're a frail mother fucker. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> In your dreams? Nah, you can't fly" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "How many times would
you like to die tonight?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've had drams where other
people have been sick in them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I've been around, The whole dream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has been around this person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who is progressively getting more ill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And those dreams are really depressing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Because, even though, again,
I'm aware that I'm in a dream, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't do anything to
help them, I feel like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I still feel sad </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because seeing this dream sad
version that I've made up, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> of them getting more
dead, is really saddening. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is so strange. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is really bizarre. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think one of- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is why Inception was so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think one of the
weirdest dreams I had, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which actually would be a cool concept, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is I remember one time, I woke up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and for some reason, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I knew I was the second coming of Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I knew I was- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The chosen one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I knew I was the Messiah.
- The chosen one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I knew I was the Messiah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the problem is- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I believe that's called
the sigma male, Christ. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So the problem is, The problem is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I knew I was the Messiah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but for the life of me I could
not prove it to the world. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So I would try to go out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You sound like every crazy guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I would out and I
would perform miracles, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would go out, I would walk
on water, and shit like this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I remember I would be
like, "Guys, I am the Messiah." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And everyone would be like,
"That's a magic trick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where's the mirrors at?
Where's the mirrors at? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was just me getting
progressively more, more, more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and more anger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I even went on Joe Rogan
at one point in this dream. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - "I am Jesus Christ. I am Jesus Christ." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Be like, "I am Jesus Christ.", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he goes, "Prove it then." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember I- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - "I'll turn the frogs gay right now." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I remember I took my hand out, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I just made fire in my hand. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And he's like, "That's not impressive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've seen magicians do
that. Do something real. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Do a real miracle." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All I'm hearing is, the dream gotten </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't actually about you becoming a god, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it was that you're furious with
the current state of magic, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> catching up to real life miracles. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was me thinking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if there was an actual Messiah
that got born into our world, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> how would they go about proving it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What would they need, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do sorcery. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was just me-
- it's very hard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in the modern era, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because of special effects
and all this stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, now that you say that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> someone's going to make
a fucking Jesus Isikai. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Literally take that concept. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm Jesus and I was
reborn into this world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember waking up, I was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "That's a really cool
concept." I'm glad my, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was a cool concept.
- Jesus Isikai. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fucking copyright that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now that you've said it.
- Copyright that right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now that I've said it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone can go write a story about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you guys ever had sleep paralysis? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes.
- One time. One time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have literally seen
sleep paralysis demons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you?
- Yes I have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. I've never seen.
- Wait, that's not a meme? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It's not a meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never gotten to the demon part, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I've definitely had it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I didn't believe in
sleep paralysis until I got it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's so fucking
weird because it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to explain what sleep is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is basically you're awake
but your body's asleep, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> essentially,- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - You mind's awake but your body, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I believe when you go to sleep, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> your body excretes a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Chremical.
- Your mind excretes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a chremical, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Your mind excretes a chemical </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that paralysis your body
while you're sleeping, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I believe.
- Something like that. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sound like some Hunter Hunter shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so what sleep paralysis is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that that chemical's
still in your body, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so you can't move </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but your mind is still awake.
- Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That doesn't sound right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that right, Ashley? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Can you Google that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Ashley speaks indistinctly) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Ashley] You're conscious
but you are not able to move. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So I've only had it once in my life, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I though this was nonsense before, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was on Joey's couch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - When was this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just to say, I mean,
- I've never know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hadn't proven any concrete cause, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Ashley speaks indistinctly) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Demons. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your sister was there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Your sister had come. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was weird because they
were speaking about me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was trying to get up
to say hello, but I couldn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I was face-down on Joey's couch,
trying my best to wake up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was fully aware. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I couldn't open my eyes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I was fully awake, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I couldn't move my arms or legs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it didn't feel like I was paralyzed, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it felt that even though I was
willing my body to wake up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my arms and my legs, my
whole body wasn't listening. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your eyes were closed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because when I had sleep
paralysis, my eyes were open. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh. My eyes were closed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I could feel, I was well
aware that I was awake, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was aware of everything
that was going on around me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I couldn't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just took a moment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I felt like there was a battle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> When I was telling myself to
wake up, it wasn't doing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It felt like I'm pulling a chainsaw chord. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (imitates chainsaw) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could feel like I was
trying to get through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and it wasn't happening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't understand why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And eventually I woke up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - For me it was so fucked, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because I clearly just
remember opening my eyes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> looking around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like five in the morning. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I saw the clock. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was looking around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Your eyes were moving around? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was darting my eyes around, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like," Why can I
not talk or hear anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> or move my body?"
- That's so weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was so fucked.
- You couldn't hear anything? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I couldn't hear anything either. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I couldn't hear anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I tried to open my mouth to say something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and my mouth just wouldn't move. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - See? This is one of those things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I feel like it's
definitely the mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like this is like a fucking, A glitch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck else do you think it is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> The demons? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is why I think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a chemical, I'm like,
"I don't know though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Because to me it just
sounds like a neuron fuck up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in your head, like you hear
the (imitates Windows shutdown) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> It's restarting. It's
trying to figure out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So what happened? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you go back to sleep
after your sleep paralysis? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I woke up after 15, 10 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I went back to sleep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, because this was,
I'd had a full sleep, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was waking up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I woke up and I just
couldn't move my arms or legs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for a little bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It wasn't like a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it wasn't like I was trying to
move it and it wasn't moving, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could even figure out how to move it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Really strange. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't understand how this works. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I remember the one
time I got sleep paralysis, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and I literally saw a
sleep paralysis demon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - What? What did it look like? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay. I call it a sleep paralysis demon. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It just look like a ghost. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So what happened is, I
was sleeping on my bed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I remember not waking up immediately, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I remember just opening my eyes a bit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and seeing this ghostly figure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, "What the fuck is that?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Immediately I punched my eyes open </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I see this female figure
praying above me or something, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sydney. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No. It wasn't Sydney. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - She was like, (grunts) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it was literally this,
looked like a nun or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was just praying above me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And I start freaking out
because I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "What the fuck? There is a
literal ghost floating above me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How old were you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was around 24. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. So I wasn't young, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was, yeah, around 24. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember my mind going
into fight or flight mode. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I start panicking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because obviously if you
see a fucking ghost floating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> floating above you, you start panicking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I try to start moving my
fucking body to do something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I remember my body
just would not move. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a terrifying experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] That's so strange. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It was a terrifying
fucking experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember, it took
me about 10 minutes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 10 to 15 minutes for me
screaming at my body, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like, "Aah. Go on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Move. Move </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're going to die. You're going to die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're going to die now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This sounds like a dream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't a dream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It felt like, No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it felt like a dream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and not like a dream at the same time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I was obviously in my
room but after 10, 15 minutes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I actually, finally was able
to will my body to just sit up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember I immediately sat up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I looked up and I could see the figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally fading away as I sat up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was super, super fucking surreal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's why I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, was that the fucking
sleep paralysis demon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that everyone fucking memes about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You mean that thing actually exist? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck? That's so weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like some Persona shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe it was just my Stand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just lost your Stand, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You could've gotten a Stand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (imitates anime character) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Put a dick in my
mouth right now, please. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Please, I'm begging you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. Another question. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> When you dream, do you
visually see your surroundings </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the exact same way? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I don't-
- What do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. I'm seeing this right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm seeing the real world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's way fuzzier when I
see things in my dreams. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Aah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's say I know there's a table there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I can't give you the detail of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know what everything is around me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just know that object is there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I know everything's around me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but I can't visually see
everything that's happening. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Really strange. Do you have this as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. Mine's in fucking RTX, on 4K, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - See? That's so strange.
- 60 FPS, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Mine's in a fish-eye lens. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why for me,
- What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why for me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What the fuck is wrong with us? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sometimes it's so hard for
me to tell the difference </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> between when I'm dreaming
and when I'm awake </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because my dreams are so vivid and so, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I said, they have
a lot of depth to them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that sometimes I wake up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and sometimes I immediately
know that I've just woken up, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and sometimes it takes me
a few moments to realize, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Okay. I'm actually awake now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> This is the real world. I'm
not in dream world anymore." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think, for me, things that are fuzzy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> is things that don't exist in reality. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If it's like a table for instance, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then I can clearly see that it's a table. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But if it's a fucking fairy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then it will probably look fuzzy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, you know when
you're trying to remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a moment that happened, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have a picture of it in your head. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> You don't have it in 4K,
RTX, the way that you saw it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's fuzzy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> You remember where
everything was, you think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The way that you recall
things that happened, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like that, the way
I see stuff in dreams. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't see it perfectly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> If I'm focusing on this
table, I know Garnt's there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for example, but I can't see Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Does that make sense? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Items that I'm aware that
are there in the dream, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't see them unless I'm
then paying attention to them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Because then your
brain has to render out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. It's rendering. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's rendering. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you know it's there
but your brain's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I don't want to render
this out right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I know that Garnt's there, I
just don't want to render out." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got to upgrade you
brain's graphic card. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it's true. It's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Because when I picture Garnt now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't need to see that
Joe's in the corner of my eye </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's in the corner of my eye. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But when I'm trying to
remember the whole picture, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in my head, when I'm in
the dream, it's like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> When I can't- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your brain does a sequential rendering? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you still running a 1060? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My draw distance is low as possible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When I'm walking up to the building, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it starts to come into frame. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a load of shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What a weird fucking, What a weird shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like that, though,
where the dream doesn't exist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> unless I'm focusing on it in the dream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you ever had a
dream that's taken place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in somewhere that you're
very familiar with? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - All of my dreams are in
places that I've been to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in real life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - See? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Most of the time my
dreams are in new places </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I'm not aware of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think my brain is capable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of coming up with new
locations in my dreams. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - What I think it is, I
think it's stitching together </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> things that I've seen
in passing or a picture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And what I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't visualize a lot of things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but I just know what's
happening and I have an idea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's really strange. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of my dreams are in my house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> They take place in my house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really?
- That's strange. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I never have dreams in my house, ever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - But all sorts of fucked
up shit happens in my house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that shouldn't happen in my house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, wait. Which house? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Japan? Japan? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - The house that I'm currently in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, the house- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When your dream start, I'm
sure it's not, credit sequence, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> shot to do, Joey opens up, "Hey." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Do you just wake, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, "Game start." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> You just start in a weird ass location, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're like, "What
the fuck is going on?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. It's always mid conversation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never remember the start of my dreams. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just like, "Oh, wait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, I guess we're here
now.", kind of thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess I only remember my dreams </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when I realize I'm in a dream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I never remember how I get there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I don't see the
PlayStation boot up logo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like, "Oh, I'm in the game." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just like, "Oh,
Dreamcast start. Brilliant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's almost weird because I
feel like when I'm dreaming, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm watching a video and
at some point in the video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll know that's me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Does that make sense? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a series of events unfolding, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm not necessarily
constantly in that brain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the person experiencing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is so strange. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is really weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even stranger question, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have you ever dreamed in third person? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That, to me, is the
weirdest fucking dream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because for some reason, in my dream, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it makes sense that I'm
seeing myself in third person. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Even though I've never
experienced that in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That prison one, it was
weird because I remember, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is going to sound so strange, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember shooting the guns, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but then I also remember watching me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after shooting the guns. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it flicks between
first and third person? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And the weird thing is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that I then was able to
feel the emotions of both. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> When doing the dream act </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then when watching
me do the dream act, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> This is so, This is so, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never spoken about this before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never spoken
about his before either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now that your talking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Now that you're making
me think about this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm realizing how weird
this sounds to say out loud. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This must sound so bizarre. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if anyone else is- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think a dream
conversation is going to be normal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never had a conversation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just about my dreams before with anyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The best way I can describe how it is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is, you know when you're playing Halo </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's that theater mode, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where at just any point you
can just unclip from the camera </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But I'm not choosing where the camera goes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'm seeing it from a perspective, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I don't understand who's
or what it is occasionally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes I have amazing
cinematography in my dreams. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - If only the YouTube videos could match. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know how it happens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but sometimes I'm in first person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and then I go to a new area or something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I have this really-
- Area unlocked. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - A new area on the map or something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and my dream switches to
this establishing shot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> of this new landscape that I'm in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Garnt's swamp. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I'm just, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I remember thinking in the dream, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Damn. That looks cool as fuck.", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I load back into
my character or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how to describe it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so fucking weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, your dream has cut scenes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that what you're saying? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This man's dreams
literally has cut scenes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And when it's over he goes
back into first person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Holy shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes I dream in games or- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your dream sounds like
a Kojima game, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Sometimes I dream in games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and sometimes I dream in movies, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is why it never makes sense to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how I can possibly dream in third person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and at the time it makes it makes sense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you never see
yourself in third person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - By third person, do
you mean like in a movie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from a movie camera standpoint? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or are we talking GTA, behind yourself? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes both.
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's weird
really because, again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I know that I'm in this situation </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I fully understand that it's a dream, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but I never, ever think
that this is wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I'm in the moment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's what my mind is making up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> so it always feels natural
when I'm in this dream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - For some reason, I'm just
fucking remembering this now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> talking to you, every time
I'm in an interrogation room, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's never POV interrogation room, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's always side,
- It's the interrogation shot? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It's always side view. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like this is fucking JCS </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Criminal investigations or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why.
- That sound fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Anytime I have a conversation
in the interrogation room, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm always in third
person, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It always feels like I'm in
control of what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure that's purely because
we've just consumed media </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where they portray those things like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd be interested to see if another person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who has never scene an
interrogation scene in a movie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how they would view that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I've never been in
an interrogation in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So I guess it makes sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've also found, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that if I'm highly anxious about something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when going to bed, there's a 90% chance </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my dream is going to be about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's only ever happened a few times, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's only ever happened </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> with homework and exams for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was playing that
Pogostuck game recently and, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did it give you nightmares?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had nightmares that I
was stuck in this game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that I couldn't
stop playing this game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I couldn't beat it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I was making, I
played it for eight hours </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I made no progress. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I went to bed, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all I could feel was me
playing the game in the dream, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I was playing it
and I couldn't get out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It was horrible.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a nightmare. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was a nightmare.
- That's a true nightmare. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was a horrible nightmare. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a scarier
nightmare than you dying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The worst part was, I knew
that I was in a nightmare, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was getting more annoyed
because why am I wasting time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I could be actually doing this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But instead I'm in the nightmare, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stuck in a cycle playing
it in my nightmare. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> What a weird thing to dream up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you ever have moments
where your dream is so intense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you don't feel like
you've slept at all? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wake up more tired than
before I went to bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. I've never had that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes, because you go
on such an emotional journey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in this dream, or at least I do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that I wake up just exhausted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So what do you do then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just get another eight hours? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't. I get up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get up but sometimes I just feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I haven't slept at all, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just because I feel like
I was awake in my dreams, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I really didn't sleep at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. It's really weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The worst nightmares
I've had is I go to sleep, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously tired, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm probably not even
in the right state of mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before I go to bed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hence the reason why I have the nightmare, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I have that nightmare. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I wake up in that fucking cold
sweat, like (breaths rapidly) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Fuck." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm so tired after that but I
don't want to go back to bed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know if I close my eyes right now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just going to be
like, "To be continued." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just going to happen again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why is it where you have a fun dream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you can never get back into the dream? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When you have a nightmare-
- The nightmares </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> are waiting for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you have a nightmare,
you go back to sleep, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you re enter the nightmare? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I think it's
putting stress and stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's probably a mental state. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just comes out from behind the tree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like Freddy's like, "Hey, guy. Hey, boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, you sleeping yet? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I find it so much easier
to re enter my nightmares </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than to re enter my fun dreams. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can I get a round of applause, everyone? </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. So since we're on the dream topic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> do you guys sleep talk? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I sleep talk.
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think I sleep talk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I generally just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is going to sound
terrible, just screams. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you serious?
- I shout in my dreams. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's probably every time you die, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, he died. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You've been around me
when I've sleep talked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never heard you sleep talk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I've heard you snore very heavily. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know if you're screaming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or just a loud cuddle snore.
- or snoring, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> or if it was Chris fucking snoring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (screams) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like that.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not that loud but like, (screams) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like that.
- Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you ever sleep talk
when you did your subathon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you slept on stream? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I muted the mic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, you muted the mic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just in case I was fighting that dragon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that can only be defeated by racism. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I only ask </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because Ahki has recently
started sleep talking a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm concerned because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by sleep talk, she
randomly shouts out phrases </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just don't make sense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when you think about it
in a sequential manner. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Ahki is the kind of person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who, literally, head touches the pillow, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three seconds later she's snoring. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Instantly like that, which
I'm so fucking jealous of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then, now it's gotten to the point, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where three seconds after
the head hit's the pillow, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> start snoring, five seconds
later she says a random thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I thought, The first time she did it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought she was joking, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it happened in
the spa of 10 seconds. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I just started laughing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember her, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> She's like, "All right. Good night.", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goes to sleep, starts snoring,
and then she just goes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "legs"
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like," What the fuck was that?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe she was in one of Garnt's dreams, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she's reading the title card.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Chapter 3. Legs.
- Chapter 3. Legs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I started laughing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, "Come on,
sweety. What are you doing?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But she continues to snore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Wait. Are you serious?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then she goes, "butt fries" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I had to shake her awake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Are you
fucking with me right now?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she wakes up and she's
like, "What time is it?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "It's been 20
seconds. What are you on?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because in her head it's
like an hour has passed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Again, whenever I sleep, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I always know how much time
has passed when I wake up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't understand how. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Sydney has a lot of
nightmares when she sleeps. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I know when she's
going through a nightmare </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because she's just in panic mode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can tell when she's running
away from a fucking monster, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because she's just, (breaths rapidly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that.
- Too much NTR. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have to wake her up and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "You were in a nightmare, honey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't worry. Don't worry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're in the safe zone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm here. I'm here." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is she like when a dog
has a dream of running </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they just start kicking their legs? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so obvious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so obvious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not only when Syndey is dreaming, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the type of dreams she's having. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because she won't say words
but she'll make noises, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> depending on the type
of mood that she's in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So if she's having a nightmare,
which is most of the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she'll start panicking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She'll have a panic attack in her dreams </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all this kind of shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When she's happy she'll just laugh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just smile at all this shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so obvious to say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes I see her </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and she just as the
biggest smile on her face, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, "I wish I
was you right now, Sydney. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you're having
a fun dream right now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know why seeing someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with a huge fucking grin as they sleep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is the creepiest ever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Could you just imagine
walking into the room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and someones just as they sleep? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's really creepy.
- That's so creepy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I completely forgot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't scream, sometimes I
physically laugh myself awake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Something really funny happens </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or someone said a really funny joke, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I actually physically laugh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was just like, "Oh. I was dreaming" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now that you mention it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think I've ever had funny dreams. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never had a funny dream either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You've never had funny dreams? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
- No, wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's so strange. Now
that you've mentioned that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm depressed, even in my dreams. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's always something
fucking extreme in my dreams. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. I've never had funny dreams </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I guess I'm in a deep sleep, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but most of the times. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Have you ever had a micro dream? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It's when you're really, really tired, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're not completely, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's so weird to describe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because you don't feel like
you're completely asleep </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but then you start
hallucinating some shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like a day dream? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. Not like a day dream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What does a day dream count to you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Count for you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Day dream is just, you're
just bored, sitting there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you just start imagining some shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you're actually,
really physically tired </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you start going to sleep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> You're not completely in a deep sleep </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you still start dreaming as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's half, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would say it's like half a lucid dream </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's so easy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes I wake myself up by falling over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you get the fucking jerk, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like, "Oh, fuck." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Inception method. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - The Inception method. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you're just like, "For fuck's sake. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I was so, I was so close to being asleep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I had to jerk myself awake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then sometimes someone
says something funny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in that brief, micro dream
and I laugh myself awake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "For fuck's sake.
I was so close to sleeping. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was so close to actually being asleep." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want to be there
when you experience that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just to see how fucking weird
it is from my perspective. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just Garnt just sitting
there and just, (chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've never seen Garnt do this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It's weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I very rarely micro dream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, it's really weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You must have had the dream
where you jerk yourself awake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Have you ever had that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You could've phrase that better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why are you saying it like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You could have phrased that better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your body literally jerks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you hallucinated that you're, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Is there another word I could use? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like that's the best,
- Jolt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jolt?
- Jolt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. Jolt yourself awake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Did you jerk yourself awake?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. "Did you jerk your, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, thank God. You're awake." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Oh, I'm back, baby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm back."
- Oh, thank God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jolt. I've never used the word jolt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm going to wake up, aah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think I've
ever used the word jolt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We need some synonyms
for jerk right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've had those stereotypical,
on the train times, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where you're just closing your eyes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's a long rain ride. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you have that thing
where you fall forward </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're just like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that what you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm talking about where you literally- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or you're literally in the dream? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're literally in half a dream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you imagine falling
over or tripping over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that happens a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. I do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I kick my leg out or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's what I'm talking about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But instead of imagining that I'm falling, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes I imagine someone
saying something funny </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or something funny happening
and then I just laugh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's an emotional joke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. It's like an emotional joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No I don't have that.
I don't have that at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes you imagine
a ball flying towards you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you jerk yourself awake as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. That's happened a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's happened a lot
in my dream as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because sometimes I won't
be dreaming of anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it will very quickly cut </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to a ball being thrown at me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't understand why that happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Think fast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll literally not be in a dream, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not a dream, not a dream. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And then something just
flies at me and I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I just fall back to sleep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not like I'm full awake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No. That's what I mean. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's a micro dream where
you're not fully asleep </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but you're not fully awake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you brains just
like, "Haha, think fast." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Think fast, mother fucker. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You're fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Go back to bed. Go back to bed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like sleep walking.
- It's just a prank. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you ever met
anyone who sleep walks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> ever sleep walk yourself? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - My uncle, apparently, used
to be a really, really bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sleep walker and sleep talker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> My dad would tell me
stories of how my uncle, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because they used to sleep in a bunk bed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So bizarre, isn't it?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's such a crazy thing.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then he'd just,
there was one time where, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Actually, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have a story of when
I sleep walked once. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The only time, apparently,
that I ever sleep walked, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was when I was little. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was maybe four, five years old, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and apparently I walked
into my parents room </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was asleep. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And my mum saw it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> She was like, "What the
fuck are you doing?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And the she realized
that my eyes were closed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And she was like, "Oh,
fuck. He's sleep walking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was saying something to her
but it wasn't really words. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just like, (babbles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Wake up, you dumb fuck." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> The moment she went,
"Wake up, you dumb fuck.", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was when I walked over to
the corner of their room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was a washing basket, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and apparently I pulled my
pants and tried to pee into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. That's so weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then my mom was like, (exclaims) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have a worryingly
similar story. Not of me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's so crazy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> So my little brother had a sleep over </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with one of his friends. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was the one who was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd stay out awake a little
longer than I should have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I played on my Game Boy, whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And our house, the floorboards
creek really fucking loudly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And obviously I've been
in this house for years, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so I could tell, based off what creek, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where someone was in the house </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and where they were coming from. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And what point they were on the stairs, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> what point they were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like some kind of fucking Dare Devil shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> except only for my house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I heard someone who kept walking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the middle top of the stairs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and then back to my little brother's room, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then back to the stairs, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then back to my little
brother's room really slowly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then after this
happened twice, I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I went and I watched, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he just walked to
the top of the stairs, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mumbled something and then went back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then he went to the top of the stairs, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and this is where I was getting worried </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm like, "What if
he just like falls down?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's dangerous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - So he just starts walking
down the stairs really slowly, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and this is where I was
like, "What do I do?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I didn't know
what you're supposed to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when someones sleep walking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've heard loads of,
you've heard myths like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> " IF you wake them up they
can die.", or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I was like, "It seems
like he's doing it okay." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't want to wake him up
because what If he wakes up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I would. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd jump. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, "Think fast." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Haa. You're awake" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, " Shit. What do I do?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I see that he starts
walking down the stairs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but doing this thing where
he's going back and forth, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I'm like, "Guh." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I saw that he was mumbling, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so was like, " I think
he's sleep walking." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I go, I follow him, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's going down the
stairs really slowly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he gets to the bottom of the stairs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so I go to the bottom of the stairs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then he opens the
door to the living room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just goes in the living room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is like the fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, this was a horror film. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He stood there, pitch black </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I didn't turn the lights on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so scary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All I had was my Game Boy SP Advanced, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I light the thing.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't want to turn the lights on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I didn't want to- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Think Phasmaphobia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, the shitty
max brightness slider up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to figure out what's
going on and I see him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And he's just standing there mumbling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for a good 10, 20 seconds. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm freaking out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I'm like, "What do I do?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Do I go and wake my little brother up, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do I go tell my parents? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because I don't know
what he's going to do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was just watching him, making sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Bare in mind, I was 14, 15. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't know what the fuck was going on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so he's standing there in
the middle of this living room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then just slowly starts
walking towards the T.V </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then walking back to where he was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he walks to the T.V, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's my video games
all there in one of those old, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 2000's metal racks where
you just slide it in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And then he just starts
pulling down his pants </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I was like, "No, no, no, no." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Not on my games"
(laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's where I woke
him up and I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "No, no, no, no, no." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he woke up was
and was like, (babbles). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like that. It was really weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did he react to you just standing- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - He acted like I was the weirdo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember being like,
"What are you, What?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He reacted like I was being
weird because I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Stop. Stop.", shaking him. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I was exactly the same as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My parents were like, "What
the fuck are you doing?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "What do you
mean what the fuck am I doing?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I looked down
and my pants were down, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like, "Oh.
Okay that makes sense." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - He hadn't gotten them
down but he was undoing them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's where I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "You're not pissing on
my fucking PS2 games." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, no. My pants were fully down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> My hand was on my dick
and I was ready to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on this full basket of laundry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "Oh." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - So when you woke up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did you momentarily think
they were the weirdos? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Okay. See? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I looked over and my
mum was, really worried look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and shaking me.
- That's what I got. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like, "What's the problem?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't even really know this kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I barely knew him so I
was, we never really, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Whenever I saw him, it was
always awkward after that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because he just always
remembered that time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where he woke up, and I
was like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, he almost pissed on your games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> He nearly pissed on my PS2 collection. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> My Wii, probably, I
don't know what it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you ever get to the point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where there's something
happening in the real world, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you hear a sound or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or you need to go to the toilet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it gets integrated into
your dream for a good while? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, Maybe, but
I probably don't remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The most annoying thing for me is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is when I need to go to
the toilet in my dream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I don't immediately
wake up when I go to the toilet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> or when I need to go to the toilet, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but luckily my brain has a disconnect </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> between my body and my brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because there has been several times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where I really, really needed-
- I'd shit the bed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's been several times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I really, really needed to piss. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In my dream, I don't know I'm dreaming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but I acknowledge the fact </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I really, really need to piss. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I've had several five
minute pisses in my dreams </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the feeling of the
piss just won't go away </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because obviously I'm
only pissing in my dream </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and not in real life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm urinating and I get
so frustrated in my dream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because no matter how much I urinate, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the feeling of needing to
urinate never goes away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's really weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I feel something, if
I piss myself in my dream, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm pissing myself really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's 100% happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I almost shit myself doing that once. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hold up. Hold up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> First of all, let me ask
another few questions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> How can you replicate
the feeling of pissing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> so accurately in a dream? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> To me, that's weird.
- Without actually pissing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> in real life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't replicate feelings. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know that it's not
accurate in the dream. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Does that make sense? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When I get punched in a dream, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't feel like a real punch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can distinguish between that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> For me it feels real.
- You must be on some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Inception, fifth level dream. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I'm not getting this shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What are you experiencing?
- We're still on level one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sad that I'm like, "So what?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like five level deep,
- Holy shit, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Five levels deep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm in front of this urinal, pissing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Why is the feeling
urinating not going away?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Holy shit. You're on some other level. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is there an establishment
shot of the toilet as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> before you start? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're at level 10 dreaming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm at level two. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> This is insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> At some point in the dream, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I just give up on trying to
get rid of this urination. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I go on with the dream and
then I wake up and being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's why I needed to
piss, because it was a dream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I need to piss in real life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And you hadn't pissed your pants? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. I hadn't pissed my pants. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I had the most
satisfying piss in my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when that happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because, for me, every
time I've had a dream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was a kid, of going to the toilet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have 100% pissed my pants.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wake up and I'm just like, "Oh, fuck". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love the confidence. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm doing it. 100% </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And because of that, one
time I almost shit myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> when I was asleep.
- And he's 24. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here's the problem of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> growing up with a bidet your whole life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and with a heated toilet seat, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is the fact that, as a kid, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just ingrained into your head of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, my butt is warm?
I'm sitting on a toilet." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so in my dream I'm on the toilet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and can feel that my butt is warm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's a heated toilet seat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So in my head I'm like, "Oh, butt warm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm on a toilet. This is reality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm actually going to take a shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so in my dream, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember I almost start taking shit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but then I was like,
"Something's not right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Why can I not shit right now?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I had the feeling that I
needed to shit but I couldn't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Nothing was coming out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it wasn't a
constipation type of thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> It was literally I know I need to shit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but nothing's coming out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - How come we always talk about shit? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I woke up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, "Oh, now
I actually need to shit." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was prairie dogging. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Oh, God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was this close to
shitting myself in my bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's so strange. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> In my dream I'm able to
communicate to my non-dream brain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> being like , "Oh, you need to piss." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, no. I'm not like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I can stop the
dream if I need to pee. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I can control that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh. There's been so many instances </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I know I'm in a
dream, I'm in a nightmare. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. It's every time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm in a nightmare. I
know I'm in a nightmare. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't wake up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, "Garnt, wake
up now. Please wake up." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember one time I was getting chased </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by this murderer or someone like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like a scene out of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> What's that Jack Nicholson film? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The Shining. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was like the scene out of The Shining, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where I'm getting chased
by fucking Jack Nicholson </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or something and I knew
I was in a nightmare, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I just didn't want to
experience dying in the dream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it still felt real.
- Yeah. Of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm just like, "Garnt, wake up." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Nothing happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Garnt, I know
you're dreaming right now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know you're fucking dreaming, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking murderer goes around the corner, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> start fucking legging it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Garnt, I know
you're dreaming right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Wake up" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And my body refused to
wake up until I died. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why my
brain is such an asshole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I can't wake myself up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, "Nah. You
want to experience this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I think I can only force, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I choose to wake up when
I need to pee or shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. Okay.
- Oh, I can't even do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - In the dream, I'll feel it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I know that when I'm
experiencing this dream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I can feel this urge.
- Sensation, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I know that I need to do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I won't stop the dream
unless I get to a point </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> where it feels uncomfortable, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I think I'll just
be like, (exhales sharply) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Damn. You're on 5G, I'm on dial up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's so strange.
- "You need to piss. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You need to piss." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And my brains like, "All right. Hold on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sending the morse code right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's going to take a while." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Weird, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I wonder.
- And then it's too late. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm sure people in the comments
have even weirder dreams. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm curious now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I don't think I've
ever had such an in depth talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> about my dreams before.
- I've never spoken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> about my dreams before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't even know it was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought it was normal that
you knew you were in a dream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought that was normal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a lucid dream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why they call it a lucid dream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not for you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like everyone had that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Because that's mainly the one I have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've tried using methods to lucid dream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because there's tutorials on,
"Here's how to lucid dream." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> One of them was like, "Cut
a ping pong ball in half </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and put them on your eyelids. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So people want to lucid dream? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because they want to
control their dreams. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They want to do whatever
they want in their dream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because most people when
they now they're in a dream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can control their dream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have no, 99 times out of 100, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I have no control of my dreams. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's weird. When I have- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why would you want to
control your dream, though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - So you can do whatever
the fuck you want. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just use you imagination. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Just fucking do it normally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do it awake.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. I can't fly in my dreams. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't fucking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> run at a million miles an hour. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can if my brain forces
me to experience it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> But I can't just be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't just be like, "All right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Tonight I'm going to dream
about fucking 100 bitches. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Doesn't that take away
the excitement of dreams </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you choose what you're doing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. It just means, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I said, it's literally, to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like playing GTA with cheats on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Where you just have fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> To me, it's just having
fun in this open world. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> At that point people are NPCs, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I realize that this is
a dream and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Haha. I can do whatever I want. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can fly to a different city. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. I can jack cars." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Its fucking great. I have so much fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would be interested </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in someone psycho analyzing our dreams. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Honestly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because we all, obviously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have three different
perspectives on how we dream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and the experiences we have when we dream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so bizarre.
- This has been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a very bizarre episode of "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dreamologists out there,
is that what they're called? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dreamologists. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sounds like a Disney job. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dreamologist?
- Dreamologist? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What are your experience with dreams? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you relate to us? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you have something entirely different? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Let us know because I, Genuinely I- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Joey or Kahn? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Garnt.
- Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Connor, Joey or Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Genuinely because I've
never heard of anyone, really, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talking about their dreams in depth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Strange. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. This is a first
time for me as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow. Weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what isn't weird though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Our Patreons.
- Hell yeah, they're not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I bet they have awesome dreams. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing)
- Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - They can control their dreams </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like you can control yourself </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> it's going to be the wildest
week in the subreddit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> But that's been this dream
filled episode of trash taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Don't worry. This wasn't a dream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This entire episode has felt
like a fucking fever dream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's how this episode started, actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Talking about fever dreams. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm going to wake
myself up from this dream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Sorry, I need to piss. </SPEAKER_03>
