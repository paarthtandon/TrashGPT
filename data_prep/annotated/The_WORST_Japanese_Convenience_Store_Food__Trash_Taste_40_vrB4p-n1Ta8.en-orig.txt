<SPEAKER_06> now if you don't know anything about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> convenience stores they are pretty much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> found in every </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 100 meters yeah literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> every every block of land there's at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> least one convenience yeah literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you like look into houses to rent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one of the selling points </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is literally the meters away from the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nearest convenience store </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're looking at listening for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> houses that's that's how much they care </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> about convenience and if you live in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> tokyo they'll most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> hundred percent be like three within </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your vicinity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah absolutely um and even when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you go rural areas you're driving around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> there'll be nothing and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> suddenly there's a corner you'll just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> see this perfect immaculate 7-eleven </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just there yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's great because it's not like a gas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> station where you're like yeah [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> god i gotta get with those hot dogs that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> are probably gonna give me salmonella </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i'm probably not gonna like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's legit good food so yeah we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> picked a bunch of items today that we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all kind of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah uh that we could find because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes the items aren't available we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pick the items that we we normally buy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when we go to our convenience store of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> choice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then we got our intern to buy a lot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of other random [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from convenience stores just to show to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you guys what comfort zone a little bit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah going out of our comfort zone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> just to show you what is available at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> japanese combinations yeah we definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> haven't tried all the things we're going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to talk about today so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of a learning experience also if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you're an audio only listener this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just going to be eating asmr </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this is very this is going to be the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> closest to the figure episode that we've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> released </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um in a while where if you're an audio </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> only listener i apologize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but yeah shall we just kind of jump </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right into it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> now i i think i know what i want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> start off with because this is the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> debate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i think started this i episode idea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> which is fried chicken right now i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> care about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how good the rest of the combini food is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how i judge companies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is the fried chicken right right okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because when i moved to japan you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we we've we think that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot a lot of americans you know they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they would like to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stand their fried chicken but a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the best fried chicken i've had has come </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from asia </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and combini fruit fried fried chicken is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> way too [ __ ] good it it it should be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> illegal to make fried chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> taste this good it's like restaurant </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> quality yeah yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you go to the combini there'll be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hot food sections right where you can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> get various amounts of hot food but the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fried chicken is like the selling point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they'll often have a whole section </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably the first thing you'll see yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it normally comes in as the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> gentleman will show you it comes in this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> little pouch like this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> right but it does it doesn't come in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pouch it comes it's on display on like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> heater </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they put it in a pad and then they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> put it in a pouch and what you can do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is you just rip off half half the pouch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> unless you're a lawson </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you have to open it from the top </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> left i don't mind that i don't mind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> squeezing it out this is the lawson </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fight look at that look at that man is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> family look convenient okay convenience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> store points down because look how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> convenient yeah exactly look at the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> convenience of this look at that look </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at that where's the [ __ ] seasoning on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that there's nothing on there okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'd like to just give a huge disclaimer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm personally not a huge fan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think i'm like one in a million where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i almost never buy the fried chicken at </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> convenience stores </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> right because i don't really fried </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> chicken to begin with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> now this is the the standard just pepper </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and salt fried chicken but in lawson's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can get like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a ton of different variations they have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one that is like it's like uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like chinese sweet and sour one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's like black and i don't know why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it doesn't look good at all but it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] amazing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i i i don't know that just i've i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> never tried it but it just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it just because it's it's a it's a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> literal black chicken </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and it looks like someone it looks it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like someone took a chicken and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just dunked it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in um squid oil that's what it looks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like what i think we should do is we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> should cut up three pieces </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you should trade pieces okay we should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we should trade </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> like the family one has almost left the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> puddle </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's you this is actually like kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm gonna eat it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you look you can tell this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> family mart chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's the oh it's like compared </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to the seven chicken this one ain't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this one this one can't be white because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's gonna stain the white one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's gonna go straight it's gonna go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> straight through so i'm gonna i'm gonna </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it is very fatty and very greasy like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like there's no breast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> um you know what i mean it's it's not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously if you know i'm in the middle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of nowhere i mean i'm in a hokkaido </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i want a beer and a fried chicken it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going to do the job </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but when there's lawsons and and you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> again i will happily take this over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> fried chicken to begin with yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay my problem with family mart fried </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> chicken is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it tastes like death you know sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you're eating and you realize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> wait a minute i'm eating a dead animal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> right now that is what family mart </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> chicken tastes like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it feels like they inject it with stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel like that's a yeah let's try a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 7-eleven one there shall we okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay this is this which one's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 7-eleven uh it'll be this one this color </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there's this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> slightly orange one yeah now it's pretty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the reason the reason i stand 7-eleven </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the reason </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's my favorite one it's close to that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> fried chicken this one's also quite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> fatty though it's fatty enough where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's less than the family art chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the perfect amount you know you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know when you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know when you want a beer and you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just want to eat something healthy this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is the perfect amount of oil </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and unhealthiness that doesn't make you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel like you're eating death it it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> still makes you feel like you're eating </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like something that you shouldn't be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> enjoying every day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's a bit of a it's i have to say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think in terms of the seasoning they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> season the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out of all of them this like with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lawson's they have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> way more choice in the chicken seasoning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like there's like the spicy i i do think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is gonna be the weakest one out of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like that the choices that lawsons have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm not trying to like you know about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> myself in the corner but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm just saying like out of everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 7-eleven just just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just does the basic fried chicken the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> best has the best seasoning doesn't it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't need anything fancy no spicy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chicken </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just pure here's what fried chicken </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> should taste like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> salt and pepper seasoned perfectly the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right amount of oil </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is the best fried chicken yeah let's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> try this lawson one because i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> realized immediately that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of the thickness of chicken </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is probably the thickest it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> thick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah this is like you're getting good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chocolate that's like a problem this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> a proper amount of here's the chicken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and here's the that could be a candy do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's so good yeah exactly it honestly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> tastes like a tandy as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for the right amount of juicy actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what i think that might be my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> favorite right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it tastes more like a chicken tender </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than a like a breast </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that's like the closest to kfc for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> something yeah i mean i agree </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think it needs more seasoning yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what i mean like take that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chicken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> right and actually put like a [ __ ] ton </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of seasoning on it make it spicy because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's the best that's that's the reason </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i stand the 7-eleven chicken </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it is it is like i'd say there's less </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than the 7-eleven chicken but the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 7-eleven chicken just has the best </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> seasoning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and why why do we eat fried chicken it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because of the seasoning like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know 11 secret herbs and spices like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> imagine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> imagine buying kfc chicken and then all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the skins off no one would want to eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that [ __ ] let's be honest that's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you eat it because of the skin because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the seasoning on the fried chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so i will go you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> let's write let's write one two three i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would say i personally would say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lawson seven eleven family mart i'd say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the same for me personally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'd say i'd say you saw a little more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> bias yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'd say seven eleven lawsons family mart </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> right at the bottom we can all agree </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that family martial </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> in this case that's the third opinion in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the room joey i suppose you've put it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> over the edge for lawson's right i would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> i would have to give a point to lawson </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> just because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the seasoning for 7-eleven is good but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> i think it's like too much seasoning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah uh they also do nuggets now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> these are the basic kind which i i you'd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> never catch me finding i just i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i want a spice there's like there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> hot version and i think there's a cheese </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> version </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i don't [ __ ] with the cheese </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> versions because it's like injected </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> cheese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't trust that cheese should be on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> top it should never be injected right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> there's some things that should be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> injected and cheese isn't one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> of the vaccines check yeah medicine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> medicine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> check and uh these have been microwaved </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because we've heated them up but uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah they don't look too great not gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> lie you guys want to try and nugget </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the color on this chicken is kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tragic looking honestly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i did eat one before recording something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this looks actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is the most depressing chicken you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> know what this looks like this looks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like this is like frozen yeah yellow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is it was once frozen and i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> defrosted it it's it's like it does it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lacks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> any kind of color that makes it look </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that wouldn't make it look oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> oh no that ain't good no they had to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> slime down walson </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> 711 family mod and then whatever the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] i just said okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that was worse than the family mart </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> chicken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i said the family mart chicken tastes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like death oh my god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that was this looks this tastes right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> out the freezer yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my god you know what this tastes like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> okay this look at that look at that this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> for real tastes like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the skin is like dying to get off it </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> kombini's are great because sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you buy something and it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> way better than you expect to buy at a </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> of like cheap sake usually has like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> harsh honestly it's less i think it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> less offensive than the one that chris </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> right here so not a liar doesn't look </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> appetizing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i have also never seen that before have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you ever seen this before it's it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> honestly it [ __ ] slaps it tastes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> great vertically to the camera okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i can't show it vertically because it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> got it's got sources in it but look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what happens is that it comes it comes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with two compartments right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay there we go juices the juices </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a lot of juices in here so what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happens is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's basically just grilled like what is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it grilled </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> beef beef strips uh in whatever juices </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cook it in and it comes with two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> compartments ah that is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that is that is hot it comes with the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> rice compartment that's a common mistake </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that people comes with the rice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> compartment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> or you can just dump it all on or you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> can just take a piece at a time yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> exactly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever works best you've got two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> compartments you can eat it however you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like i like to dump it i'll give it a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the reason the reason why they split it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> up is the spices on this [ __ ] as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah some uh some like heat this is just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> an excuse for us to uh film our eating </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> our dinners right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you know we're not gonna lie you can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> tell this is like super cheap because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this beef is half just fat look at that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like that is you know the reason though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> why they started it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the good part you know the reason </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why they split it up into two layers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so that the rice doesn't soak up yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah you wouldn't want the rice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being sorry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> come on okay honestly if you come to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> japan try the beef bowls because the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> beef bowls are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> by far my favorite like 7-eleven or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever convener you decide well you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can go to the top three beef ball chains </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> oh yeah you could just go outside </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they'll probably be at matsuyazukiya or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's my favorite cheap japanese dish </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> throw some of that on my plate </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah so do you get this often i get this </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> without a car you're basically [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like you can't walk in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know into a snowstorm to like go to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the next town financial advisor </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> not even my financial advisor could save </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me but so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the only thing they had around where i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> was staying was a family mart </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh that's why you're a family master so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> throughout that entire month i i would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> want to say minimum </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two meals a day every day for a month </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was family mart yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know what i felt like i wanted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to die by the end of it </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i highly regret that i did that because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i feel so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] unhealthy right now because the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing is when you come </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you come to japan for the first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> time and you see how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just how much choice of meals there are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> in every convenience stores especially </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> coming from england where the only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> choice i have is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the tesco's meal deal don't don't come </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> on don't don't talk ill of like the best </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> thing that we have about our country </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but there's in terms of like let's say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> packageable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> lunches or meals that you can get away </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> pastries that's kind of about it really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we do have something you've got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> sandwiches you got i think we all have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the problem with the uk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> stuff that you can like kind of take </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> quickly it's all in like the same genre </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and the food the thing like it doesn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's no there's no variety yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and the thing is only say only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like the big super mega stores have the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hot food like the fresh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chicken food is good like sometimes you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you go to like sainsbury's it's the big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> sainsburys and they have like the hot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> rotisserie chickens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> those actually slap but tesco's have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the sausage like yeah like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> foot long sausage that you can eat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] amazing but those but those are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> limited to like the really really big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stores </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um so the good thing about convenience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stores is that all this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like everything you see is basically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> homogeneous throughout basically every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> convenience store you can find </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there are some that are bigger that have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even more choice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of what you can buy but we are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> showcasing stuff that you can buy in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically every convenience store you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> can get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> living here it's sort of like you view </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> convenience food almost like mcdonald's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my mind like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it starts to have like a almost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not a mcdonald's characteristic to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taste of how you know it's not like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not all fresh it doesn't all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> taste quite like something's been a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> little too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> healthy as they package it up yeah right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean there are definitely some healthy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> things like there's some decent salads </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's some stuff like that and like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> after the gym i think we always uh we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> always just get like this just chicken </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> breasts salad chicken yeah so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so they have literally you have one of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> them right do i have a chicken breast </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> joey might have one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> did you did you buy a chicken breast the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> only thing i have is this sauce </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just a sausage just it's called </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's from johnsonville amazing name </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it's an american brand i think so and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can just rip it open and you start </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> eating it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> one sausage what what what i do have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's not a chicken breast </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something similar like that but but they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> literally have uh this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this this is a a salad chicken ball i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know what a salad chicken bar is </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> like a salad chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nuggets imagine literally a chicken </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> saturation it looks beautiful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like way too yellow for it to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> real yeah i like the egg </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the problem i have with this sandwich </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> fully mashed okay what i don't like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about this one and why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i've never bought this one is because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> this egg looks like runny yolk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it looks like the [ __ ] that comes out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your nose it's like runny egg yolk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely a lot more of like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> mayonnaise flavor in this yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> is i've already got one strawberry as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> honestly one thing that the sandwiches </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> are guilty of doing here is that they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> loaded in the front they look like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're filled and then you take one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> bite and you realize there's nothing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> they click bait </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah it's literally it's it's literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the walker's crisp yeah where or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you bite into it and most of it's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> air and i found that family mart does </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that the worst </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> family members has this sandwich right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that i used to get from valuable which </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> it looks like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bursting it can't wait to get out and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you take one bite and then you realize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it goes from like this like it's so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> thin let's give this a shot all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that's not a sandwich honestly it's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> a cake that's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's a dessert it's a strawberry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> shortcake that's </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> two two bread </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> two breads uh slices and calling it a </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> exactly the same strawberry shortcake </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> blew my mind because the the cake part </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is so fluffy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and the cream the whipped cream japanese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whipped cream is the best i've tasted </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the world i will i will stand by that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that's why japanese sweets taste so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> good a lot of it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but talking what do we use so what are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> we trying next lads </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we try like the more like savory snacks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe like the fish and the meats next </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> do you guys have any of those </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> sure so gentlemen as you know one of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> um well-known food items </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was trying to say but one of the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> well-known food items from japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is of course the jelly doughnuts aka </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you took me back the onigiri uh which if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you've seen if you've basically watched </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> any anime you've seen characters eating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> onigiri </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the rice balls this is this is basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the closest we get to an actual japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sandwich because it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rice sandwich basically right this is a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wait wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh okay oh oh oh my god i did not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> where's the seaweed where is the seaweed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the best part it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like the hot dog wrapper right yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the best part of a hot dog is the crunch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah right what is that it is a grilled </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> salmon onigiri </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh i have a grilled salmon one as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> okay we want also a grilled salmon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> salmon onigiri so yeah as you know me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and gan actually ate onigiri and this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actually one of them that i was eating </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> quite delicious as much as i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> complaining uh show business honestly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that is that is my favorite onigiri to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> get so from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lawsons i've never seen that one from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean from all of the places gone now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lawson's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like every good big brain company has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their own </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> product line specifically for onigiri </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they have the bit the basic [ __ ] on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> igiri yeah it's like 100 yen now this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] is like 190 yen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh that's a premium shirt you can't even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> see it that's how premium is it honestly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i i will stan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> um 7-eleven hot foods and fried foods </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't i don't understand it's honest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the most depressing looking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> onigiri i've ever seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm sorry it's it's like it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> someone put the condom on wrong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they put the condom on sideways instead </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> of on top now let me gentlemen let me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> show you what a good honey giri </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay actually it looks the same it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just it's just a bigger condom no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> no that's how it should look look at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that that's just the bigger condom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a beautiful honestly it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> beautiful because every bite you get you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> get a bit of seaweed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think here's the thing that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> differentiates between a good on your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gear and bad noise </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the rice to insides ratio 100 100 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yes if there's like if the first bite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you bite into an onigiri and you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> immediately hit the inside that's a good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> one yeah too fair a lot of the cheap </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ones or even sometimes like if they've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> just filled it not not quite right that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one time you do just get like four bites </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in you're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where is the [ __ ] where's the feeling uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i gotta ask </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> do you boys actually eat on a gear </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anymore yes yeah i still do you do i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> gave up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i do whenever i need to quit when i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whenever i literally need a quick snap </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i'm sure i'm just never in the mood </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> for a block of carbs you know what i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that's the problem and like there's not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> enough filling i'd rather wait and yet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you get the [ __ ] microwavable gu dogs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's if like i want to [ __ ] i want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to pig out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i haven't had a goo dog in a long time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> just like that she's dreadful </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> honestly because sometimes sometimes i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> miss my lunch and i have like a filming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i just need to fill up my stomach as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quickly as possible and that's when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just like one onigiri that lasts me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> until dinner and it does everything it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> needs to do what is your favorite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> filling of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> year so there's different flavors that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you could have in it normally all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fish there is sometimes grilled chicken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but honestly i'm not a fan of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't get it like cause the good part </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> about the fish one is that normally like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seeps into the rest of the area yeah the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> chicken one just is a ball </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i'd have to say the tuna it's probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> true is my favorite as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i actually you are holding my favorite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> one which is the salmon belly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's really really good premium uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> salmon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh i in terms of the chicken how do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> guys feel about the onigiri where it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't really have a filling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just kind of like the grilled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> grilled rice with grilled chicken or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever i used to eat those when i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> little </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but as i got older i was like nah i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> want i want something more like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah it feels like satisfying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah fake meal i don't know why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> um but yeah i don't know why when i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first visited japan i [ __ ] all i ate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like onigiri i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone's like because you're like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> my god i'm in japan i'm gonna eat the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese things i can't get this at home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can get a sandwich at home yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then when i started living here i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yo the sandwiches are pretty [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bomber have you tried these sandwiches </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're like nearly the same price </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what am i doing man and sandwich is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> easier to eat because sometimes onigiri </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> falls apart if you like if you're you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know sometimes you're going to write </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> a bad idea yeah like i didn't give to me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i never eat onigiri as a meal like if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm having a lunch i never pick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> onigiri as the lunch onigiri is a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> convenience if i need to stuff myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and have it not taste awful i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> realized </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's like no way for us to like share </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> to be fair i've never tried the family </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> mart branded i have never tried the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> seven onigiri </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i've had this one before and it's good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i'm just gonna do a bite just to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> prove that it's good again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh look at that immediately wait like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> okay how many how deep would i have to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> bite draken to get the filling jay </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> okay i don't like crab sticks because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> don't mind like crabs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> crab is one food that i think just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't taste good processed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and crab sticks just feel like they they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> feel like such </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> processed foods it's like canned lobster </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you want canned lobster no one wants </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like you gotta you gotta have with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the crab sticks </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> the ones that are like on the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> grill with like the things oh yeah but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that's [ __ ] that [ __ ] is fire yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's not i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i i don't think it's the crab that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tastes good it's the fact that it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> grilled and it's got the sauce on it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and i'd rather have another it can be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> good i think it's really good yeah this </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> i'm not a fan i'm starting on a fan bite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah there's a there's a seed inside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah watch out for the seed oh that's so </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> like what's the what's the most sour </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing you can normally get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in like south africa it's way it's way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> more south you know that one video we </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_04> wet samba </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like actually like wet but they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they make it for old people who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> break it down that's wholesome okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> let's give it a shot okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> what the [ __ ] whoa that's weird </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so mochi rice is actually different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from regular rice mochi rice is a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> softer and a lot more like squishier </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so you get something like this yeah it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> a little it's a little whack ain't it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh that's so bizarre yeah i don't like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> okay so two you know what it is it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's moist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to explain what to explain laughing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what's funny marlene </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to to explain what i just experienced so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as we said this this has the perfect </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> texture </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like a good cookie and like my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my experience has told me that this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> good i'm going to bite into this and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's going to taste sweet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and what i tasted was a salted cracker </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with a moist cookie texture </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that isn't bad though i i'd eat it like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i wouldn't i wouldn't search for it but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i'd eat it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that that was that texture and taste </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just doesn't belong together i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know some something about that whatever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've kind of been conditioned right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah maybe it's not because i i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i taste it and it tastes good and i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the texture and the texture feels good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but together it just does not synergize </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like anti-umami man it's like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> plus and a minus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kabuki yoyo these ones i i buy these i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but when you have like four or five you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> start to feel sick oh yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> so like uh what's the what's the word to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> describe everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> these are really good yeah so there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like how would you describe the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> texture it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cavernous it's like a it's like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> thing from fantastic forwards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know what it is that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> amazing for like one or two bites but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really like sickly after like three you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> know what i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i don't know man i could i could just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe maybe it's just me it's probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just yeah yeah yeah it's not bad though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these are my favorite types of sandbags </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i think so this tastes exactly the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as what we just had but this is the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> texture i imagine that tastes having </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like it's a nice salty cracker </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just with a bit more air </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in between or like it's it's it's fatter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than the cracker but it's lighter than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the cracker yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's kind of like eating like cotton </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> foam </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> just like flavored right so what are we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> having from yours okay so i've never </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> actually seen this before </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but i know this brand baby start army uh </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> um what is candy candy i have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> an ancient video on my channel from like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> six years ago where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i bought like a box of those candy right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i said to myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> would i be able </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i emptied like 30 of these into a bowl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i crushed them into a powder and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then i mixed it with the carbonated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to see if it would go back into a ramen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spoilers it doesn't go back into ramen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> um i've only ever had the drink a few </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> times it's quite nice but i mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's basically what how do you how would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you describe ramen it's basically like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> japanese uh lemonade right yeah japanese </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> wow yeah i love these is this this you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> love this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i do i grew up with this [ __ ] yeah okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i was like eating a kid </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i i i eat this and i'm like i taste a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> childhood i never had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no wonder you look like 10 gone because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you're [ __ ] eating kids [ __ ] all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably what were you drinking like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> breast milk still all the time like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> what's going on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i would secretly i would eat this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what connor has the right there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> chocolate babies i love these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> these are great these are like these are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> terrible though because like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you think you're not eating a lot of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> chocolate because it's so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dense i i look at this and i thought it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> was going to be a tic tac </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that right the first time i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> tried it i thought it was a picture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it looks like a tic tac and you bite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> into it and it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like chocolate it's pure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chocolate chocolate as well though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the most inoffensive chocolate that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the good chocolate you would eat as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah literally just tic tac chocolate </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> version yeah pretty much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it makes chocolate way too easy to eat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because because you just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the supermarkets have the big versions </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and if i get them it's almost </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> impossible </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like it's like eating sprinklings </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and oh that's that's my childhood right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there like this big as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tiny that's my childhood very nice milk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> chocolate </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's good the other thing though that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is my childhood </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is these things um i bought i hate these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> these suck </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have you tried these no oh yeah you can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> try it okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so these they're literally called umaibo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which means tasty stick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's literally what it's called okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's basically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh god how do you even explain it so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically there's like these have been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> around since like the [ __ ] 20s like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> these are ancient </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're 10 yen each all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] nothing but feel how light that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> is these are the spacers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> these are the space raiders of japan i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think this this is because this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> packaged air </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah if you throw this high enough into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the air it'll just go off this has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> no weight at all what's the actual </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> weight written on the package </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> uh oh dozens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> six grams six grams </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i guarantee i'm pretty sure most of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the grams is the packaging </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is this the [ __ ] packaging i'm </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> about melty kiss is one of those </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh brands in japan that is always </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seasonal they always have a seasonal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> flavor of melty kiss you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can tell what time period you are in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you go to a supermarket or a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> company and you see what melody kisses </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> around and as the name suggests uh they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> melt pretty [ __ ] fast </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so i i really like it it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i like him it is just basically mochi we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have chocolate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just basically actually you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know what that's really good yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know what melty kiss you had i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think i had an awful like tasting one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is just chocolate this is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> good this is chocolate chips this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really rich chocolate it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> chocolate truffle right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> there's no mochi in this is that yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> does it think so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> there might be a mochi variant oh i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thought it was mochi so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i tasted that i didn't taste any more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and thank god they're all individually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wrapped so we can enjoy those later yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um i also have this is my channel that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the mod </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what is this oh my god i can't read </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] the phone come on you're nihongo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> josu you can do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you're just trying to try to figure it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> out bro it's the fancy fonts [ __ ] me up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in japanese so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's cute so it's separated into cute </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> little packages oh cute </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so that's like perfect for dates yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah man you and your gf </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rocking up okay how do you feel about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> mochi um mid-tier </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it depends it depends on the time like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> mochi ice cream and like regular mochi </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and like sweet small cheese is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> completely different in my opinion so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what is what is mochi again </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mochi is just rice it's rice pudding </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so mochi is just rice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> so basically they grab uh mochi rice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is a specific type of rice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and they just [ __ ] mash it with a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> hammer until it turns into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mochi that's good it's very chewy it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just good shape </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's clean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> how i always feel about mochi is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just very inoffensive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i would never not eat mochi but i would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> never go out my way to get it but you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> know like a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> old people die from choking on mochi i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can see why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so when you eat mochi make sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like yeah make sure you like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> properly chew this [ __ ] otherwise it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> will get stuck in your throat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm sorry i was laughing because i saw </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one of gaunt's item i keep forgetting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's called this it's called the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> chocolate pound cake </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_04> i never thought about that i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah pound cake of course </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> wow that's crazy it's it's like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> crunchiness of a biscuit and a kitkat </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_01> buy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a melon and it's god damn you know how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> you bite into a melon and it just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it feels like clean because it feels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you're eating like a really watery </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fruit yeah yeah for some reason that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a completely dry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> snack that we just had but it felt </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> watery </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> we don't need to try that it's called </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> sugar butter sand tree the [ __ ] is that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it just looks like a custard it's a 7-11 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brand too yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] that i have um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> wasabi sticks it looks like is that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> cheese and what's happening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh that's jagariko which is like a brand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of like uh savory steaks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i guess this is like wasabi show you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> flavor right dude do you like wasabi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> snacks no i do not get them i like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wasabi like beans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the wasabi seed like flavored things i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> forgot what they were called but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i know we talked about peanut butter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah there's there's like there's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> beans that are covered in wasabi yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] with those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean let me smell this for me wasabi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just doesn't feel like something that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> should be snacked on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's basic as [ __ ] did you chase </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> anything i don't say something i taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> the wasabi yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i barely oh a little bit tiny bit oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah there it is because when we eat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> something wasabi flavor we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> used to the whole like kickback right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but this is just like literally just a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hint of wasabi flavor honestly it's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> too overpowering i like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] yes i literally were just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on wasabi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> snacks literally five minutes ago and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's because the wasabi normally what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happens with wasabi snacks is that it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> overpowers whatever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you think like i can probably taste the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> soy sauce on that as well yeah and like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i i ate that and i was like i can't even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> taste the wasabi but then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you get that aftertaste you literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just did like the kombucha girl like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like no wasabi actually these are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty good yeah because you know you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know when you have bad sushi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you you kind of like try to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> overpower it with wasabi just to get rid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of the taste like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what who does that do you do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes sometimes really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but like i don't find myself in a bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sushi restaurant i know a good one no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> no no no joey </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> was louis he didn't go into a bed again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you go to some sushi restaurants </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially with friends from abroad and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you see them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like put a little bit of soy sauce and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then [ __ ] wasabi yeah and then it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like 90 wasabi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 10 soy sauce and they just basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just dipped the entire season </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] drown it in and i don't know how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> they can taste the fish that's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> incorrect way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to eat sushi yeah finally okay and i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like this is the perfect kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> balance </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> of like how how a good sushi should </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taste like actually i really like those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> damn what's the gigger video coming on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> about these you went on a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but final thing we have is matcha </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> classic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we could have had about a bazillion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> match items we wanted to i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> honestly i think matcha is my favorite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> weren't you the guy like sit like seven </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> months ago thought match was overrated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't think so no i don't think that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> was gone or someone else goes on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i think that's like that shows overhyped </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i feel like i feel that's like okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> so you're you are the guy who think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> matches i think matcha is awesome i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the two dichotomies with matcha </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> though it's either you think it's </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_00> one one question have you ever had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> matcha soft served </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because matcha soft serve is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> single-handedly changed my opinion of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> matcha because after i had much a soft </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> don't even know what the flavor of it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just gohan this your flavor but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically you put it on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a bed of rice and it basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's good on rice that's all it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> bro you're kidding me that's all that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> smells like seaweed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a seaweed it's a seaweed paste but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you would give this to like kids </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i think i inhaled an x amount of salt </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> just from being near there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well that's the thing because it's so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> salty you put that on a better rice and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it mellows it out perfectly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> this is uh this is i'm not gonna eat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that i'm not eating now this is this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> jagger </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> now </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> oh too much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what that tastes like it tastes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you ate </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> downed with like a hot chocolate if i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's what that tastes like get double </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> egg sandwich family mods better </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if only they could join forces yeah i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> would agree if only they could join </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> forces </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like runny egg sandwiches should never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> be a thing it's not ronnie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it it does i don't know about it it's a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> paste it's mashed up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's the collab we want to happen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like egg paste shouldn't be a thing it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> not paste it's just it's mashed down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i wanna like i wanna taste the eggs i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> want the texture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't need it i don't need it i need </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it like even i prefer it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even even scrambled egg has a texture </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this was like scrambled egg that was put </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into a paste </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it is it is i like it it's like egg </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> flavored gluten </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> to me the egg is like they're both very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> strong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but to me the tuna is just so much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> better the tuna is hands down better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like why would i want it and also </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> there's supermarkets that like aren't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any of those that get like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sandwiches as well and the tuna always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tastes like the family </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> one for some reason yeah yeah for some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> reason i feel the awesome one they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually took like the canned tuna and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> juice yeah it's good [ __ ] yeah good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] chicken i feel like the lawsons </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one the tuna sandwiches is better </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely better the egg sandwiches </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> i don't eat that many sandwiches from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the combinies so i don't really have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> too much of a strong opinion what about </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> you don't have to okay no i i got it the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> initial taste tastes [ __ ] awful </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all right and then the aftertaste kicks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in and i'm like this tastes like uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what does taste the aftertaste gives me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the same kind of taste i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when when you're cooking like a brownie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something and you have like cooking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chocolate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you took you're cooking like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chocolate pudding and then as a kid you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> have a bit of the chocolate you know you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> see it doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i wasn't listening i was just enjoying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> connor looking dead over there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it doesn't taste like that you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> chatting [ __ ] but all in all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'd have to say you can get like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you're a woman </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're a winner if you're in japan is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> not even all of that this is not even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a corner of what you can get at a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> company [ __ ] the best </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> tasting thing what was the worst tasting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> thing oh god okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> because i'm having a hard time deciding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> between this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and this oh no honestly the crab cake </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the crab cake oh the crab cake was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty cool no actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's it's this for me this is this has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the worst </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> aftertaste and crab cake i still have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the aftertaste of this in my mouth right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> after eating all that [ __ ] was gross </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah chica i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i i grew up i grew up with chico and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a reason why i stopped eating it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's literally right it literally smells </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like vomit yeah it ain't rich </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that was probably the worst flavored one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was the worst thing but yeah again </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like this is nowhere near the variety </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can get at a convenience store </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's so many more snacks i mean you </SPEAKER_05>
