<SPEAKER_07> anymore yeah after that point it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah you're probably just like 23 24 I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> feel in my head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's until your body starts like giving </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> up this is just 30s copium I'm like I'm </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_06> um so I was at I was at status and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Emily's house and he asked if I wanted </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some anything to drink I was like yeah </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_02> pull myself some water he's like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you no ice really I said yeah I like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it I like it less when it's cold so on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my tickets that I don't like cold water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that I think the room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> temperature water is tastier is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's easier to drink that's my take for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the year well I've got no trash days 20 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 20. when we're starting off with a bag </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been holding this back because we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> switched to the two days ago and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really wanted to be like is this weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like this is not weird right we're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna be like in trash today's 2024 and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're gonna be like you know what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> smiling overrated kind of I kind of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I just I just had this conversation and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> he made me feel like I was weird for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> liking water that was from straight from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the [ __ ] tap just just room Ash </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> temperature I just want to be able to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drink it right then like if it's too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cold my mouth gets too cold and then my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> my esophagus feels like it's freezing I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just I just want to have the drink right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> away sounds like a skill issue to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe it is easier is there a reason you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just okay yeah since since we're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> declaring war against cold Wars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cold water do I hate it when I'm in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> America and they give me a cup of water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it is 99 ice and one drop of water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I hate that okay so like are you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just like a no-wise person no matter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what I'm like a one two Cube guy Max </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I wanted to like lightly cool the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> water like I don't want to I don't want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that [ __ ] to be ice cold like lightly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> cool I just wanna I want the illusion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that I'm calling it without cooling it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is it possible that I just have a take </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the same as you because I'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no give me all the [ __ ] nice just if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're good if you're gonna put this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> feels like an AI generated conversation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like a trash taste if you're gonna put </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> ice cube in it just [ __ ] fill that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] up I don't want one or two I want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like a high glass or nothing man and on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brand I'm just in a position where I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of just like listen listen give me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> both bro this is not that I don't both </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is fine I'm not like I'm dying on this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hill it's like I just did it and I got I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> felt attacked the Titus was like how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> dare you yeah I have ice three fat I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't care that much it's just my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Southeast Asian blood like it's when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> when I when I because when we have eyes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is that we need to fill that [ __ ] up to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the brim because the ice melts so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> quickly so I I've just got on your </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> customers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> basically right basically okay here's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> here's something even more outrageous </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that Thailand does not Regis </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> egregious sorry I I [ __ ] up the words </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> all the time we have like 900 clubs okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you talk about putting ice cubes in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> water right so here's what they do in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time I know you're gonna tell me now I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know I already hate it they uh serve you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the big I know I know and then they go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with ice with ice in it and they give </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you ice and some place and some places </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> have the ice already in the cup where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you pour the beer and it's why it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because because of the weather okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because of the weather yeah because I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to get to the bottom of this yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's Thai beer made or I guess like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brewed in a way where it's better cold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or is it just like any other beer where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you put it with some [ __ ] ice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> cubes and it's like what the [ __ ] it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of like any other pair honestly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna have to be like no that's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> allowed I was gonna give it the benefit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the doubt if it was like brewed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> differently where it's like oh it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually better surf chilled but like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> okay but here's the real question would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you what what which of the two evils </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would you prefer a warm bear or a beer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with ice in it because you you ain't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> getting you ain't getting a cold beer in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Thailand that like maintains itself okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so you have two options you have two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> options either you drink a warm beer or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you drink a beer with ice in it and and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I shoot I like you and I'm gonna be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> honest I choose the Ice Cube man I that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to me having a refreshing feeling with a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> beer is the Lesser or two evil hold up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would you put ice cubes in a glass of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because this is the same kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> question right you're you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> compromising the drink obviously with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff like you know whiskey there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's arguments there and some people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say the water helps the flavor but with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beer that's flat out just no no no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you do not the you don't put water to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fair I've never had warm beard nor beer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with ice probably yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but when you're at college or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right like you just forgot to put in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fridge you're like all right well I'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just take a warm beer I mean is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wall it's like room temp yeah okay room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> temp is a bit different to warm well I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean how warm can it be I mean yeah room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> temperature in Thailand it's very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> different from room temperature </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> you have a barbecue in the summer and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gets you know the beer gets really warm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you ran out of ice in the cooler </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like all right well you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's whatever warm beer is fine but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> putting water in beer and Ice having </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like dilute all of the beer that's water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down beer is a little bit nasty yeah as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if like Coors Light wasn't drinkable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like it wasn't like a [ __ ] what's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> word </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um it's hard enough to drink some beers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> why the [ __ ] would you want to put water </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in it it's it's okay yeah I like I'm not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna defend this obviously because I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> both are like awful in my mind but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my Stratton Thailand is like if you if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have let's say a glass full of ice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for example cools it down very quickly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so it doesn't get like too watered down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you and since there's like less </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> volume you can drink it more quickly as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> opposed to like letting it get watered </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down I choose that evil over having warm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> beer because there's just something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about I'm not like a fan of like warm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> water in general unless it's kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I'm Ill or something I love warm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> water it's like because it reminds me of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> tea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot more water is like water down tea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I have occasionally just drank in warm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> water yeah just like [ __ ] it I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wanna I want the feeling of tea without </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> having to make a tea I don't know why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not too sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it's close enough it's close enough I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> not sure about that one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have dog [ __ ] takes all right this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my dog should take of the Year why don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they just okay what I don't understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right is that okay obviously it's hot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> outside right yeah and you want to keep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the beer as cold as you possibly can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so why don't they just do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing where they do in Japan where they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just shove the the beer like glass yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in like a freezer or something so that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like chilled out yeah I thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about it then immediately pull the beer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then if it starts to get warm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] naked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in Australia we don't have to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> worry about it's hot as [ __ ] in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Australia by the glass shredders in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> go-to yeah just use the glass stripe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's just like a lot of like fridge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> space though you know that that's always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> storing all those ice cubes I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> wondering how the like Japan is like so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> optimized with space because in most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> places like having like a fridge full of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> glasses that's just like that's just a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fridge that you're basically like not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> using for food or well I guess all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> let's just let's break down the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> logistics here okay okay you you let's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say you're cooling the drinks obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they stay cooler for longer that's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> benefit yeah uh you probably can't store </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all of your drinks in a cooler though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right like you probably don't have a big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enough thing to put all the drinks if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're a business selling drinks all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over maybe the glass is cool quick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enough where you could just shove them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in because it's you know they fill up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with ice yeah they don't take up that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much room so this maybe you can it can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> work I don't know you can stack drinks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right outside like ages I feel like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know this this is like a weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> complex maybe I feel like the bigger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> problem is is that if you if you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> giving glasses out to everyone right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if you give a bottle you sell it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's done yeah you don't have to worry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about getting it back right if you said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you give a drink with a glass you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> have to get rid of the the glass that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you you know poured the beer out of and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then now you have to try and get the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beer glass back yeah and and also every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that also means everything's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> complicated my head every time you order </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a bit every time you order a new beer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you need a new cool glass with it right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I imagine most of it's cans as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> where's those bottles actually no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bottles or glass bottles so there's it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> uh especially if you go to like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> local kind of you know bars and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurants they don't really have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> beer on top like single beer isn't good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> enough that it like deserves to be on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> top I'm gonna say that how loud okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> um it's kind of like it's it's mostly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just in like glass bottles so I mean if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they were why don't they just shove the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> glass bottles in the freezer and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you can just drink straight out of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the freezer well you know in in a cool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> environment so that it's frozen down so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can just drink directly rather </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> than pouring it into a glass just drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it straight out of the bottle I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the problem is is that ice cubes are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> really [ __ ] easy to make uh yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they also take up space yeah but I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can you can make them pretty quickly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think maybe keeping glasses in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> fridge will take a while I think that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you can this solution is that making a a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] ton of ice cubes is easy yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that keeping glasses cooled and stuff is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> complicated it just doesn't seem like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> intuitive in any way yeah I agree I mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like it's probably something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's just that was that started and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> then they just kept doing yeah yeah they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> haven't thought I don't know I also I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know [ __ ] fridges are expensive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yep come on man what the [ __ ] come on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to me this is just like the equivalent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of being like Oh I'm gonna make some ice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> cubes so I'm gonna take some cold water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then boil it wait till it cools down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then turn it into ice cubes it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like kind of it's like two steps in one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when you can just go straight to the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> step </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I guess [ __ ] together either way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> man I'm not excited for beer in Thailand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's for sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna be like no Heist please </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> how do I say no ice sorry how do I say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no ice most places in uh Thailand speak </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> English so oh okay all right especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if like you're in Bangkok just be just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah just ask for no ice it's pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> well they give you a weird look if you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> say no eyes no I think most tour like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> most tourists go through this like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> conundrum when I go to Thailand they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like why are they so stupid bro German </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would [ __ ] drop dead dude </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it'd be like that you know the GIF of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Walter White falling to the ground yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when he's like with his mouth open it'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be there Germans when they go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Thailand and get offered a beer with ice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> need ice with every glass of water I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> think so yeah I think he refuses to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> drink like water or is very picky at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> least we're gonna get him on we'll get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> them on yeah I can grill out more about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this because I I felt like I felt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> attacked you know is that an American </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing you think dude yeah they [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> love it because they love it remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every single like uh restaurant or Diner </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything you go to you always get the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> giant [ __ ] like two liter cup like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plastic cup with a straw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not the ice it's not the big ice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> cubes either it's like cheese sliced ice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's that's that I sucks I kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of like it no no one like the saddest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> looking like the saddest looking thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is with the shaved ice I'm I'm a I'm an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> advocate of if it's like the shave like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> really small cubes it needs to be up to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the brim otherwise like when when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you when you have like the uh when you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have a glass and it's just like a little </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like one small layer of shaved ice yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that just it just looks so sad for me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> because I'm like that ice is doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> nothing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just don't use that ice because I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just if I like you know when you because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> a lot of the time you go to the soda </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> machine you do it and it's always that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> shitty ice and you're like oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know I kind of wanted to like not </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_02> goddamn bad here man I I couldn't help </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> myself but anyway it was uh Chris came </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to LA and I was really excited to see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what Chris thought about La yeah and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was pretty much what I thought I let </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Chris come and tell his thoughts about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> La I'm sure he'll go off on one what was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it like behind the scenes of the chess </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> boxing event yeah so it was uh it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> interesting because obviously I was um I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was staying at Ludwig's house a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the time I was kind of getting just I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just tagging along to a lot of stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whilst I was going to do other stuff and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um it seemed like it was kind of all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> working nicely and then Ludwig had to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just go from A to B and whatever and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was kind of just like hi yeah I'm here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll turn up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and it didn't really start to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> crazy until the weigh-in yeah and that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was that was kind of intense because you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just turn up to this giant 5 000 person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> stadium and there's just insane amounts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of stuff and you're like God damn like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is all being coordinated by well a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> streamer essentially like his team his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> team's amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was it was just absurd seeing all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that equipment all that gear and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really felt like oh [ __ ] like I'm I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like kind of watching like a like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> serious kind of broadcast almost like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this is I can't imagine it would look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and the weigh-in was fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and oh before that as well I had the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> interviews where they I don't know you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> saw the videos yeah so they had two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> hotel rooms adjacent to each other and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were both really [ __ ] tiny so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they did the interviews in the hallway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of a hotel room and I was sitting in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> room next door just talking to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Ludwig or whoever was there just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chatting away while they were getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interviewed and then they would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> constantly go like can you guys shut up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in there we can hear you really easily </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they did the interviews I saw Chris </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh said hi to him like all right you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> excited yeah the weigh-in everyone kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of uh was you could tell that a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fighters were like not really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> prepared to do like the whole I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know how to look serious or scary yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so kind of like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was really interesting uh some of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them you could tell they were like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna put on a show I'm gonna do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah dude the the ad was so kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it was like kind of faux tense like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone was kind of like we're all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> friends right we're gonna punch you the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> next time yeah yeah and uh it was just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of interesting seeing everyone kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> of like slowly interact with their </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> groups and kind of not talk and then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> some people were like not talking to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> other people because they were gonna </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> fight them and like uh I distinctly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> remember that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Chris said hi to his opponent yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh Chris's coach is insane uh if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> haven't seen any Clips he's like is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> there's a video of him basically beating </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> up a seven foot Korean man and he's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> five ten right and he beats him in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> kickboxing like a giant seven foot man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> right um it's an insane clip I'm Sean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> can play a clip right now it's it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] insane this man's a machine yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and he's like full-on like proper </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> fighter kind of mindset and Chris is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Chris right so uh Chris is talking to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> his opponent and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just standing there watching this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and Nick goes up to Chris he's like all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right Chris now that was the fight no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> talking to him now you've got to focus </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're gonna punch that guy don't be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> friendly with him </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you can see Christian like oh it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just weird seeing him like go like he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like you're gonna kill him you can't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> talk to him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but that was the first time we got to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> see like Chris's uh opponent really show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> up yeah because the point was scary oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he was pretty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he's a big guy so he wasn't he isn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like very well trained in boxing he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> done a lot of other martial arts and you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> can tell the guy's just been generally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fit yeah his whole life because you look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at a guy like that's the man that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the body of a man who has been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> exercising for a long time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the same you can see like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> twitch chat as a I wish I could have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seen the twitch chat I was like I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like dying laughing so he's not seeing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like a switcher because like you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Chris has Chris has a lot of fans </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone's cheering for Chris yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> his opponent comes on and everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right it was just like it was just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a collectively your rip </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> oh [ __ ] well can you see this man's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> packs and this man's back muscles you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh [ __ ] and then you realize you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh okay like when you when you see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> them both we saw them both like stand up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like oh so Chris had been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> training six months just to get like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> halfway to where this guy was before he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even started yeah it's like that's that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're about to witness some murder right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so that's where it was like kind of it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> having a lot of natural Fitness helps so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much Chris was and Chris was just trying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get rid of his like excess weight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and the way it was like oh this guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> beats Christian length uh an arm arm uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wingspan uh in height in weight uh Chris </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> only beats him in age </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so maybe that has something I don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um and so obviously uh you know Chris </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Chris didn't really seem that nervous </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> though Chris seemed pretty confident </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> about it I think Chris felt like he had </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> maybe because uh he'd seen the clip of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> his opponent getting knocked out like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> week earlier right right his opponent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> got knocked out in one punch a week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> earlier right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and I'm sure Madonna could play a bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um so you know I think it was like a bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> worried but also everyone's kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well you know maybe maybe Chris can do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well yeah how is he in the dressing room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beforehand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just kind of Chris just sitting there I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think he was trying to just focus he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't really like talking much he was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just kind of like doing it and then I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> went off to go and go to my seat and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> watch what were you doing the thing that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Chris does when he's concentrating where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he does the mouth thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you said that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I said in a video so so um yeah the day </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um so I I knew obviously all the stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that was going to happen I knew that the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> table was going to come from the sky and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I knew that uh Ludwig was gonna slap uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have a slap match with xqc at the end </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right so the day off it's like 10 A.M </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and um like months months prior to this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I told Ludwig I was like hey if you ever </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> need anything you want me to get slapped </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or whatever I'll do it back up so that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> morning of the Box saying it's like it's </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_05> the screen is like up here right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> directly up and every time uh they went </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to play chess initially it was broken </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like the board was yeah yeah right as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you saw on the live stream so it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like oh all right so I guess </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> just quiet for like two minutes in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boxing side we're like yeah it's so good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> front row tickets are amazing for boxing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you you see and hear all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> punches really clearly and dude you can </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> see their face when they're like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> struggling as well it's it's it's a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty [ __ ] fun experience as I say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> for my sadistic standpoint </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> so fun look at these look at these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> peasants yeah I know exactly exactly and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the smashboxing was pretty fun I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think it all went pretty well yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and then yeah uh I went to go and do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the walking thing for Chris uh I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> basically uh I told Chris before I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah you should um you should do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something when you go out you should do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like some funny a funny bit or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was like what why I was like well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know it's like a show like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> put on a show why not you know because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> uh it'll be clipped everywhere there'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be a lot of people watching and he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh okay so he comes back a day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> later he's like I've got an idea we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna throw candy into the crowd and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> was like why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what reason are we doing this so he was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like oh it's Christmas in it I was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all right fine it's your walk out let's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do it so we go out we have these candy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> buckets and I'm just trying to Hype him </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> up and hype the crowd up right and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whatever we walk out and that was really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fun and I just immediately go to my seat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm watching him and man it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> intense it was it was intense watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Chris I'm sure you you guys watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from Amazon oh yeah I was watching from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> home yeah yeah it was um the boxing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> started and it looked like Chris was not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doing great so I think it was like oh oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no oh no and then the chess happened </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> then Chris started winning and we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh my God yes Chris is crushing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is literally about to win and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the boxing happened again we're like all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right just Chris just survive and Chris </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't really getting in many punches </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right because she's kind of like dodging </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and just I I it felt like watching like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you know some take on a Dark Souls boss </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah he was just like dodging like he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was just like frames </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally he was just like how many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> iframes can I get out of this I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm seeing him like trying to win at the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> chest yeah and there's definitely like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it seemed like a he's way more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> experienced at least in some form of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Combat Sports right yeah you can tell </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> because he's constantly going in he </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> knows his reach and he's playing with it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> whereas Chris is a bit more defensive </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're kind of just trying to survive </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah he's spamming the roll buttons uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then yeah he threw massively yeah in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> chess yeah and it was like oh okay well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I guess he's lost cause he's not going </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to beat him in boxing yeah and he's not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going to beat him in chess now but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> somehow his opponent was even [ __ ] at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chess so it all worked out and Chris won </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the end but it was intense it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 40 minutes long I was like on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> edge of my seat the entire time oh no so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> same here like watching that [ __ ] live I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> was just like seeing like Chris kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like clutch at the end with the chair so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> he's almost [ __ ] screaming yeah it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was hype it was hype I think Chris was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bit disappointed that he didn't do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> better in boxing I'm sure again he'll </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> possible so that when I go up it looks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> really like [ __ ] extra and over the </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> right whatever it's just all autopilot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll just figure it out we'll just do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh I hope I did a good job I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know maybe the audience uh I saw a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of nice comments so I'm hoping that I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> did it went really well yeah and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a good match uh we slapped each other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone everyone kept saying that we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> were faking our slaps we were too Fair </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the last two slabs were pretty hard the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> first two were like yeah they were they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> were holding back yeah so we also didn't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I was at the mindset of like I'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually trying to injure him I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually want to hurt him like I just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to make it look hard yeah without </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually injuring him yeah I did give </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> him a little bit of a bruise on the last </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lap that I've gotten pretty good with uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he did ask me to go a lot harder so I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> did but I still didn't do like fully 100 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but also I don't know I feel like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't need that that's a bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> excessive feeling is that really gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> add to anything if I give him a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> concussion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think it needed to happen but I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think it all worked out and I I got my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> belt I didn't choke uh I think uh it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> it was uh you know he definitely wanted </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to get the time the clock closer yeah um </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> at some point so you wanted to get it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like I think very close he's a master at </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stalling for Content yeah um but I think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> he accidentally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think he actually tried to win yeah he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> might he might say he threw for Conte I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think he actually tried to win because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you watch back you can see him trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to press the clock again uh he just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't press it in time but then also we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also broke so many rules like I didn't I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> totally forgot you're not allowed to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> move a chess piece and then press the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> clock with the other hand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh but then also half of these matches </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> no one [ __ ] played the chess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> correctly anyway so some people just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like move to peace and didn't didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even yes the clock yeah Chris's opponent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> did it a few times yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um so I was like yeah got it got my dub </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got the uh got the belt oh now I was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happy boy dude man I I don't know if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've had this before but whenever you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> have like a massive serotonin rush like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> they showed me did he do it in like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one Fell Swoop you probably hit him you </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> he did like an accordion with the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Cucumber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I tried I copied exactly what he did and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just didn't work it just fell apart </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> was like what the [ __ ] how did he do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that so I copied him yeah it's there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like some magic especially like </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> choker gecko where she's like yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what he did that's what he did I copied </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it didn't work </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> chef but then copied that now I have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> three listings copy that I just have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> half a cucumber and then yeah uh I flew </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back we flew to San Francisco flew back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the same day and the next day I flew </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> back to Japan and uh man yeah it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> literally like one week of just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> back-to-back stuff and it was it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty fun I mean I got so much work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> done it was great I I like it when I can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do a trip like that where I just go away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for a week it's so much work done come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> back and done like I did the stream as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well where I reviewed cereal with Chris </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Ludwig yeah yeah and that was a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but yeah it was it was just great I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> mean getting it's really satisfying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> planning out a trip like that and just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> again back and then you're like oh nice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> all right that was like productive did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you help Chris uh like practice that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Chess at all yeah I'm wondering like how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> much he did practice that chess I helped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> him practice a tiny bit mainly because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we never really ended up just we just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't do it um he knew how to play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> beforehand though right yeah he knew how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to play he was okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah he said he was 800 I don't I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's cap </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> um he wouldn't tell me he's rating </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um I I I think he said he was 800 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because that's like the default rating I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think so it's like yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> guys I'm 800. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> 650 600 maybe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> um because he was like I'm gonna do the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> queen scan bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he wanted to do the Queen's Campbell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> okay like which is a chess opening uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and before I was kind of like I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well I mean I mean I guess it's fine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I I told him I was like I would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have just done the classic the E4 yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah just a [ __ ] moving like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> easy you're white he was playing white </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as well right so I was like you could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just play that but I was like honestly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've been playing this entire time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with Queen's Gambit me telling you to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> swap it now is not going to do you any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> favors just do it just don't blunder </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your queen and he's like and then he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kept saying it he kept saying the days </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> leading before as long as I just jump </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> under the queen I'm happy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what he kept saying I kept saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> as long as I don't blunder the queen I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> could literally see how tilted he was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> after he blundered that for you yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a there was a thing that wasn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> picked up on the cameras but after he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> did that the round like when the thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> ding went and it was next to boxing he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stood up looked at me and did this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was I was like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah it was yeah I mean made a more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> dramatic run yeah did a full content </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know I I knew that his opponent was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> terrible at chess so I was like honestly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't worry about it just play yeah how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bad could it go and then it nearly went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> extremely badly and then he literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let his opponent promote to a queen but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> apparently he didn't even know that was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> so he was one one move away so in chess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you move the pawn all the way to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> end of the board you can get a queen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and somehow Chris had thrown his </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Queen and then allowed him to get his </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Pawn One move away from promoting with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nothing defending it and again I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they both missed that and they both </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> missed it yeah and he he was one move </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> away at any point he could just got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> another queen and it probably would have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just ended the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um he just didn't do it yeah and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> later someone had said that apparently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he just didn't know that was a thing oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> my God so Chris Chris is fighting a man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who is like a pro in boxing and a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> toddler in chess so luckily it worked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> out for him geez yeah it was like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> really really impressive the event was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> insane the event was insane yeah it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like considering how many moving </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Parts like I have to like go down for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that kind of event to happen and he was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like talking about it for like ages as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> well dude just seeing all the staff </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_07> how can you see that stuff and not be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> like inspired to want to better your own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> stuff and push it further yeah it's kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> of like every time I do go to La for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Anime Expo or whatever and like you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to talk to a lot of these other creators </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it does like light a fire on you oh for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sure for sure yeah and then you come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> back to Japan you're like like what can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I do here so yeah we can't do anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah which is why I'm like man we should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just make our own we should do it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because like just seeing some of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the ideas and some of the [ __ ] they can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> get away with over there just kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh I wish I could do this in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well right yeah yeah because it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like the infrastructure is then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> easier just to you know get a be able to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> get a camera and just be able to like do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> exciting things it's uh you know I have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of problems with um La as as we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all like mentioned yeah of course uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we've all had our qualms with it but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's they they have like all of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> instructor there just to make [ __ ] down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and get you yeah I mean like you know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you want to hire out three guys and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> someone who knows how to live a live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> broadcast an audio guy who knows how to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get it all done it's like boom in L.A </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's easy but in Japan it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> impossible yeah yeah you know there are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese people who do who do it but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like they won't be nearly as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> flexible enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to do what we would need them to do and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also they would charge so goddamn much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> money where if you know it's it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> makes more sense at that point just if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're going to be doing it consistently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just make your own team yeah yeah get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all this stuff like when we did that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Sushi stream that was three RED cameras </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they were using to stream three Cinema </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> cameras to stream that insane for those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of you don't know each one is like 20 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> grand no no no there's more more than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> they're like they're like 30 to 40 I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> think but just just the the camera yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then you need to buy all the other </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] which adds up a lot it's a lot yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> the SSD is also red yeah you can't use </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> others they have their own proprietary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff which is kind of a that's a whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> link so patrons we know what we want for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Christmas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I did that uh I did a poker stream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> recently as well where I got invited to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> play poker with a bunch of jazz people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who I just only kind of briefly spoke to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> once and I kind of thought yeah this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> sounds intimidating just turning up to a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was a shogi building that they rented </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out to play poker cool um uh and it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> just they kind of brokenly messaged me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in English being like poker yes alcohol </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yes uh and then as I'm like going over </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there yeah they mentioned me being like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> poker no I'm like what what do you what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> but then I get there and they're like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah all good all good what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just message me in Japanese and I'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Google translate them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I met these people on a stream and one </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> great poker's the fun part you know have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you ever played poker Cherry yeah I play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> poker times I played it in uh Hokkaido </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> actually like uh earlier this year yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was up there with a few of my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> friends </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and super fun and again it's like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> whole buy-in thing and then when you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> finish with it you get like kind of I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guess like a credit type of thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> um the way you can use it again to buy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> yourself back in right if you go back to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> that store for example </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um but yeah it's like you just play with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> a bunch of like random Japanese people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are just like having drinks and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like hanging out it's a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> conversation game yeah it is it's a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of time to talk perfect perfect like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> boys night just because it's like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the perfect mix between okay we're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> playing a game but also enough time to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like chill out with the boys and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just have a conversation for sure yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anything like that I remember like when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we went to Vegas we tried going to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the poker tables in Vegas and then yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we saw the buy-ins there and we're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> there's like a minimum 100 bucks a hand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and so that's a minimum right so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you need least a few thousand even sit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> down and then I when we walked past it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> we just saw like dude people looked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> intense yeah and like people were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shouting and stuff like that situations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's a lot of those people are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> gambling with like their entire life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like War yeah uh and so I was like man I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't think this is the vibe yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't think this should be fine yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> think I I wanted to have a little fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> poker game with some friends maybe but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> no not not uh so we just ended up at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> roulette table right yeah we went to </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> that's such a that's such an alpha move </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like speech 100. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> American is a different bro what does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that work I can't let that worked either </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> what the [ __ ] that must happen quite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> often I mean this is Vegas we're talking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> about right so there's probably just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] celebrities walking around all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the time yeah I mean but it's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the fact that it was just like me and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like a bunch of the tour stuff we're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just standing around me like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and the guy looking at us like what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the face those are the famous people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actually that's the anime man I don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> know if you know yeah I saw a uh claw </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> machine in one of the casinos really it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was like a gambling claw machine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> money oh just like so you you could bet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> however much you wanted to and then it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> would be like hey if you've got one of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> the balls you'd get this much back uh so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I tried it and I was like nah this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ain't gonna now this [ __ ] ain't working </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this [ __ ] this [ __ ] is not happening </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at most I might get it once but because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like a computer that decides how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> much money you get obviously the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> computer will probably decide that you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> get to to win when it's a very tiny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amount right so it's like it's like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] this is so dumb it's not happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> going on tour has made me realize like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just Conor has an unhealthy addiction to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> claw machines now I don't know if I if I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> see one I kind of have to play it I kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> of I don't know why it's kind of you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think I'd be sick of them but I kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> just always want to play them the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> system's going on man yeah I know right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> he's it's like the jumping effect or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like all over again you've like you've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> done it so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've tortured yourself with claw </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> machines so much like you've convinced </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yourself that you like it yeah I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spent like God </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> close to 10 grand yeah I never told you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the story but like the the point I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> realized that Connor oh Conor's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> actually addicted addicted was I so we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh went to one of the uh League world's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like quarterfinals or it was like kind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of the group no it was the group stages </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in New York yeah and uh we're going and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of course we're going in to watch League </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's why we're going there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> um and so we go to take our seats and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just like one single like claw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> machine in this entire building right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like one thing that they've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put there and no one's like playing in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it and I just no no no [ __ ] off people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are playing no no one we were walking in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's free it's free to play it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> free to play and Connor just glances at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it and just goes oh there's a claw </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> machine and then I was like yeah there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a global machine I don't know what you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can when did did you did you know what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you could win yeah so it was like it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a stress ball I guess of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> League things there was like the like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> gragas barrel and a minion oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> so it was just something for like fans </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and viewers to do like in between right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> so we watched like the first two games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at this uh this event that we're in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> um and then Conor's like I'm gonna go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the toilet I'm like okay sure thing I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did go to the toilet and he did go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the toilet and so what proceeds to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happen is I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um so I so before the next game starts I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> go out as well I had to go to the toilet </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> before next game starts and I see Connor </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on this claw machine with like five </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> people around him right and I just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> thought I just thought oh it's uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because actually at that League event we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> got recognized so much because of course </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah League fans and weaves we we go </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> hand in hand so I thought you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Connor's just like Connor's playing up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know we had we have a few fans there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's playing a few cool machines with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some fans go to the toilet come back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> watch the match the entire match is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I watched the entire match by myself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thinking what the [ __ ] did Connor go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where did he go he missed an entire </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> match of League </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it was a [ __ ] game so I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is a group of like 30 people making a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> semi-circle around Connor playing this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] claw machine he had been playing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> this claw machine for 40 minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like God have you been here </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> this entire time and he's like yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> haven't won yet I'm not leaving until </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I've won like one of these [ __ ] boys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so so I went to the toilet and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was no line for it so and I'd seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a line earlier so I was like oh I'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just have a go and then I started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting recognized a lot by people there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so people started lining up to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um some people were just waiting to take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> photos some people just wanted to watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me play and then some people the people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would just gather and say like oh I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> heard this guy's good at this people </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> the beginning of that I did I did yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was so I think I think the highlight of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that like of that night because I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> been thinking about it ever since that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> night was uh we had like a secret Santa </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so we had we had a Secret Santa you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone exactly everyone got some nice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gifts and everyone but I I forgot there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> was someone who bought uh what was it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> what was that like [ __ ] sorry Kendama </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah yeah like a kendama like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese toy and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was a revolution that that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that like opened my mind to be like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't realize something so simple could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be so much [ __ ] fun holy [ __ ] it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like I forgot who actually got it for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the for the yeah that's yeah that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right diet has got it for a present who </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> Davis for it for the present and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know it's just like a small little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Kendama and and Titus was like what is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this and you know someone had to show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> him how to do it by the end of the night </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there was like at all times at least </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seven people just in a semi-circle </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> can nail it don't give it to me [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can do it it got so competitive it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just it just made me realize damn kids </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the 1950s had it [ __ ] good man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> holy [ __ ] who needs a [ __ ] iPad who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> needs [ __ ] fortnite when we have like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a [ __ ] Ken though when you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cracked in it then it's no longer fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you can do it every time no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because then you start to learn like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> special tricks and those take like years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to perfect good I'm good honestly I've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> been thinking about getting one myself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just a literal children's toy it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually so fun you know because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> initially you look you don't know you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> haven't tried it I know what it is I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> used it yeah initially you look at it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you're like this is this is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stupid I mean you try once you're like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm trying to go </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm gonna try it again I'm gonna try it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> again and and it's it's got like that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> perfect I'm gonna call it like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> gameplay Loop of just like just one more </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> time one more time I'll get at this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> level I'll get this slime Joey is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] cracked today because he he Joey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> showed us the Strat and I think that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what made it like so much fun because we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could see what we needed to do so the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stride is just like you have to pull up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to pull the string up at like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the perfect amount like strength like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> directly vertical like directly vertical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you need to [ __ ] just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> perfectly land it on the Kendama and so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there are like four stages of difficulty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they're like there's like uh if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know his here's what it looks like on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> screen right so you got like three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> appendages uh and each appendage has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a uh cup that is a different kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of size </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> um and Joey did it like so the smaller </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the smaller the size the harder it is to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> land it on that cup and Joey like Joey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tried to do it Joey showed us to do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on like the hardest difficulty setting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and everyone's like that looks easy I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just gonna go for the hardest difficulty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> setting right off the bat a quality </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> setting of your kids toy yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> yeah but Conor was on his way back from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the US right so so mailing texted me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like two hours before I was supposed to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> show up being like by the way we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing a secret santa no pressure though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like why are you telling me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because you'll you'll end the loop if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't yeah exactly so I was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like well [ __ ] I don't have time to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> out to shop for something let alone wrap </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it up so I just gotta like grab </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> something from home and so I just was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> like all right I guess if any if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's kind of doing like joke gifts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever and like not serious gifts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then I'll just I'll just give a joke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gift so I just grabbed my copy of uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> tf's tsf monogatari by Shin Noel and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just wrap that [ __ ] up yeah and placed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it and then of course out of all of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> people who had to grab my gift there are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about 40 40. yeah those are like 30 or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 40 people there yeah I had a one in 30 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to 40 chance that Sydney would grab my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gift and she grabbed my gift oh well and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like this was it all just like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> free-for-all you just grabbed a gift you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't have a person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we had a system I don't know mailings </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> did it in the most arbitrary system I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> ever seen in my life yeah like we were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we were we had like we used up like 20 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to 30 minutes figuring out system don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you just normally just go online and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> type everyone's names in then it tells </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you if you're buying a gift for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> no no no because it was like it was it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was all around it was all like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> randomized yeah that's random though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you put everyone's name into a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> website and it'll be like God is your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Secret Santa oh and they'll get the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for me it was always just like okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> there's you know all the presents are at </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the bottom of the tree right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you it's just a free you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go up and ground no it's more fun to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> know who you're buying for and then but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then if it doesn't pick up a secret </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> santa no it's secret because you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> know who's buying for you you never know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who's buying for you so this uh well I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> don't know if it's different because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> this was called like white elephant so I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> don't know if the rules are different I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mean the other thing I know is secret </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> santa white elephant why elephant it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> basically the same thing but you just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of like more of like you buy a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> random gift that you put into the pool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then yeah like all the gifts are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> randomized and you kind of like pick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from you don't know who you're buying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for you don't know and um so we came up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like mailing uh being the mom came up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with this like [ __ ] overly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> complicated system where she was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how many people bought gifts everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and put your hands up right now okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we're all gonna start we're all going to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> assign you a random number and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything like that and so we spend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 20 minutes trying to figure out the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> system and Joey just goes wouldn't it be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what's stopping us from just everyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taking a random gift and then it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> no no no we cannot do that we need the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> numbers we need the numbers and so I had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so we all had to wait for meleen to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> write like on each individual note </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] pad just be like write a number </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then like put it in a bag and then </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> celebrations for children </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> has a child because they had a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> population they have none so they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah it's just like uh we don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know what to celebrate uh children it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a momentous occasion when someone's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh you desire to have kids in Japan I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> experienced something truly Japanese the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> other day gone right gotcha </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what gotcha like you must experience in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> the weirdest way ever okay so I I rented </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> a car and there's an option on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> website that was called gacha rent a car </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where you just rent a car and you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no [ __ ] clue what car it is and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> only find out when you turn up that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sounds epic yeah so I I always rent the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> smallest car anyway because I I never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have much luggage and when I'm doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> video shoots I just need something that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can get three people to a weird place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that a trainer doesn't go to so I always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just rent like a small car like a Toyota </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yaris or something right like a tiny car </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fits for people yeah it has room for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bags and stuff and that's normally like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 6 000 Yen just for the car for the day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so it's like it's like 45 bucks so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> pretty cheap not bad um and then on the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> website I saw it was like oh but for 4 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 000 Yen so for 30 bucks basically like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not even less than that I think now you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can get a random car for the day and I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thought well it can't be worse than the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yaros like it can't be worse than the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> smallest car yeah and so I was like all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right [ __ ] it yeah I'll do it I'm down </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so I turned out and I won the gacha dude </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do you get the SSR no I don't get SSR I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> got a pretty decent I got a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Toyota Prius when I turned up okay and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> was like I'll take a break I'll take a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Prius that's kind of like a win-win </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right because if you're always going if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're if you're always going for the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three star anyway then it's only going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to go up from there right yeah literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm literally pulling for the most dog </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] thing normally so I'm like hey if I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> get what's to say the three stars the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lowest right what if you show up and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like here's your bicycle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I think the way it works is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever because obviously people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bringing cars back I think it's whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> car is just kind of like awkwardly kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of at that rent a car where someone else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't need it yet so don't transfer it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you just kind of get it so I'm going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> turn a Prius and I was like oh that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] awesome yeah less price as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah the Prius is normally 100 bucks a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> day oh hello so I was like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's [ __ ] dude you got it but I did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to Google how to uh I was in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> car the Prius I'd never driven a Prius </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before and I couldn't [ __ ] find the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> handbrake I was like how the [ __ ] do I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get this the handbrake right so I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sitting in the thing and the guy's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> asking me like oh you know how to drive </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> a [ __ ] car I don't have to drive it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a [ __ ] Prius puts it in a drive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not moving what the [ __ ] is it not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is it the foot pedal one is it yeah I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> never seen them on these before Oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really I've literally never been in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> car where it's a foot pedal uh handbrake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah and and so I I'm in the car and the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> guy the the car hose with me and my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> cameraman he's like do you know do you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know how to get it out of the handbrake </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like I have no [ __ ] clue so I'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like hey Google how do I get the Prius </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> out of hand handbrake on and off and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then a YouTube video guys this is really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> easy oh there's just a pedal at the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> bottom there's a tiny little pedal yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you just push it in and then it's a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> handbrake and I was like holy [ __ ] I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never seen that before yeah my mom had a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Prius sign </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have you have you ever seen that before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never seen it I've never seen it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this tiny little hidden thing next to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like where the break is yeah right and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just this yeah tiny tiny like like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] size of this [ __ ] and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just push it in and that's a handbrake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like oh okay but I was great I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> mean it was so cheap like with all the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gas and stuff I think the gas was only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like because it's a Prius </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was only like 20 bucks for gas oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so the whole day the rental car was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just paid for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> foreign </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> 's great in Japan but there are a lot of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> occasions where a car makes way more </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sense yeah and so I you know we were </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> going to Fuji queue which you can get a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> train robust you pretty easily but I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just want to be able to go there I wish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they would do that with all public </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> transport you know it's like it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay so you want to get front to this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> station take the train gotcha honestly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you won't know which train you're going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> on I feel like we need more gotcha every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> aspect let's see if it sounds like if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there was like let's say like on a plane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right there's 30 economy seats two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> premium one business yeah and you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> just be like [ __ ] it oh my gosh but it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> a slightly more than economy like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> slightly more you're like ah [ __ ] it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a chance I can itself play the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] restaurant hey they should do it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> go go to the restaurant and they give </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you the menu and be like you can pay for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> less but it's good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> wine you could get the Dom Perignon well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you could get it or you could get a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Capri Sun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because one of my one of my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> favorite restaurants do actually have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a gacha machine wait you took me to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it yeah yeah weird it's a catcher when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you leave oh really there's this Italian </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> restaurant uh and if you spend you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> a certain amount of money you get free </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pools on the sketch machine and you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> buy you can win either like a free drink </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or like a free meal or a lot of other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff so I don't know there's a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> uh izakayas that I've been to in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh where it's like it's kind of it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of gotcha but it's like they use </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like the dice rolling game I [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> love that game that's the Yakuza game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> right yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like it's like two dice in in a in a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> bowl yeah and uh like the one that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> near kind of my house is like you if you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> buy a beer you can do chinchiro for it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is where like depending on what's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thrown you can either get like a bigger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> price for the same price or you can get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a bigger price for free or if you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like two ones then you have to like do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> five shots or it's like you know it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's just this kind of like cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fun little method to be like all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's see is that the game they because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I I learned how to play this game after </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um kaiji yeah is it the same game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're playing kaiji season two that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just digital oh okay okay I love [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a good game yeah it's really really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good game yeah I played it I played in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> the bar Pete taught me how to play yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I went to a bar in Japan and the owner </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> would play chinchiro with you yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and yeah if you lose I I I I lost some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time so if you lose you had to do the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shot of Jaeger yeah and then and so like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the bar owner lost like three times it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like three shots of Jaeger it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty fun it's a good game you should </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Google how to play it I could explain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's it takes like a few minutes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's lots of local rules as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which is yeah basically basically roll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> High yeah that's basically it like get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> doubles yeah I went to I went to like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> craft beer place the other day that I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had a had a pretty cool system as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so they you know you can obviously buy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just buy like normal like uh glasses and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> normal pints and everything like that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but they also have the system the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> special system where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um it's like one price for us like for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like a certain amount of drink right and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then it's kind of like a tier system so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this this drink will always be this one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> price but if you can finish your string </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can order more of the same beer but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> then the next the next beer you get is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> going to be a bigger size in volume </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and it gets to a point where he gets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like a comically big size of volume like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a [ __ ] bucket by the end that's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the final tier </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um I just I remember me and Cindy went </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there and we were just like let's try </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and do it let's let's try and complete </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the game and it's it's I I want to take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone makes that sometime just to see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I just see like what what if we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> take a breath there now what if we take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a [ __ ] take a trip like like a German </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there see how far we get because we we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> got to like the second to last tier and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we were like [ __ ] what was the vessel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what was the vessel yeah what was the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> vessel it was like um are we talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a boot or yeah what was it it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know you know when you see like some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of that like you know that comically big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> wine glass that's just like oh I'm only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna have one glass of wine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [Applause] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that was that was like the second to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> last stage holy [ __ ] and then the final </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stage was just a straight it was just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a [ __ ] glass bucket almost it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it was like kind of like a yard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> basically I think there's a few of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> places that do that gimmick in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because it's like I've been to one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like that in rapongi as well yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> um that was we should we should do it to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see out of the three of us who can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> complete it I I did beer last time I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> went and I think that was a mistake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because like by the I think the second </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one or third one I was really full yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't drink this bucket I can't drink </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out of this it's not even fun to drink </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything yeah it just becomes not fast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd rather have a bunch of small glasses </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the way everyone has been doing for a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> very long time yeah it was fun for a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one-off yeah I mean I like going to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> places where they're kind of like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's they kind of just gamify something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> whether it's like [ __ ] gotcha it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> like so much gacha [ __ ] here so much to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> get your stuff in daily life yeah like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> even like you go to Akihabara you can </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> play the Sketcher machine for like 10 20 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> bucks yeah and you might get something </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> but normally you get something kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah and yeah one thing one thing I've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> never understood is uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> have you ever like you know gone to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> an anime convention right and you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they have like those special mystery </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> boxes yeah right yeah that's one thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd like that's that's one thing I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> never gotten and I don't understand why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people would get them because do you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think they actually put like good gifts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> in there so I think it originated it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> New Year's thing in Japan right it's how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it started and they're normally actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty generous right like it's meant to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be like a lot of the times you have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> book these and they're limited a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the times as well like especially some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> of the more expensive ones like the ones </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that you have to book like some of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stuff in these uh lucky but they're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> called but like in this like there's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of stuff where you can only get it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the lucky bag like it's not sold </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> anywhere else it's like a special like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> package but like you won't know what it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is until you get it right I got one last </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time from amiami it was 500 bucks and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely got more than 500 worth of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> figures in the Box the Pokemon one for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> example the Pokemon's in every year like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to book that [ __ ] like four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> months Jesus I didn't realize you had to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> book this year man of course yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan uh yeah you have to all the good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ones you have to book but you also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> generally it's more like a celebratory </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing than a let's make a lot of money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like all right that's that's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like happy New Year yes happy New Year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you know New Year's one of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> biggest things in Japan and then I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> uh you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um when American consort they're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> money is this a money-making and ax was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> always that one booth I can't remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which one it was there was that one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they would make the Walls World </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the lucky boxes remember these yeah the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> animation right there that just have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a booth that was made out of these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lucky boxes yeah I remember that and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> dude you just they have never had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anything good enough never never they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good for Content that's about it even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> then like move down or edited a video of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I think with uh hard on unboxing one of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> them but it's just the saddest thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ever and it was like 50 bucks nothing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> nothing good in it he gave me like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> squid game plush that wouldn't shut up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's like a tiny one yeah you press </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever the [ __ ] inside yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like oh my God this is so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's funny oh man what's normal to do in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Japan for like New Year's what's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the tradition here the tradition is to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to go to like a temple right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah Temple oh that's usually a news day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> um but like for me like this year I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going back to my Grandma's place up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> north uh because like it's very much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's weird like Christmas and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mean you already went to your Grandma's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> place yeah it's the New Years the New </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Year fantastic I loved it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um yeah so I think it's it's interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> because like I thought about this it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like Christmas and New Year's how it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> celebrated in the west is like the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> complete opposite to how to celebrate in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Japan yeah because it's like in the west </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like Christmas is for the family </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then New Year's is where you get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sloshed with your mates right right but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> in Japan it's the opposite Christmas is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> like a couple's thing or you get sloshed </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> with your single friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I've been there yeah and New Year's is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> when you go back home and you spend it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with your family all right right and so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like at least for me like the tradition </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is like usually I go back to my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Grandma's place like a few days before </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> New Year's Eve and then we do like a big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like final cleanup of the house to kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of like you know not to like physically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> clean up the house but also just like to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> refresh ourselves like you know for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> upcoming year that's what they say yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you come in and clean my house right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's just an excuse for my grandma </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be my clean my house [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um so I go there I clean the house and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> um we have this thing called </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which is uh which is you have this bowl </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> of soba uh as your final meal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> um and uh for the year not yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's uh and uh I don't remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> what the exact reasoning behind why you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> eat the strawberries but there's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> some kind of uh like traditional </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> reasoning behind why you would do it um </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so then you would eat that and then the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> New Years happens then you go to the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> temple first thing in the morning </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> usually uh to do like you know your </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> first prayers and stuff like that and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> then you eat osichi which is like a type </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of uh traditional Japanese like huge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] platter of like I think like 50 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different things like small little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different things like imagine what you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> get I think I've seen this you can I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seen this to be able to book it yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen it yeah you usually usually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you book it I mean people who are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> pros just like make it themselves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um but like uh think of like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the breakfast at a dualcon think of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that by like four times yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you share it among your entire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's really good but it's like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely something you can't have is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it is it like the chocolate boxes where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like Everyone likes a certain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the one chocolate and everyone's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I have yo can I have that yeah can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have like that and then I'm good I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't want the [ __ ] squid [ __ ] I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> good yeah there's always like there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> always like two or three that are just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like untouched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> looks nice it's just there for variation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> help yourself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um I feel like there are some real items </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that people just buy just for like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just because everyone else bought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it before yeah do you have um like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> half the [ __ ] mugs were just Easter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> egg mugs because they're the cheapest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shittest mugs that your parents wouldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mind letting you take to you right do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you remember seeing these now all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time in University now that you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> mining now that you remind me I'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> having a lot [ __ ] yeah you're the wave I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember I see the [ __ ] Cadbury and </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> adjacent to it and this was like I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> never seen that yeah it was everywhere </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like every single [ __ ] chocolate bar </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> about them like why the [ __ ] do we want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so many mugs this is too many mugs for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the team yeah but I already have mugs </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> okay actually this is the this doesn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remind me about a totally different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> topic okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> decorating a room right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my room my house was always decorated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with as I said like teacups and places </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something like that so I never really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> got to like let's say I never really got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to a point where I knew what to do with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> decorating my own room I never had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> posters I never had like different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> things in my room to like show my own </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> personality what like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm I'm guessing you put a lot of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> music posters in your room and stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah that right I I don't even know how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to get posters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what do you mean how do I get them what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> do you mean just go you go to stores I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't have money we're getting this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> money from that there were like three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> bucks no like the good push like five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> pounds in the UK you don't get the good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> ones you get the [ __ ] ones so I only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ever put shitty posters up when I came </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a magazine for free yeah and I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think I also that's why you start off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I think I got a free </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a poster of Halo and like Halo Reach or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> something and I put that [ __ ] on did you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> did you ever have trouble like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> decorating your room in University </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because I didn't decorate my room you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't at all no it was a little like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Serial Killer's room I I had nothing on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the walls nothing I I didn't get in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> head I was like why would I decorate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like I'm leaving this room in a year oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's true that's true but I've seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some University rooms and they are like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> filled to the [ __ ] brim with like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> different stuff and I was like how the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] are you affording this yeah I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I never decorated ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> had like one poster and that was it it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was okay I think I think I bought one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> poster just so like if anyone came in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> here they wouldn't think they were going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> into a super chemistry it was I think it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was like a [ __ ] start Scarface poster </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like let me buy something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from like the university fair and I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what's something I can buy that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> cheap that would also make me feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a normal person scar faces Scarface is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that poster that's on the brink of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm a normal person but I'm a little bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> quirky </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he was just waiting for the Wolf of Wall </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Street to come out yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because I was like well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't put anime on my wall that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of the question that just means uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> that just means I'm just going to be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> shunned from every social group in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Universe back when anime wasn't accepted </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so I was like how do I let me pretend to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> be a normal human let me scientifically </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> work this out what is something I can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> put on my wall that's like oh I got a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> little bit of Personality </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> quirky it's either Scarface or Pulp </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fiction </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> choices like either Scarface or Pulp </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Fiction and that was it I just always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wanted to spend my money on food so I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> thought I'm not gonna decorate my room </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> it's dumb I'm also like if I'm moving </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> like every year yeah what's the point in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> decorating I just put a PC in my room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> did you move every year uh yeah every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> single year of University I moved oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] oh wow okay so the first year I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in student dorms I'm in the UK I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know if I was in your University in mine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh you're only allowed to be in student </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dorms for one year and then you had to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> find your own accommodation ah and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously because like you know some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> roommates dropped out and some roommates </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you know whatever like people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> changed so I just always moved every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> year yeah when I was only in University </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for three years yeah so you know I was I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was living at home so I was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> decorating my own room like I had this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like weird conversation with Sydney the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> other day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um because like Sydney was like Sydney </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cindy found this like [ __ ] up movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> icebergs here this kind of thing and I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think I've watched that we've watched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that I think yeah it's not like the two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and a half hour one on YouTube no she </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just found like the image of it right oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I come home and she was like I'm I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thinking about like going through this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Iceberg I was like Sydney don't don't do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not [ __ ] do that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> um because I I I I I don't really like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> horror movies and I'm not really like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't really have like I have morbid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> curiosity but I've never I've been but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you also have a sense of reason I also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have a sense of reason as well but I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ended up I I looked at the iceberg tier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> list and I ended up realizing that I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seen a lot of this a lot of these movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the reason because of that uh is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because uh when I went to University </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was a phase where people like like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your roommates you always knew that I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] one guy that would try to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> show you the most [ __ ] up thing that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they could find whether it be something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a Serbian film or other like things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they found on something on like Reddit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 50 50 or something yeah and Sydney had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just like never experienced that so I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was like I was like realizing is this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this a me thing that no happened in my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> face yeah it's either in high school or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in college like you had that one yeah it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was in high school for me it was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that one kid that was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it made me wonder if it's still a phase </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I think it became a phase </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because of [ __ ] like you know two girls </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one cup and everything like that so I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like do the good old days it's it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anyone in University you know anyone in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> college or high school is there is this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> still a thing for sure where are you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> guys still showing each other two girls </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as long as long as there's the internet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if someone wants to be a little age Lord </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of course involved right that's that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> how life is God I saw some of the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> traumatic [ __ ] in high school just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because of that one [ __ ] friend yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to that one friend who is not a friend </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> anymore [ __ ] you like you've literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> scarred me for life of some of the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that you've shown me yeah I do not want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to like I don't know oh no it's horrible </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> far it's it's a it's something man it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm kind of glad that we finally got a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> show that was hyped and so far has been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> following through like I every episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is a delight it's [ __ ] weird it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just insane every episode is like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> movie budget it's it's a lot crazy the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fact that there's a different ending </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every time as well like I it's kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> insane I'm I am blown away it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sweaty yeah yeah oh [ __ ] we gotta live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> up to that it's kind of crazy even as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I even if I wasn't a fan of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> show it's like you're watching it you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like there's you just can't not be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> amazed by it like oh yeah you don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> enjoy it it's [ __ ] insane yeah oh the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> story is crude sometimes but let's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I like it I think it's fun I mean I I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's it's obviously a bit edgier </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> than like a lot for sure for sure it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> feels like edgy yeah but I don't feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's like edgy for the sake of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like edgy like we've seen with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like some other shows you know where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like oh this is the show that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> aimed towards 15 year olds that you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> want to think they're watching something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> adult no it's clearly just like Fujimoto </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just being like I don't give a [ __ ] if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people like this or not like this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just how I'm gonna make my story and how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna make my characters yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the I was kind of amazed at one point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episode nine the episode before ends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with the scene and then they reused the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scene in The Next Episode but they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reanimate it very slightly entirely all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over again and I'm like okay now this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's too much that's just a waste like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this is insane but this is like what and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's all insane animation like yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like I don't understand how how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much money or time power costing money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> again I go and travel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like I mean the amount of time money and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> effort put into this is must be another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> level like the amount talent that must </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have gone into this is insane what blows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my mind is when you know when people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like look at something and think good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> animation they think oh the fight scene </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like good or they they think of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fight scene like chainsaw man just looks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good in like everything the talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scenes oh my God it's so [ __ ] every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shot is so like Dynamic right it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know sometimes you watch an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> anime it's just like always like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basic shot for shot for sure there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> always that always feels like there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some thought and to put some thought put </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into how this like how this looks on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> films like what angle have we not put a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> camera at yet wait let's do it let's do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it from there like I know you've read </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the Manga but you you need to watch the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime I am watching it oh you are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> watching it of course I I can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I kind of have to I don't I think I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> would actually be hung in quartered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anime is so good that I'm like I really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't want to touch the manga I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this this is what I'm saying I know I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> bet it is but like watching the anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like there's no first season's only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna end halfway so probably probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I think the manga is as good as the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anime I agree I've been doing something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a little quirky I've been watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh watching the anime then read in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> manga oh okay shut the [ __ ] up guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't [ __ ] say that [ __ ] [ __ ] what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you [ __ ] why the [ __ ] could you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> do that why would you do that why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um because why why did that because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anime is my medium of choice if I have a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> choice um and the anime is doing an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing production but I think uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tatsuki Fujimoto the mangaka is an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> absolute [ __ ] genius I agree uh he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uses manga in a way that no other manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> artists I think has done he has such a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> unique way of conveying like his ideas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and emotions and it's a way that is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> impossible to replicate in any other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> medium because he's able to draw it in a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> way that looks and feels cinematic yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> which I think is really hard to do in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the medium of manga like because you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> know again it's like a lot like with a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of anime it's like you have your bog </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> standard like you know flow of panels </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and like you know maybe every now and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then there'll be an artist they'll be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Oh I'm gonna draw outside of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> panel like literally outside of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> panel to kind of add like Dynamic to it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like fujimota just kind of draws it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in a way where it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this flows in a really smooth way but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's also a really strange feeling yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> at the same time like now that I've like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> read like what's been adapted so far and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh in in the manga I'm like how the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> does tatsuki Fujimoto have better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comedic timing in the manga which has no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comedic timing than in the anime right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's he he's the job he's done with is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the way he's like paneled and laid </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> out his page it like this the scenes in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> among there are like some funny scenes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that are like way funnier I think in the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> manga than in the anime </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um and it's just because of the way that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> he's kind of like timed it really well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with how like you turn the page and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff like you have any examples that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you might be able to think of um I can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think of off the top of my head if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> did yeah I think there's there's a few </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> things that I think have like are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> impossible to translate to the anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like one of one thing I can think of is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um how can I say this without spoiling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anything that happens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so there is there is a weapon that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> involves a nail right uh if if you've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> what if you're like you you've nine I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> on episode nine episode you should have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seen it then there's a there's a weapon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that involves a nail </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe it's it's like it's like a demon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of thing right a nail as in this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> nail </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> okay all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> no I haven't I don't know I don't oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this nail oh I'm doing something that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> involves this obviously something that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> involves this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah you definitely have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have I yeah maybe did you think it was a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> sword </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe it was a sword </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe you should I [ __ ] I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> all right okay we'll carry on yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but uh there's a scene where he uses </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this weapon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and obviously it's a weapon that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like infused with a demon right yeah so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> there's this there's this like really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> cool panel where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um like to use this weapon you have to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have a contract with a devil that's what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> every that's what every weapon is right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and so how he portrays that this weapon </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is controlled by this devil is that you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have you have like the normal panels and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's how it is throughout the entire </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> manga every comic book and then when he </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> uses this uh when he uses weapon the a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> finger just appears from that goes from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like outside of like the Box panels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and so it kind of like flicks from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> out of frame into frame and you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's cool oh that's really [ __ ] cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be like oh there's something that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like called out from like outside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this world and [ __ ] like that and I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like you can't really do that in anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's it's you know okay I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have boxes and [ __ ] like that but it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like small things like that where he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really thinks about how do I like how do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I how do I do something that it's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cool that only manga can do and he does </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this in not just like me not just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chainsaw man but pretty much everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've read from him he does something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unique to manga that I've not seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> anywhere else </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and that's true especially if you've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not read like I would highly recommend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> goodbye Arie which is like one shot you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can read that okay within like that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so genius yeah and I was like I've never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I've never read something that is just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like so it's it's a masterpiece in my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> mind so [ __ ] genius yeah I mean yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> gentleman I've loved it so far I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it yeah it's it's crazy to see uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because again we've had hyped up shows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I don't think we've had a show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's been this hyped up in so long I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't think ever yeah and um yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> insane to see it kind of meeting it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of crushing it because it goes I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was a bit worried because I remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> watching like the first six episodes I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this is cool but it's kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> your standard yeah standard affair right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> now yeah from episode like five six </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> onwards it definitely got way more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> excited yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> um and it's been like so fun watching it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but also I'm sad that I have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wait every week uh I'm I'm sad that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're gonna have to wait for a season </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> two yeah hopefully hopefully </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is the manga finished uh part one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> manga is finished so he's currently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> writing so he went on a little bit of a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> break after part one and now he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> starting up part two again oh okay yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I did get a chuckle out of I guess it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not really spoiler but like at one point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that like the name of a demon is is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> means it's strength or something and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like what's what's the scariest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> thing a chainsaw in a garden I was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what I was like what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you have this like really intensely like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really edgy built up world they're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gun strong </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like all right that stuff doesn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really spoil anything it's just yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just funny even like I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> what yeah I don't think it's not wrong </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but things just get more and more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> intense in the morning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never watched the show and actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> said what the [ __ ] out loud so many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> times like this [ __ ] happens you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> God and the second half of the manga is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like I believe it I believe it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like the last two or three volumes are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just insane I'm just like I don't what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm I'm very happy I'm very excited uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> wait is it 12 episodes they're doing or </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> we can do come on let's get more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episodes I don't need the ending every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> time the time yeah yeah I really hope we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> don't have to wait too long for another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> season because it's I think we are this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is I think we are if there was it's been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> a while since I've watched a show and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like 12 up that's that's it that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it 12 episodes I've never been breaked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> up through the entire show like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before yeah like from start to finish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the food I'm like I'm Rock Solid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when they show food in the show the food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looks so good that's perfect I've never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> been more [ __ ] bricked up watching a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> hand-holding scene oh right right holy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] man like talk about like Awakening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something I'm like I thought this was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> meme I thought hand holding hands I was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a meme man they actually [ __ ] made it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a thing dude every character has awoke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with something you never wants yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never I'm impressed that they've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> managed to make a character who is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> horny likable I I figured anyone that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> horny in real life would would uh sorry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in any show normally if a character is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just super horny it's like like meliodas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I [ __ ] hate them yeah they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] suck but that's the thing that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what another thing with Fujimoto </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I think is genius is that like not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just chainsaw man but everything he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> written every character is an absolute </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> piece of [ __ ] yeah but he's somehow able </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to turn these absolute [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> detestable piece of [ __ ] characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> likable well it's like in real in real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> life right most people agree like most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people do bad things so they do good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> things right so it's like if you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of channel that and I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's where it's it's doing that great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it so far changed some man all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> characters don't feel like they good bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like all right you know they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again maybe they've got a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> problems maybe maybe they're a bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> person but they do some good things but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen I've also seen a lot of anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where they just like they try and make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a like a purposeful like shitty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> character right yeah like oh okay you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know all the all the edgy people are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna enjoy this one and then it just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> ends up being extremely annoying yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean this could easily be like a Mirai </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Nikki situation exactly it's like haha </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Edge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone is shitty everyone 20 and we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all gonna stab each other and it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> all right well it's it's kind of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's I I think he strikes that perfect </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> balance where he pretty much every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> character and change the mind it's kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of like an [ __ ] yeah absolutely but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's like it's like an entertaining </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] because they're all trying to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> survive right yeah so it's like you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how would you act if you had to survive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah in this in this world that is very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] up yeah like like just like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> remember the scene where they were all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like trapped in the building together oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah just [ __ ] chaos and I was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like I was just like it feels like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watching a scene from Always Sunny in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Philadelphia </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because it was just like why am I having </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> such a good time just seeing these guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> try to survive it's it's been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> complaining yeah they're in like a life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and death situation and they're just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's just [ __ ] bands man just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when Danger's like I'm going to sleep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I [ __ ] love that scene it's like bro </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> who's that scene where uh one of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> girls like freaking out I would just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like like burst like full-on burst out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> laughing and I was just like what it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just it's just [ __ ] it's a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> riot man so good oh it's yeah it's been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> a long time since I've been this excited </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> for an anime I just hope they don't give </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me a reason to ever dislike the show so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> far I'm pretty happy yeah to be honest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> nah I mean even the second half as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> chaotic as it gets like it's just so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> intense and insane where it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of course this is how it is and I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the like complaints about CG that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've seen on Twitter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> oh no dude there's like barely any CG </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then when it is it's like it's good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the most awkward looking shots </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> were like in episode one yeah and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like they still use CG in like other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> flies and it just they've managed to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> blend it a lot better but even in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> episode one it was like it looked a bit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dodgy here and there like a few shorts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but didn't look bad you know I've seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> bad CG I've seen Exxon </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen extra </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> she's watching it I was like this should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be such a different show from set in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> America </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wait what do you mean okay okay very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very quick kind of I guess life spoiler </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not really yeah there's like a whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> scene where there's a bunch of guns </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> involved I was like they were like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> superpower is gone I was like I was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well yeah I guess that makes sense that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> makes sense and I was like this this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> an America this would be really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different by now this would be a really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> different show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my superpower is gone there's literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like a scene in the video he's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everything gun beats everything and I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was like yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> miniguns are legal in Texas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this finna will be 12 episodes in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> America dude oh my God no this is fun it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was just a good time it's just fun it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> was fun oh my God so many shows in anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> very much saved by the fact they're set </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in Japan because there are no guns yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if they were in America could you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> imagine if my hero Academia was set in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> America it's like go save him Deku oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] he's got an AK </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a porn might be like oh no back again </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> was shot by a Barrett 50 caliber he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't recover yeah Fortnight yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I just I just I just it just made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> me realize how many shows are more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> believable in terms of realistic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> somewhat because they're not because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they're set in Japan yeah yeah you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> away with this because you're in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah you wouldn't need a superhero </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> organization was an American death note </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if there was just guns as well like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was more guns like Al just had a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gun the entire time which I feel would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have been way shorter like no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like oh you're Kira </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> are you like so many it just made me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> realize how many shows could have been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> quicker if there was Guns yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> basically you've just like erased every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Shonen from existence </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Kuroko no basket you know but he hasn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> gone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I I watched um I obviously I've read all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh all of the parts of Jojo except for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the last part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and I I was re-watching uh Stone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ocean and I remember I was like oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there is a whole part about lynching in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it yeah and I was like that's I and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was watching I was like this is weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching this in Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like an over-the-top narrated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> narrating about how somebody you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how about like racial tensions in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Florida I was like this is really weird </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like I don't remember that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah right there's a whole there's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> character's whole backstory where a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> character you know uh was Lynch and it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was talking about how racist and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really odd because the narrator narrates </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> about racism in Florida and it was very </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> weird seeing them how they handled </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> narrating it in Japanese yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it was um I can't remember how </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they did it but I remember it was a bit </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> odd yeah and I was like yeah I guess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's one way of mentioning how it all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> works that is yeah that does that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is what happened yeah that is what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happened it was just kind of like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normal anime thing and then it goes but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> did you forget that this is 19th 1980s </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Florida and this racial Prejudice is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like whoa Iraqi where is this coming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> from what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Rocky watched 12 years of slave </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we just it was just like funny Plankton </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> go he he punching and then it goes and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then it just goes straight into that and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like what the [ __ ] it's like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> documentary yeah it was just kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like whoa Iraqi like and just seeing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> animated just reminded me like oh yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this yeah yeah okay this is this is set </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in America they really wanted to use </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that setting here that was all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> okay all right a bit intense yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because like every time every time I've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> seen like portrayals of like say like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> racism in uh anime and manga it's always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tough it's always tough right it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's always tough and especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like real like seeing like Jojo part six </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know in we've we've seen we've seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stories portrayed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um you know in Western media and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something and I still I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like a kind of like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> powerful but it's also if it said in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> modern day it can be like subtle as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know yeah but every every time I see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it in [ __ ] anime and manga it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> always the most in your face look at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> racism this is racism I think because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like if you if you go back and look at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> movies of like 2000s and 90s yeah that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> was kind of how you know a lot of these </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> big Hollywood Productions are kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> portraying racism it's like look we can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> solve it with a movie and a good speech </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's it's fixed yeah and I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that that kind of way of looking at it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was kind of because obviously the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> conversation isn't nearly as prevalent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here in Japan yeah things like that kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of way of viewing it and talking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was kind of taken into how anime does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it yeah or sometimes it's just flat a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> racist in anime like gants that's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> weird yeah like that I mean you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that happens in anime sometimes my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> favorite is the Last Arc initial 21. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that one is so poorly yeah it's not good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's very nice and it's very nice it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ashamed it's like damn it like it's such </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a good artist obviously like this stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was was written at a time when this was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> barely a conversation in in the west </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like Stone ocean was written I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think early 2000s 2003 right before this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was this this conversation was like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know barely started in the western world </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and then now looking at it through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> our modern lens of how we view it and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how we talk about these topics it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> oh yeah that's a bit yeah I mean it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like it's like the way okay but by the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> way it's not bad in JoJo right it's I'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> just it's just like you you're reading </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it or you're watching it and you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it is a bit like weirdly shoved in it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's been shoe horny it's yeah it feels </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like it feels very it comes out of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> face it comes out of it he really I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember watching the episode and I was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just like Wow have you read the Manga I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> haven't read she didn't know that was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> coming no no it was coming and I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> still like oh my God </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sorry I'm watching JoJo part six </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching a [ __ ] span battle get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> against women </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> racism I was like what JoJo what the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it was narrated as well and the narrator </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> talks about it in a very weird way I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> think it felt like it was very uh I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't even know how to describe it it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just odd it was odd yeah I was watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it and I even know what was happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like Yep this is as weird as I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> remember it being yeah this is a bit odd </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's really weird that the two portrait </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the two big portrayals of racism in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> anime manga that I remember one is now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like Jojo the other one is like domestic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> girlfriends what what yeah because the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> uh there's there's an arc there's an arc </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where one of the girls uh goes to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> America to uh to to uh I was a mommy or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever her name was it's rui oh no I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking of Randy girlfriend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> uh it's uh so she goes to America to go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> learn how to be a chef and be a cook and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> she goes uh to America to a culinary </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> school and uh she the best way I can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> describe it is she encounters racism and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not subtle all racism at all it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very very in your face it's almost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty much the same level of what I saw </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Jojo and it was it just put things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into perspective of me as like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like it's really good that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there are these portrayals and Anime I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think it's good it's just also it's it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's very jarring it's very jarring </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> considering what's you know the stories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I've seen told in like Western Street </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> domestic girlfriend yeah a domestic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> girlfriend she's like this is not this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it'd be like watching a Thomas the Tank </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then suddenly it's like hardcore </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> racism it's like whoa oh it's like we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> don't we don't talk to the cars Thomas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> we don't [ __ ] with those it was it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> so jarring and I I just was not prepared </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> for it and I wouldn't even call it like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> subtle yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> um but at least you know at least it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happening you know at least it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> happening yeah again I don't think I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> not trying to be like no no this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> conversations can't have an anime it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like I think sometimes it's it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> needs to be implemented a little a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> little subtle a little more in a way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it doesn't feel like there was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there was nothing in JoJo or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even remotely about like yeah racism at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all or any of those things and then boom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they just throw it in there it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whoa and it only happens once yeah it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just happened once never comes up again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like there was yeah there's like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> mean for the characters it's a big thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I I like the character and I like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> how they're all worked into it it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of came out of nowhere </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um but it was cool I I like I again I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like Jojo a lot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> racism </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I I like it when anime tries to go into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this stuff and tries to be more mature </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um but yeah it wasn't I showed as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't it well well I still did it in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> way that was very not cool no that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wasn't cool I'm trying to think of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah there's just some it's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> okay come on let's have let's have more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> characters like you know like I see I I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of people are like no I don't want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any diversity in my shows I'm like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dude [ __ ] it yeah let's have more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> diversity and sure like if it lends to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the story well let's [ __ ] do it if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not jarrant to the story and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can implement it in a way that seems </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> natural then hell yeah I was like shield </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 21 was just like dude it is a black guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> playing sports he must be amazing at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them it's like what that is not how you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> introduce a character that is not that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is not how you introduce anyone it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> flat out I I think it was just the fact </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that they basically gave him a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> superpower and his superpower was yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah he was he was black and I was just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I Shield what what are you doing it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> just like that Meme of like the the guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> with his like smiling and then his mouth </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> drops it's like yeah more diversity </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Anatomy yeah oh I found out why this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> diversity oh no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know I feel like summer it's you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> could make some really [ __ ] cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stories with it just be be like better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with it like don't just do it don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shoot don't shove it and don't shove it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just in a racist way in a racist way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah well I mean I mean it's cool you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know if we see these kinds of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> portrayals because it means like there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is some kind of conversation happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Japan yeah it just you know it seems </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty cool to have that yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just seeing it you obviously see that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the conversation is like not as like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> far-flung as what we've had in the west </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> no because in Japan it's not so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about like targeting a specific race </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's about targeting all Races yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> essentially a lot of times people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> complain that there's not enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> diversity in uh on anime and stuff I see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of people like well it's for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese people there you know what do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you mean what do you expect for them I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> mean yes Japan is very homogeneous but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not like there's no diversity no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like pretending like other other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like ethnicities don't exist here yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just flat out wrong like yeah Joey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is a hopper like you know what I mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like straight up just not true they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> always say like it doesn't exist in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan or is you know that's the problem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like it's such a small minority </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> even in Japan and I think in in the eyes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of like the the Manga and Anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Industries just like oh okay yeah we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> know they exist but are they a market </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that reads monger and watches anime yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we don't know so instead of just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> pertaining to the one percent let's try </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and just make the 99 happy and it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay yeah you can do that if you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but again you're gonna start running </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> into problems like I shielded yeah I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not saying just start shoving it in like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> crazy to meet quotas or anything like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that because that has clearly not been a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> solution anyway if the story lends well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to it let's [ __ ] do it because it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> makes sense right like just like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pattern I've seen in all of these things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that we just mentioned is that does the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime or Manga have an America Arc you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't need to put racism in it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's like has an America you do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah manga artists need to understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> racism exists outside of America as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not exclusive to America it's an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> American exclusive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> oh my God </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> what a great way to end trash taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> steps okay talking about races you gotta </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> love it hey but uh look at all these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> patrons right here they don't laugh at </SPEAKER_03>
