<SPEAKER_03> what i've realized okay i've like living </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in japan has made me change my opinion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay so before moving to japan or before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like moving on to totally unrelated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not totally unrelated because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> before moving to japan or moving out of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> england my favorite season was summer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> okay yeah i was i was we've discussed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this in the podcast before and we were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or maybe it was just off camera </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i remember we were like talking about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because i think you and i both like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> winter like much much more winter's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> worth season lots </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off winter's worst season maybe this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> should become a conversation that we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> have every single year the summer turns </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> around and everyone's like you guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> spoke about this already i'm like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my head shut up no because like i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't realize that uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like summer wind uh summers in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> england are actually pretty good and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why summer was my favorite season </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that doesn't get in england it's like 25 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> degrees celsius summer yeah that's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> thing right that's the thing no no it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> gets hotter than that god that gets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> harder one there's someone the summer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> before we left right yeah but that one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> week is pure hell because uk we don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have air conditioning just doesn't exist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> true in homes yeah the one time i went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the uk it was during that week it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> horrible because you know at least in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese summer it's like oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> walking outside [ __ ] this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's way worse but you can just go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in any any building anywhere and you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they've got the they've got yeah they've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> got the ac running at full like full </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> blast like it's good but in the uk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have no escape in the uk it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe the gym has ac the supermarket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> probably has it but like that's it like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you go home you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> put on the tv </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah cause like what do you do to cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down in the uk have like nine fans on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you so so you do have bands yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fans don't do [ __ ] yeah fans don't do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] fans are like that's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dissipating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> placebos yeah of like you're like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's definitely doing something you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like why am i still sweating so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because all it is is just taking the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stagnant hot air and just moving it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> around right yeah occasionally i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you go up to it you know i put my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shirt over the fan yeah i'm like this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> true cooling that's that's the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> feature </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe it's a nostalgia thing for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because growing up or like spending my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> summers in thailand uh you know um in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> thailand we tried to save costs as much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as possible you know so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the ac is always like the last </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> resort that's like when we're literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like dying of heat stroke yeah any other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time it's just like come on you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> survive with the fan so like i spent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> most of my like time and experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being cooled down by a fan and ac was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like okay if we don't put the ac on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we're probably going to die here so it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's i think that's why it's like kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of nostalgic for me like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i kind of like the fan like i kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like the female fan just just on me but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i admit like if you're not used to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like i felt sorry when you visited </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yanaki visited us in the uk because you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to subscribe yes yes sleep in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> room and we that was like there was one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fan in there there was a single fan in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like my entire house like joey you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have the fan and i was like i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> think i actually did anything for you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was butt [ __ ] naked in your bed i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like i'm still dying it sucks it it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't help and it doesn't get cold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> during the night the fan yeah i get like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the whole like fan being nostalgic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> though because like i have that exact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same thing at my suffering is nostalgic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at my grandma's old place in the middle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of nowhere in the mountains yeah we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't have ac </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just because the house was too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> big to have a single ac unit yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also all the doors were always open so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was always with a fan yeah but is it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's nostalgic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is it good memories though no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i love just dying slowly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that was the time when i almost died of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> heat in my grandma's house good times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you might be confusing nostalgic with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like ptsd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i like i like the feeling of like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> prefer the heat the feeling of summer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over winter like any day of the week i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know i'm just like i'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> depressed in winter winter's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> even even like dying in this heat i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> still prefer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what i'm experiencing experiencing now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to winter what what happens to you in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the winter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah what happens which is just the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worst scene to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it is it's the worst season okay okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay yeah i think it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scientifically proven that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people are less people are more happy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with more sunlight right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think it's literally more healthier </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for you to get more sunlight because you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are literally happier see more there is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sunlight in the window there's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> barely any sunlight in the winter and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay here's here's the thing that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> depresses me the most okay especially if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're working a nine-to-five job you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to commute to work you wake up it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you wake up maybe seven a.m or whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if if you have to commute long it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seven eight a.m you wake up it's dark </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you go to the office at nine and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> still just like the sun's just rising i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> love you stay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you stay inside literally all day you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just in the office with after artificial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> light you go out it's 5 p.m and again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's dark i like that i like the night </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like how can you look how could you not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want any sunshine in your life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know most of the time i have my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> curtains closed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> too hot even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in my office now i have them closed all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the time and like the second thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything's dead in the winter there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no color at all you look outside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything's gray everything's drab how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can you be happy with like zero color i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know i i just think you're you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a boring person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like like literally the only thing to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> look forward to in winter is christmas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'm pretty sure they're interesting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> about christmas i'm pretty sure they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> invented christmas because if they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't have christmas like everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would just have nothing to look forward </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to objection i'm from australia we </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> kind of like just it's not cold but it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a little bit like oh okay maybe i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could you know put something light on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the moment you hop in that bed and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you put that blanket over you and you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just wrapped in a warm cocoon there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i'm unstoppable this sleep is on my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> side now and you just get the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] sleep yeah the mornings suck but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah the mornings dude for me all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mornings suck i can't wake up in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> morning so it doesn't make a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> difference to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay the only thing i could say i will </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say is that i can wear turtlenecks in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the winter exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> would they be steve jobs without weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sucks because you your options are so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> limited in the winter it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> shorts but that's the last but that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why i like british summers because what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i realized is that british summers is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like a comfortable like it's it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> comfortable temperature most of the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> pre-global warming yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was good because you know this didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> used to happen and it was never like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this in the uk where it was that bad i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> remember we always complain about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> british summers to be like every like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every british person i've met is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh you haven't experienced british </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> summer it's like really it's it's rain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes it's cold sometimes and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like it's like it actually slaps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> compared to other subjects i would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> compare to other places yeah i would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have agreed with you until like two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> years ago when for some reason two years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a row which had horrible heat waves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just ruined the summer for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was always fun in the uk the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> best part about it is i like it in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> summer when the day is hot and the night </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gets cool yeah but in japan it doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> get cool oh it does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no i think it does no compared to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to now like because you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like what [ __ ] 2 p.m right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it is like the hardest time of the day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right now right yeah yeah but compared </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to that euro yeah carry on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but compared to that when it's you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the sun finally goes down like what like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 8 00 p.m yeah maybe and like around like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nine or ten it's like it's pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comfortable that's that's the kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> weather where i'm like okay i'm really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comfortable i can't concentrate with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that guy </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> that i like having as much as i said as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much sunlight as possible and i just i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like my favorite time period of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> entire year is about like what's what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the word like dusk summertime when like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the sun's setting it's about seven eight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pm and you're just watching the sunset </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man you feel like a [ __ ] anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> character because it's just like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just you know it's it's it's that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] scene where you're just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where the [ __ ] dude in every opening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where like they're the protagonist is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching the sunset and the wind's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> blowing how often you are you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> standing out how old are you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> being like how the [ __ ] are you watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it yeah how often are you watching this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> shut the [ __ ] up no it's anime shut the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> scene on tatooine right where he's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> watching the sun go down how often how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> often are you watching the sunset </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly that's why i love my balcony </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why i have a hammock out there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because oh no you [ __ ] off you're not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching the sunset every day i'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> watching it i'm not watching it every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> day but the hottest time of the day in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> my opinion because you're getting that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like direct [ __ ] sunlight the whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> time of the day is [ __ ] now i can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> stand out there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's hot until the sun goes down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the moment the sun rises it's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> hottest time of the day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no i mean i don't know man i like going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> outside and i don't want to have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shed away my life expectancy to just go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> outside yeah i guess that's why for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in japan i think my favorite season is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably spring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for me it's the autumn autumn yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> around like october it's probably my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> favorite time of the year just because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like again you have that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know variance in drip right you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wear a jacket if it gets a little bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cold in the night but you can take it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> off and you know rock a long sleeve </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right but it's also not so cold that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's excruciating but it's not too hot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> either </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel like that's the same spring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> though and i like the i like the whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have we talked about hanami at all like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the cherry blossoms sir i mean like so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean you've you know you you watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anime right you know what cherry cherry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is awesome you know what [ __ ] cherry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> blossoms i will lie i was slightly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> disappointed to find out that cherry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> blossoms are only around for like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> week and they [ __ ] off because i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hold out there and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> all the anime all the time what's going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on with that yeah they film all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> anime in the same week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i realized it's like a cult in japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they they're obsessed with this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they had on me like everything revolves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when hanumi's coming up everything is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hanami yeah like well yeah everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> has to become cherry blossom it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything everyone just joins like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> caller because there's a really like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> extensive history right right but it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's nuts like it's i understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why it's an anime so much now but when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got here i'm like wow literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything is decorated like like it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> call of duty gun skin it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything's there every it doesn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> matter what it is it gets a cherry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> blossom skin i mean not gonna lie man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a good honey is [ __ ] dark yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but it's good it is disappointing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really weird yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this week yeah this year this year i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sorry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't do anything this year because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i totally forgot i didn't know when it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was coming i i had one of the best </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> harmonies this year i'd rather enjoy me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> river it's just like rows and rows of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sakura trees do you want to explain what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hanami is to the viewers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> literally means flower watching yeah in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> japanese so it's it's basically this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of i wouldn't even say it's like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> festival it's more like an event that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happens isn't it even a public holiday </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> no i feel like it's a mutual agreement </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> amongst everyone to get drunk in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> park yeah that's kind of what it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty much pretty much but it's yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like because the sucker are only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> around for about a week and some maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes not even a week later a couple </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of days yeah uh people go out and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> celebrate by just sitting under a tree </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having a picnic under the sucker tree do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you think it's [ __ ] great do you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think it's worth because i know a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people who are like i want to come to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japan during that time do you think it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> worth coming japan just for it i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i think if it's the first time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you come into japan i think it's worth </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i think now because we've lived in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan for two years we're kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're kind of like used to it but i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like seeing hanami for the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and seeing like all like the cherry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> blossoms just like falling off the trees </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you have like the ground is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally covered in cherry blossoms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like everywhere i think that's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty cool like a couple of years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely just nodded to you saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that right now it's like oh it's like in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the end like you literally walk through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a park and it's lit it is literally like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> every [ __ ] anime scene where like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] cherry blossoms yeah the cherry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> everywhere watering down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> still looks dark it looks dope as [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know what it is japan that just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like so aesthetic but it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just the perfect aesthetic i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> japan is like kind of aesthetic all year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> round but i'd say like the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> aesthetic is probably during the suckers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i'd say if you are gonna do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely get out of tokyo because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> every single hanami place in tokyo like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every single park that has the cherry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> blossom trees is this packed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah you you will be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like because we met two years ago we did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a small one yeah and we had to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a corner of dirt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in the park right next to the road like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it was the only literally the only spot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> left in this massive where did you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go like shinjuku no we we're in uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> saitama yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah right and it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it was rammed as well it was so full </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because what what people normally do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here in japan is during the cherry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> blossom week or season or when they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> blooming uh people go to the park they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> get like a kind of like a picnic area um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they just get [ __ ] pissed in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> public right right it's great i'd say go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like when you come to japan definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do like a week in tokyo and then if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're you know if it aligns with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> hanami do a week somewhere else where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you can then go and celebrate the hanoi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i feel like doing because you can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> really explore japan in one week i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think no you can't you kind of explore </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tokyo in one week yeah feel i've been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> here for like two years now and i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> barely explored japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how is hanami in like hakuna you said oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean it's great because it's like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> mean hakuna is still you know very much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a tourist destination but i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> compared to like shinjuku going or like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yogi park it's like yeah you don't get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> any space at all no absolutely no space </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> at all and i mean like i i guess as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like in hakuna and a lot of places in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hakone they've definitely like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> positioned a lot of like uh onsens and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like yokans and stuff like that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> around the sakura and like around all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the aesthetic parts of hakone so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it was great i mean like we we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> stayed in like an airbnb that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> overlooking uh like a bunch of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sakura trees on the lake and yeah in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> distance you could see mount fuji and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like the most like aesthetic [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> harmony that i ever had and i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what it's it's kind of worth to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> go all the way out there sometimes to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like get a little bit of peace of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mind right because otherwise it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be like you'd be rubbing shoulders with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the person next to you being like look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the pedal over there oh my god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it wasn't the people it was like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] kids running around i mean like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting pissed is great getting pissed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with like a bunch of like five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> six-year-olds running around you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> playing football or whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not exactly like the best kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> vibe to get pissed drunk if you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sitting like where i am now you are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> probably like this close to someone as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well yeah someone else is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> matt and picnic set well you see you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> stayed in airbnb have you stayed in many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> airbnbs in japan um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not really yeah i mean because like 90 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of them got [ __ ] axe yeah so for the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> olympics uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the japanese government changed the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rules around airbnbs basically just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gutting them and making it so that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had to make it you did follow a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they basically made it so you had to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> follow hotel rules like you had to have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the fire escape and like the floor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lit up to the yeah it's they made it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they basically made the rules impossible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on purpose where you couldn't turn a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> profit like reasonably basically because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i have stayed in an airbnb yeah i stayed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in one as well the first time i visited </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was super cheap you get like what do </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> what like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was really cheap like 150 bucks yeah </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah that's kind of weird i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know if i count that as an issue i love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> those things yeah it's like a vitamin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drink it's a vitamin drink that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely not healthy but it's in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> same like section as like oh you mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you mean the japanese ones yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like a glass it's like a glass thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's got a really satisfying pop yeah </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> kind of like sweet drink i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who because i don't really drink genji </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> drinks but i love this thing yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> any drink yeah i don't know if it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> placebo but yeah i mean it definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tastes a lot better for my body than a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> red bull i think i don't feel awful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after drinking that yeah i think it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because now it's gone to the point where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if i have an energy drink it's literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to make me unable to sleep for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that night and it never used to be that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way normally i could like down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five energy drinks or whatever and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> be fine the night so you have the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> opposite problem i don't i don't get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything from them anymore all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's cause you're doing like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five cups of coffee a day i'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] surprised maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i can quit any time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just replace coffee with energy drinks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> all right yeah exactly yeah i quit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coffee i only just drink a lot of tea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i stopped drinking them yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> tea also has caffeine yeah much though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't he have more caffeine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> without like the tea it like itself if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you just eat tea yeah but i like the tea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> leaves yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> tea if you would just eat the tea leaves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh okay like if you would just eat it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you'd be taking more caffeine but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no one does that sorry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you said that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eat tea you know what i mean british </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> people be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't drink it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sure if you just like [ __ ] just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know powder the coffee on your food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever get caffeinated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why did you start caring about what you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> were putting in your body </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i still don't care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to stop thinking about that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> off okay i i care when i can feel the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> effects does that does that make sense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> does that make sense no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you mean like the immediate effects yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like if like oh i have a tummy ache </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately afterwards but i probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> shouldn't put it in my body yeah so like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can just tell we're about to get on an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> american topic this is gonna you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what i mean like i feel like america's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna die </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> okay no like there was a point i i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like where you could just put any [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in your body and you could just not feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> any like after effects at all it would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like go away after a while but now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i have gotten to a point where for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> example i try to keep a healthy sleep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> schedule because if i don't get a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> healthy sleep schedule i just feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] and i don't know i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i just feel like there was a point when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i didn't care about a sleep schedule and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it didn't matter so you like discover </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> sleep for the first time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i think your sleep schedule you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you've got [ __ ] to do that's right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's it right that's it when you've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got [ __ ] to do and you want to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> productive like not like waking up late </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> actually affects that and i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yo um i never thought about this when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was a uni student because i did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> everything at 4am in the morning and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> still got a passing grade yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i'm jealous of youtubers who get </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> they just gotta take a break they just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get to like [ __ ] off for four months you </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> joey said a joke is a joke please don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cancel jerry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i was just thinking about it because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you saying that like oh um my mom made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> many jumps and logic there um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you were saying oh yeah well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've got [ __ ] to do but when you you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know when you where you as youtubers you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always have [ __ ] to do because there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no vacations you can't just take a month </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people take a month off for a mental </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> health break which is like i say with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> inverted commerce because it's kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> become a cliche now even though it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very important and beautiful they just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] need it but you know it's sad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because if you get cancelled you almost </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get a better vacation because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's people still talking about you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> while you're gone and people like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> searching about you and making videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about you like i know that sounds awful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know it's not great but like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are still getting way more traffic yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> than he would be just taking a break </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right so if you do something kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> semi semi bad you know just something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do something light you know just just do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something like oh just i don't know just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fart on a dog or something i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just something that's like not too bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's something that you can you'll get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> backlash for but isn't really that bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can just come back from in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> month you know what i mean and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll get your cat vodka </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah perfectly fine you know yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> starting to think i should get a pet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay that's a joke </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> trash taste getting cancelled speed run </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> severity yeah the people get like quite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> severe yeah it's quite bad but i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> noticing more and more a lot of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if they haven't really done anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> criminal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they just kind of like bounce back super </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> easily i mean there are some people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> did cheat about that david was kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> criminal to be fair let's be honest yeah </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> around the house and just hang out and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like yeah damn is this what like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weekend feels for every other i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> literally experiencing a weekend for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> first time in my life i was like oh my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> god this is f i should do this more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> often yeah [ __ ] like i think for us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> especially the last few months have just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> been super [ __ ] busy with us building </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this set and having to like film a bunch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of episodes to get ahead i remember we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had like what like this two-week period </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where it was like we finished building </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the set then we filmed a trash taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> episode every day for like yeah it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like we had a recording session with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> either trash taste or like a netflix </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shoot or some kind of some kind of other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> live stream every day for like two weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> without any breaks on weekends or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> anything that was brutal that was like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was i was like close to burn out there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i do film my schedule lap on planet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i'm i'm jealous of you right i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> jealous of you the most because you you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> view streaming as a down time i'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> wish [ __ ] i wish my down time could be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i wish i could get paid i wish i could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> be paid for my downtime i'll just enjoy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it and that's like people always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> complain at me like oh make a stream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> schedule i'm like nah bro because i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i just do whatever i want but i just i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stream often like yeah around the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> times but people are like yeah why do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you need a stream schedule you literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stream like three or four times a week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because i i think to myself i most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of the time whether i decide to stream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is normally on the day that's normally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like if i've worked too much or maybe i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to just chill out you know maybe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've got too much work to do so i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> want to do it because the moment i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> commit to a schedule is when it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> working yeah yeah exactly if i say i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have to stream at this day it's work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and then that's why i won't stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having fun so well i mean like i guess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for you it's like good because you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that one game that you can stream which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you also just play casually yeah i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i think when you cause that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right but it's it's right now but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm you know i'm like so i mean i guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> totally my strengths </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by the time this is out you would have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> found out the winner of the tournament </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> arc 2 which we are currently being part </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of yeah well we are because we were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recording these advanced because uh me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and gonna plan to get to the uk as we've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mentioned so uh yeah we're quite far </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ahead right now but yeah we're in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> middle of the chess tournament so we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> playing a lot of chess recently yeah i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really enjoying um but yeah no i mean it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is i think when you are streaming it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very helpful to have at least one game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can come back to when you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like running out of ideas i think i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> think that's what i'm currently trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to find right now is that one game where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like the problem the problem is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my one game that i've just played a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like not very popular yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and whenever i play it everywhere yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and whenever i play everyone's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh he's obviously doing this because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a sponsored stream and i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like no i just just enjoy the game no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> one [ __ ] plays this game but i'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> play it i did notice that when i started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> playing apex uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> apex is probably the game i stream i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> streamed most um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that my viewership was quite much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> considerably lower than normal but i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like well no [ __ ] it i like this game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm going to keep playing it and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> after time it actually like went up to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the point where if i stream new games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> now it's normally lower than apex yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a built up like the follow-up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but i feel like you have to you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stick through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel like you also got very lucky as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> well because the apex did just have a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> massive boom in general yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because of like every v tuber under the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> shadows yeah yeah apex raid of shadows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i don't know why that was not even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> intentional i was just playing it and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then i started seeing every youtuber's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> playing i'm like whoa what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see like that's not going to happen with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my comfort game because my comfort game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is about 30 years old what's your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comfort game like any final fantasy game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah i'm just like like i can't i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> can't like [ __ ] stream final fantasy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 6 even though it's one of my favorite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> games of all time because no one's going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to [ __ ] watch it and it sucks you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know well would you even want to stream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your comfort games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean yeah because i think like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> again it's like apex with conor where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like it's just a comfort game right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you don't necessarily have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see it as work or like you don't have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> necessarily be like entertaining and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wacky and goofy and you know yeah try </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and hold an audience right like you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just play a game casually yeah as you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would normally do and people would just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> be there to watch you play it right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's different it's it's very different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to my normal streams as well i'd say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> depends on what i'm doing like you're a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot more quiet during your apex stream </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah definitely yeah because i'm i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> focusing on the game so it's like i talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in between stuff happening yeah um so it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> depends what's going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but that's why i like i like talking to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese people on there it's fun yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i'm trying to find more things that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i want to watch um that's that's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's i feel like i'm i'm more of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i like doing passive things rather than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> active things a lot of times in my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> downtime like the other day uh like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> few days ago i ended up watching all of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> loki for like the new marvel series it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually really [ __ ] good and like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't i'm not that invested in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> marvel franchise so i was like i'll just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put on one episode just see what it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about and i just ended up binging the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> entire thing and i was just like this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] amazing because it was only six </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> episodes but every episode is 40 minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> long so i basically just binged an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> entire season of anime just that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's how i think of things but it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't anime but it was an anime and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like damn how why can't i do this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with anime anymore [ __ ] man i miss that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so much i'm so busy now where i like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dread good stuff coming out because i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] yeah i gotta find tana watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this now see if only you could like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch loki on twitch right just use that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as your down time just have people watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just have watch parties yeah honestly i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> would love to have watch parties with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like different things i'm watching yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but obviously dmca </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> obvious reasons can't do that yeah um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like i know sydney her her </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> downtime thing is that she watches </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> horror movies and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how she finds so many [ __ ] horror </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movies to watch i didn't know this many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> horror movies existed she watches at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> least three new horror movies every week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> dude at least but the the successful of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> horror movies is like never ending it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> actually insane because i was never i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like i was never big into horror </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movies i don't really like horror movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i assume you guys aren't big fans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> either because none of it showed up on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> our three by threes no i don't like not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a single one there's some good ones but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's like it's not my favorite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> genre yeah yeah yeah um but she somehow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> finds so many shots huh shining is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really good shining's good i i like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shine like there's only a few horror </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> movies that i really like shiny's one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> them i've really because like my my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taste in horror movies is really niche i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think because i like kind of loved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> craftian horrors because i don't like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the usual like you know jump scares </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ghost paranormal stuff what's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> problem is that so much horrors jump </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scares now yeah it is it is cheap and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> easy to relax yeah that's i think that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why i'm such a big fan of like jinji ito </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that because it's really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the horror that i like is really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just the ones that really unsettle me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the macabre horror yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah no i i'm exactly like that like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like asian horror is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more my taste in horror because yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> again it's like you see like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you watch one paranormal activity you've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> basically seen them all how the [ __ ] did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> paranormal activity get so big it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because steven spielberg greenlitted he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> literally is that true yeah so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> actually read up on it because i had the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exact same thought i was like i saw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] the trail of a paranormal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> activity 73 and i was like yeah why are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there so many but i remember when it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it came out i was in school and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever everyone was like this is the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> scariest movie ever yeah it's so scary </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i know right and i was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone was like [ __ ] their pants </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> over it i remember because i was in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> university at the time and so i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> all right i'll see what the hype's about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because uh back then my roommates had a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watch party and then we watched uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> paranormal activity the first one and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything everyone was like jumping at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like the [ __ ] closet opening and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like i can literally see the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] string being used to open this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] door how is this scary what is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> going on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one remote press </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one that i thought wasn't bad was it the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> invisible men it wasn't that bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually is that what it's called oh the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> invisible man yeah the one about the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> invisible man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> sydney showed me that one i like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> one it was all right yeah i quite like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that one yeah the cinema is pretty good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i enjoyed that one i like um i watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the other day i finally watched um what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is it hereditary oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh how was that one because because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> missed out on it when it first came out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so i i kind of missed the initial hype </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because i was like western hearts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever for me yeah but then i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> felix showed me midsummer which is done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by the same guy arias yeah yeah and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like okay this is very creepy but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also kind of cool and experimental so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was like all right well i heard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hereditary was pretty good i watched it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's weird i don't i wouldn't i almost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> wouldn't even call it a horror film it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know it's you know what it feels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like it feels like if david lynch made a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> horror film yeah you know okay where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it's it's scary but it's also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as as we established in the previous </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three by three joey the big arts knob </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah david lynch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel like you just to make a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> horror movie you have to be [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you'll just be completely [ __ ] up to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> make any horror content i feel you need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to be [ __ ] up maybe in some aspects </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually uh me and sydney watched uh we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we had uh we had a night the other day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that we just kind of like binged part of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the final destination series </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the reason for that was because i kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of i kind of remembered my very first as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a teenager i love those films yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember the very first time i watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> final destination and was it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually in school right right um so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think i was like i think it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> middle school at the time so i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think around 12 13 years old and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know if the same thing for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> australia but you know like at the end </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of term in school right it's kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a free frog and the teachers it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like that period where it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the last two classes of the year or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something teachers just let you let you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do whatever the [ __ ] you want right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was that true in australia yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely it depends on the school but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah i think most schools it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm going on break in [ __ ] three days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah whatever yeah so it was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just like in the school thousand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just had a week period where you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just basically basically go to class and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every teacher would put on a different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> film or just like roll in the team yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just roll just roll on the tv and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone will watch a different film and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] ninety percent of the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it was shrek it was fun okay yeah okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just awesome </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah we watch shrek </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> good to know that that was just a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nationwide it's that time of year okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> end of year all right i guess it's shrek </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i remember this one class um one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of my classmates brought in a dvd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah right because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we were just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the teacher would ask what does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone want to watch and so this guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> samuel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he he brings out the dvd and he brings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out final destination and he was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is this is a film i think the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> entire class would want to watch and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's like yeah sure anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think we were like 12 at the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i had not heard a final destination at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the time but we're like yeah sure like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like you know anything to get us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> away from shrek or whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or whatever whatever the usual films </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we're watching right so he was like miss </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this i i think that the classroom would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watch would want to watch this and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nobody kind of like opposed it so and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the teacher had never heard of the film </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay so she was like dangerous so she </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was like this boy just had this dvd on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> him i i think he knew what he was doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah and so um so the film starts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> off in final destination and characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are always like it's it's i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the rating was like back then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but characters were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> already swearing but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think in pg films in like the uk even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you have like one or two swear words </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it can still be skewered towards like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the lower ratings if it's just like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or two swelling i think so yeah yeah um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so like characters so i remember the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> opening scene where they like get on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> plane and people start arguing whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um it's it's kind of sus because you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hear people obviously swearing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the teacher's just like uh samuel is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is is this suitable for this adrian is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah miss don't worry it's just the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> opening scene don't worry miss like just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't worry about it and she's like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay and so i remember the opening scene </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is where like i i think it's it's where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the plane crashes that's the first final </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> destination i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so a bunch of 12 girls just watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh watching this plane take off and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously um the plane starts to crash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh the the wing snaps and everyone's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] screaming it's terrifying right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the scene and then you see like blood </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> splatter and then you see someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting burned alive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immediate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immediately like the [ __ ] the teacher </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gets up aggressively like aggressively </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gets off to the tv doesn't even doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even switch it up unplugs the tv and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> goes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> samuel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get outside now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was my very first experience at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> final destination absolutely chad samuel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he was like he probably walked out i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like worth it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i remember one of them put like uh it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was an art class i remember this and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like the teacher was not tech savvy at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> all right and uh he put meat spin on all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the pcs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then took just unplugged all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> mouse and keyboards and he the teacher's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having a mental breakdown didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understand why he couldn't just like he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> was like [ __ ] hammering the keyboard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like why was it turning off and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> then i started hitting the monitor then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to turn the monitor off i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> even think he knew how to turn it off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then he didn't know how to turn it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off he didn't even think of unplugging </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it or anything so this was still playing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the whole time and then goes and gets </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> another teacher to come around it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why don't you turn it off he's like oh i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't know how he pressed the button to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> turn it off classic mead spin he's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meat spin and there's like these poor </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> trash taste and you were just telling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh why was i talking about goats wait </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is in an episode oh this wasn't an </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> all just like people doing horrible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> things yeah like people stuff yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty sure you can find way worse stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the internet now anyway so yeah of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> course you do yeah but that back back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when we were growing up this was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the [ __ ] you'd like show your mates </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] hey there's this really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> cool thing if you google meat spin oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two girls one cup </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is still scarring to this day yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> remember watching that yeah going back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to horror movies like i would like to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> find </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a horror movie i really liked has anyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> seen annihilation the one with natalie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> portman </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that sounds so familiar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh there was a plot breakdown so the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> plot breakdown is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um there's an alien artifact or some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> artifact from space that crash lands </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um somewhere somewhere in the world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously and it creates this kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> force field barrier right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh you can easily enter the barrier </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you can't get any like electrical </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> signals or any like communications </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> uh this features natalie portman and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> hawkeye </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no you're thinking of uh a rival that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was the one which i really like arrival </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i hope that was good that was good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's not a horror movie though oh i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> thought it was okay yeah i mean it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just a sci-fi oh okay yeah i just i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wanted more sci-fi stuff which which i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think is why i was really going to loki </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they can't get any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sorry they can't get any signals in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there so they don't know what's going on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in there and every team that they've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sent in there just never finds their way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out so they really they literally don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know what's going on in there and this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> force field is slowly slowly expanding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so eventually it will cover the whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> earth so they need to kind of stop it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right they need to kind of figure it out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they send this team of scientists to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> investigate what's inside there and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of won't spoil it from there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because a lot of sounds good a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> weird things happen and it's not like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not so what i liked about it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it was just like really it's really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> terrifying but not because of any jump </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scares just some of the ideas within </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this you know with some of the ideas of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what happens to the people within this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> circle are just like really unsettling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and really terrifying it is very much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a kind of like jinjito ideas where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just really weird kind of ideas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you don't you kind of have to have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i don't know what kind of mind you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> need to come up with these things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh but it's that i i would like more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> horror like that and i don't know where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to start with recommendations which is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why if anyone if anyone knows any then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm all open what was that film with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> woman nicholas cage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's like numbers and there's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kid who like has the knowing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know how i remember that's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one have you seen that movie yeah i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> seen that movie what is it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i can't remember but i remember being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> really [ __ ] stupid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> look at nicholas cage like he like stops </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like a plane crashing or something no i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think because i watched this as a kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i remember he i i think it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something to be a series are we just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like trying to poorly recollect movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like like what's this movie i want that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like this thing okay okay i'm going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> try and recreate this movie from what i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have how do you remember this perfectly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um because okay so as a kid in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> summer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh this is going on another tangent now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so my summer's considered consisted of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me going to thailand and me spending </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like six weeks in thailand and obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i wouldn't have something to do every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> day so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like part of my childhood childhood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> experience is going to the mall </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and go and in like and just like in in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically every southeast asian country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there'd be these stands where you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these like dvd covers and you just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you just like flip through the covers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just choose which movies you'd want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to see and some of them weren't out on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> dvd yet officially right so you just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> flip through them you just want i want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that one i want that one i want that one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and one that one and then they'd ask you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to uh go go walk in the mall for like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> good half an hour to an hour and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll call you i'll tell you when your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> purchase is ready right which was a 100 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> totally legal of course of course um but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you all know there's nothing very strict </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> copyright yes yes yes yes um so like my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> summer would just be basically watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> blockbuster hollywood movie that came </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out that year because that that i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looked forward to it because i could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> literally pick every film through this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> day knowing is still the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and to this day i still remember knowing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why that's honestly why 50 first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dates almost went went on my 3x3 because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'd watched that so many times what are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you going to say because of knowing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like what is this episode because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only one movie that tops no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so like i've watched so many of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> these films which are now what i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> classify as like airplane films because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now i would not watch them in any other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> circumstances unless i was on an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> airplane um but of knowing was one of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the films that i was stuck inside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> indoors in thailand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> had nothing to do but just watch films </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and uh from what i remember it was they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think it had to do with like a time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> capsule that was buried ages ago oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah that was it and there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a number like a cipher or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah there was some kind of cipher </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> numbers or something that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> predicted the apocalypse or something um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that sounds dumb and nicolas cage was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just like i see the future i see what's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> going to happen the number is basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff nicholas cage things happen yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and then uh the world literally ends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i think it's a solar flare that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh kills everyone uh spoilers if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ever wanted to watch knowing i wanted to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watch if if he ever wanted to watch the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> masterpiece that is nicholas cage's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> knowing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how did we get on this topic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just talking about movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is that a horror movie i i think it is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> horror it's supposed to be a horror it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not as it is horrible i'm looking up </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> was it was it was pretty felt like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> horror it was pretty horrible what ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> happened to nicolas cage i know he's </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> here a little bit and then i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't i don't feel educated enough to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> talk about it but </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> a lot but one of my favorites is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone edited </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> edited him like uh during like a driving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> scene or something and it's just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> him like getting into a car and just it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> out of context it looks like he's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> play driving like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's so hard to describe but it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you gotta watch it and another another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing is just nicholas cage slowly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> losing his mind as well yeah well have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you ever seen no one i think sorry yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like him slowly getting more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and more crazy as the clip goes to the </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> like frankly as a man i enjoy watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> other channels </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> being able to sit there and enjoy that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know come on man what's wrong you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know man it's just blokes hanging out i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like yeah that happens a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guys like that in the uk though you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's always there's always one guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that i feel in every guy i feel i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lad's culture is definitely like a thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in the uk which is like kind of i'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> save in australia yeah yeah do you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> have lads culture in australia your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> friends who would be like that if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> try if you're oh yeah absolutely like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know like because i went to a boys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> school as well so it was even more so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like just macho and security </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> everywhere where you know you'd be out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's after school it's kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> toxic yeah yeah i didn't and they'd just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> be like you know a girl from like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know a nearby girl school or whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah oh you you oh you should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> totally smash her bro you should totally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> smash it i'm just like i'm not you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i try to be confrontational because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they're your friends right but i also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> try and i'm not going to sit there and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> be like dude that's pretty you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's pretty not okay that's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's pretty it's pretty [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i've had arguments with my friends about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it as well or i'll just be like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's uh that's kind of homophobic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but that is homophobia yeah exactly why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you think because we spend so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time on the internet that we've just had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like more awareness about this kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> culture and stuff i think so because you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know a lot of my friends would never be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they're not i don't think they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would ever be like i hate gay people or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> anything like that right but also you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to understand where that comes from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you if there's something where you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can watch a normal sex scene but you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't watch a gay sex scene yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why is that like what's going on there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're a normal person surely who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't give a [ __ ] you'd have no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> problem to either right yeah you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe you would find one harder than the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> other but surely you wouldn't have a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> problem right yeah i don't know if this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is too much for trash taste viewers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean like just because you're okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with watching a sex scene doesn't mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you need to be like into it no that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what i like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> don't have to actively dislike it but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you don't have to like turn it off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or like go in the other room yeah you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know what i mean like there's a point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can just sit there and be like all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right it's not for me but i'm not going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be disgusted but it's part of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> story right yeah it's like this is what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it is yeah that's what i was saying i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like you know if it's part of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> plot it's what it is man like they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh it's just kind of weird isn't it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like i'm like is it weird explain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how it's weird don't watch brokeback </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mountain if that's the case </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's literally what that movie is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about i was like i was like that's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> problem though you think it's weird like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not like it's like it's not it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not weird that people [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> just a lot of the times especially like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in loud culture people just have never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought about this too deeply because </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> culture and i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as i've grown older i'm just like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is a kind of a toxic mindset in a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ways you know it's uh it's it's very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> uh because i think the problem is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they don't really talk about it they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't really talk about their don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really talk about their feelings or like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really think about things too deeply </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because yeah that's not a loud thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's considered weak yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> considered weak yeah you're not an alpha </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> male if you talk about your feelings and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] and also you know they don't really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> have conversations like this yeah they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> don't talk about it so normally when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i've when it's been saying that i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spoken about people it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially in like where i'm from it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the first person who's ever been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like now why do you feel that way about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now why is it that it makes you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uncomfortable you know what i mean like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so what do you mean by that yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's not on that and i was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know and i've had like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> confrontations about it because it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah they get very defensive about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it yeah like they feel like oh [ __ ] wait </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is he trying to say that i'm i'm in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wrong for feeling this way yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like well no i'm not trying to but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like why are you feeling that way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe i think maybe you just want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> have a discussion about it maybe maybe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> oh like maybe look at like what's going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's funny because like some of the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of insecure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> feeling of people i've ever met are like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the uh like some of the like biggest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> lads i've ever seen like the prop like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> jim bros who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes it's it's insecurity sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's uh it toxic masculinity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes homophobia it's like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever it is it's like get to the core </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of it if that's what's bothering you you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> can't watch brokeback mountain without </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> being disgusted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a great movie that's a great move </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> all i'm saying is if you're a guy don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be afraid to talk about your feelings </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with other guys i feel like i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't have that when i was growing up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i thought i thought that it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the mentality where if i did this with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my bros then i was the weak one you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's not what that's not what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> bros do to each other yeah you know and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i i wouldn't say we're like sjw or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> anything like that i just i don't know i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> don't want to discriminate i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly why should you you know i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know exactly my personal opinion i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sure that i'm i'm no doubt there's some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> viewers of trash tastes like i can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> believe this they've spoken about this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> issue and stuff but i mean that's i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a sensitive time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff that i would talk about yeah but i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean there's some things that are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> sensitive and there's some things where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like no that's just straight up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wrong yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of course yeah i mean there's you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's some things where i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i think we i think we should talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about this and i think you know it's i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not toxic at all to at least start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a conversation because i think a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of the times a lot of people just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> haven't really never really put any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought into it and they correctly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't yeah they grew up in a culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they grew up in a lifestyle and that has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put them in a position that challenges </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the way they think yeah and if someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> does feel uncomfortable with us talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about this topic or hearing that idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> makes you uncomfortable i would say just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like don't get angry about it don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't you know react to it just think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like all right just turn off trash taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> go watch no no no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just think why does it like why does it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get you angry like what about it like if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like a whole religious thing all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> right fine that's that's that's your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> problem about like i don't know like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i cuz like i just feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's better now for at least people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are like i guess on the internet and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially on social media because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people are talking about this more often </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah which is good but i still like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they're they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you forget sometimes that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we are not i i don't even know if we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the majority you know because you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> every time i go home i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's hard to tell because we're i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so ingrained in obviously our jobs are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> surrounded with the internet and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> surrounded with you know people who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think like me yeah that i it's weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever you go to like go back home see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> family </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> see friends from back home and you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like wow everyone thinks exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the same everyone has not changed much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at all because they just there's no one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in their community or in this group of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> friends that are exposed to the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> thing as we are so yeah no totally yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because obviously on my channel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very pro-lgbtq but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously going back home it's not a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing that's spoken about much it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of it depends who you ask really i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think now more than before definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah with how the world's just changing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah my parents pretty good with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it i i always try to educate when i can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> try and tell them about it yeah like i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would like to think most of the time it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just pure ignorance and oh totally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> especially in small towns yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know obviously not everyone is on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the internet all the time everyone's in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a big city you surrounded so it's you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know a lot of the time they just don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come across it they're just like oh it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> a that guy's very funny on tv and he's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's what it's like that's what my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> parents are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but i mean you know it's uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's i mean it's everywhere right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> now so it's like it's good yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just iron him it's uh it sucks that it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of those things that it even has to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be somewhat controversial </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to talk about right and we've already </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spoke about trash taste i'm sure that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some people will be alienated by it but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it sucks that even has to be something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that alienates people yeah you know when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it should affect people are gay get over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you sometimes forget heath leisure is a </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> australian </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> oh okay yeah do you think he's british </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> it in the uk no one says it in the uk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i've never heard that any british person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they said it literally sounds like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something out of harry potter no it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> cicada </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> have you ever heard a british person say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cicada no i have never heard a british </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> person say i'm saying now i'm getting it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in my head now yeah i know it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like you have to rewind that right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now i remember because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we literally we literally had a netflix </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shoot uh where we had to talk about like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> summer anime things i put zakat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought cicada or cicada was spelt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> c-i-r-c-a-d </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah he literally wrote sir </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sir </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and i did and i didn't know you got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i thought cicada had a r in it this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> entire time and apparently it doesn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um it's cicada now yeah but yeah i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've said this before they never fix you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i remember when i first moved japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i literally had gone my entire life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thinking that every cicada sound effect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in every anime was just a stock sound </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> effect right because they all sound </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly the same you watch like one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> summer anime episode and you're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're just using the same [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sound effect as the other anime right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i didn't realize until i moved to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japan that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cicadas just all sound exactly the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] same yeah i thought it was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a [ __ ] audio jungle stock sound </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> effects no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know how they sound so similar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's literally just been hardwired into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their brain to be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sound like this at this exact interval </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah to the point where i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sitting at home one night um or one day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i literally thought i had the tv on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> playing a random anime and i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> realize that just the window was open </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i literally like went to my living </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> room to turn off the tv because i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like i'm not no one's watching anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lo and behold it was just the window and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i couldn't tell the difference between a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> tv stock sound effect and the real life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> have you seen them flying yeah they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] massive they're terrifying yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i was outside uh the trash taste office </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh i was just walking listening to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> music just jamming you know and one flew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in my [ __ ] face and i [ __ ] smacked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i smacked it and i felt really bad cause </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it hit the woman in front of me on her </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and her back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you literally just tossed this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and she turned around i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] [ __ ] playing ping pong yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just hit it i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what's scarier is when they land on your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> balcony but like like they don't say but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you think they're dead they just don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> move yeah they just like kind of pop and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just flop down you're like oh is he dead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you touch it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah there's one outside my door so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> opened the door yeah and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scarier than any horror film because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just opened my door you don't expect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that yeah there's nothing in my door you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never expect a jump scare at your door </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> why why do they make noise what are they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to this on a mate or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] say why are they i think they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like don't they like rub their legs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> together to make that sound or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i think it's like a violin yeah like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the world's shittiest violin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah cause apparently they can only mate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> during like a very short period of their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um during the summer yeah during the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> summer so they're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're [ __ ] horny as [ __ ] man they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> need to [ __ ] they're the lads of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> insects yeah yeah and then they [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> once and they die and then that's it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just their entire life they they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> live for that one [ __ ] and then they die </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make as much noise as possible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i came too early died </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> honestly i can think of worse ways to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> die yeah than having like a not so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> amazing that you're like all right life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is peaked now i am </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> death initially some people die from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cows you know that's for [ __ ] sake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm bringing this back right because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after that i i realized god was like how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do people die from cows i'm like god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like four tons what do you mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how do people die from cows like so many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> people in the suburbs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you can die from cows but you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> die from anything that's like four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] tons from any like heavy animals </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why should not make me look like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an idiot for saying a cow can kill you a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> cow [ __ ] kill you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just because a cow can kill you doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean that you know probably if you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> killed by a cow you're doing something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stupid right yeah that's just that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just my opinion right you'd have to try </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really [ __ ] hard to die from a cow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> most most ways people die are from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stupid ways god as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> believe it or not i remember a statistic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in japan where it's like more people in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> japan die from vending machines and they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do shark attacks oh well yeah that makes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sense yeah right how from shaking the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> vending machine and landing on you and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> dying okay well that's just idiots being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> idiots you deserve that if you're sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what i mean it's the same thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with a cow like you're not gonna be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> walking through the [ __ ] panic and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> then suddenly cow's like let me come and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> squish you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> also very very i think they can bite you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> at all oh yeah um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're strong enough to uh push a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> vending machine on yourself yeah why are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you wasting all that talent you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what i mean like how do you get the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> vending machine to fall on you it can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be easy do you jump on it like why are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people doing this i i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you cannot you have you tried moving a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> vending machine it is not easy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you really have to be committed to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this stupid act like you really are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> admitting like all right i'm breaking a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sweat today like this is how i'm gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> take it off the yeezys for this one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what i'm saying about dying dying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> from cows you know why why why [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> try push like lying under a cow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or just like i'm standing behind a couch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just go swim in shark infested water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> apparently i think you you know i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've more chance of dying via the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cow honestly um have you ever seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enough live league videos people [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with animals to realize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> watch live link i don't know you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just casually sit down and watch live no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but sometimes i think i'd rather watch a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> horror film on facebook or twitter and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> one gets on there somehow and you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how i don't know i'm just happy i'm a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> widow yeah you just see like uh you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a monkey punching a man or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> something i don't know what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what wait what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sure he does retweet some of those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> questions she just sees [ __ ] and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like people like [ __ ] around with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> monkeys and then the monkey just beats </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> them up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly like if i see the live link </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> logo that's like a i should probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there is a worrying amount of people who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think that like they can just like do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever they want their animals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's normally like like third world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> countries and it's like scary because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like [ __ ] with like a monkey </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then the monkey just beats them up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like well i mean fair enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what did you expect yeah you kind of had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the right you know in court i would i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> would i would fight anderson you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're likely [ __ ] with the smartest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> animal yeah like because like i'm very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> wary whenever i see anything live like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i've seen enough [ __ ] up [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on the inside it's also a meme i've seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> people put live league on them like meme </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so now i'm like i'm not sure if it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> meme or not it's it's like playing games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like reddit 5050 or whatever it's called </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right that's the only that's the only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time i've seen enough lively tower where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just like yeah no nothing good comes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out of live sometimes it comes on and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like this is intriguing enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where i don't think i can stop watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now like the the premise i'm hooked i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know man i very quickly pulled </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them yeah i'm just like you guys have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more willpower than me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when i see the premise or the first one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> second the video i'm like damn i can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> turn it off now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is that wrong with me i feel like that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bad i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm i'm just wired to click bait i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> monkey brain activates right your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> curiosity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is you spelling uh circada incorrectly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah circada i realized like the other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> day i'm like [ __ ] i can't spell [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> without autocorrect anymore </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> my spelling is so bad without </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> autocorrect yeah that's pretty much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something i realize now when it's not on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i just kind of like type [ __ ] and i know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that it will fix it for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i just type fast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean i i'm i got something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> similar as well where i'm like i can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do mental arithmetic anymore like i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally like what like i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> oh what's uh nine times eight and i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get out the calculator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i'm so reliant i should do it but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it'll take me yeah 20 seconds i can do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it but it requires thinking and i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i'm not all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there you go okay i had to think about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> graduating masters in engineering by the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> way yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what was your method of getting that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because the nine times table is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> easiest yeah that's what i would i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the nine times nine is 81 then just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minus eight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that that's that's way too complicated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> even if there's an even easier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> anything times nine is super [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> easy i should have done that i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know no i mean i i don't really have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> system it's just figuring whatever your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brain is wired to do fast right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well for me if it's nine times eight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then it's like well eight is so it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> starts with a seven because whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're timing by nine is always one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> digit below yeah and then the two digits </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh sums up to nine am i i never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> understood you know how every time you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> would ever have like a new math teacher </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they would always teach you that weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way of solving a plus and a minus yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean and they're like right so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're gonna add 425 to uh 522 and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they're going to do right so we're going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to add the four to the five easy it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> great that now you know i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do you really need to write this down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> can we just like can we just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there's always like the like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just the really obscure ways to do it as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> well where it's like there's got to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> an easier way yeah yeah all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all right so when you bring the one over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> pull out your dictionary yeah or it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> would be like dividing by and they would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have this weird ass timetable or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something to do it and i'm like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feels so convoluted why don't why not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like figure out some other methods </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like teacher when am i ever going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> divide 973 by 67 like i'm not i'm never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> going to i'm never going to go and count </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> down i don't need to know this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every every single like yeah like it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> great that you if you can do that with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your with your mind but there's a party </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trick there's absolutely no setting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you are ever not going to be using </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a calculator and even if you are they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> will not allow you to do that because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they won't trust you you should be using </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a calculator for good practice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> even if you could divide yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> insane numbers that people like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not it it's good for like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> estimates when you're talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> engineering terms you're like okay well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> could maybe you try this much no i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think they just just off the top of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> head that doesn't seem right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's good but in general like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know those exams you know it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> funny how like mental arithmetic has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just become become kind of like a party </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trick yeah like you there's there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always like you always see that one guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every so often where you get the you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like the bill and they can just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> divide exactly the right amount in their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> head yeah but but it's also like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shittiest type of party trick because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the party trick that you do and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nobody believes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and people check it anywhere either way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like nah let me put the calculator </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> numbers now that is just my life but yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly the same spelling now where i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just i could not live without </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> autocorrect and i don't know i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's do you have those words that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just you you know what they look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like but you're like i just can't bother </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to learn how to spell it right you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what i mean i just want necessary i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> literally about to say that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is the one where i'm like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> honestly cannot remember which is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> two seas 2s yeah i just typed two s's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know i just got no i'm pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sure the one for me that always [ __ ] me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> up that i still never get right is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guaranteed yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like is the u in there is there an a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in this is it guaranteed or is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guaranteed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is what i just i don't care i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> haven't like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> necessarily i'm just like i'm pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sure it's two s's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no it's not is it it's two s's i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know maybe it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> n-e-c-e-s-s-a-r-y right yeah i'm pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> sure it is but yeah i already hold on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> let me check </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i'll never get out of the autocorrect i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just type and then click yeah it's that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> one yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but i think the thing about spelling is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that it doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end of the day spelling is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> irrelevant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end of the day you know you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> spell word wrong and people will still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> get like the meaning of the word most of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the time right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't there this phonetics yeah i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> haven't you seen like the video where if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you put the first letter right and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> last letter right you just mixed it up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on the internet i've seen that yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you've seen the ballerina that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spins the other way too gone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> have you seen the dress that's blue and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> green gold oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i remember that oh my god i completely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> forgot about that the internet was on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fire for a week unnecessarily over a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] dress i remember meme culture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but i remember that was like the hot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing back then back in the day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i knew i knew that dress meme went too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> far when people were like all right so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went into photoshop and i got the color </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i can confirm the hex digits that it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is in fact blue and gold what wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there that like audio </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that one oh yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah i remember that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i just saw that i was like who cares </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i i felt like after the whole dress </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> debacle it felt like everyone was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looking for the next thing that everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> interpret differently interpret </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> differently and i just didn't give a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] that was a nice meme that lasted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> three days yeah i remember like the only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what what they called the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> audio </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like audio illusion audio illusion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the it's actually it's not really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an audio illusion it's just did you ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did you guys ever do like the uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> frequency test where you have to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> test your frequency </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i remember i was fancy i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my frequency was like so [ __ ] good as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a kid and i thought i'm never gonna lose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know like dude as a kid do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ever did you ever get that point where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i grown up told you that this is gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happen to you when you grow up yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as a kid you're just like that's never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to happen to me it's never going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to [ __ ] happen to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember the first time i felt old was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first time i did the second time i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> did did a frequency test when i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mid-20s and i'm just like this isn't the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> same number as i remember as a kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the grown-ups are right i'm getting old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wait wait so is the frequency test like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the how much you can hear is that the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> one yeah so like the better your hearing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the higher the frequency oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah generally when you get around to 30 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it starts to get a lot worse yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean doesn't like who the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> needs to hear like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> high kilohertz i mean i i immediately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> felt that like because you know in like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some arcades in japan no yeah i like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that keto tone that like stops like uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> animals from coming into oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every time we walk past like an arcade </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with like a bunch of friends they'll be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh [ __ ] i'll be like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i legitimately don't it's that it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> actually an advantage here yeah right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because sydney sydney can hear it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i can't anymore yeah right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> apparently it hurts i'm just like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know apparently like in a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shops in japan they just play this like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i can't describe it i think isn't it you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> teenagers i've also heard it's to stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> birds from flying cats and cats okay can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you hear a connor yeah i can hear it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay what does it sound like i was gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> describe what it was and i realized i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> never been here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i just realized i've never heard of an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uncomfortable ring in your ears </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is that if they've just put this high </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> frequency alarm or ring to stop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> birds mosquitoes animals and loitering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know which one it's actually for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> might be is it for humans or animals i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know apparently it's for both </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because you can hear it as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably should have picked a lower </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> frequency though because it doesn't work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you've just got [ __ ] hearing then you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just immune to it like well it's funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to stop like kids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay okay that's uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've never been able to hear it though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> even even when i was a kid yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've been listening to like music for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i think there's so many concerts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where my ears just got [ __ ] you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna be like 14 what why are you saying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me god i'm still like that yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> true you are your hearing is really bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no but i talked about on the podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember i was like because when we went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to go do the health checkup and i got an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a for my hearing and then i realized oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't have bad hearing i just don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> listen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you're just [ __ ] dumb yeah i just i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just don't care about what you're saying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes but i just shut it out true </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> true that's what it is yeah boys have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any fun plans for the summer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what i miss </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um this is like the first time in my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> life where i've just not lived near a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> body of water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you're surrounded by water what do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you mean we're literally an island </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> country no but like we're we're in tow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we're in tokyo right yeah and i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the closest thing is like tokyo bay yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like part of part of the summer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> experience for me is just going to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beach somewhere and just like having it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> having a nice chill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know beer or something and haven't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been able to do that for the past two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> years and i've really i've really missed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that experience i mean it doesn't really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> matter because like the beaches have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> been closed no exactly it doesn't matter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> anyway because i can't go to the beaches </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> anyway yeah like okinawa's on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> lockdown so i can't go there so just i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just doesn't feel like i've i've had the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> worst part of the summer experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which is just the [ __ ] blistering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> heat and haven't been able to just enjoy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the nice trapped in a concrete jungle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> all right yeah basically so what are you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> going to do for your summer then go on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know what can i do for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> summer is there anything fun you can do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the summer that doesn't involve a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> beach or a pool or any body of water </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> stay inside play video games that sounds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty pretty [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what you do in winter though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right both seasons both seasons all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seasons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because uh another thing is that uh we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get mosquitoes here in japan and we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah we do oh yeah yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> do you not get bitten no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lucky i never get them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> how would you not get [ __ ] i get eaten </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> alive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe my blood doesn't taste good i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know i've never had a mosquito </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> apparently it does depend on your blood </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> type okay i think it does because i get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bitten to [ __ ] whenever mosquitoes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i know i can be in an area where someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> will get bit in a ton i won't have any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on me i literally like god always tells </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> me yeah i literally laid outside on my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> balcony for like half an hour came </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> inside and i had like 10 bites on my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not even joking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't we just don't have any bugs that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are annoying because well you guys are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mosquitos no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you not remember when we were just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> chilling out in england in my garden i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just thought i got lucky </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i just thought like oh this is a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> stronger this is stronger blood type </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> somewhere in the vicinity that they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> going there's no mosquitoes no i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that guy because like i'm just that guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm i'm the bait right because is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> meme of like the blades falling down and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the guy covering yeah it's gone everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> else everyone else at the party yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause like if people hang out with me in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thailand or japan or whatever they get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> bitten less because i'm there i'm the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bait i i am what every mosquito goes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> towards and i don't know why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because because in thailand we have we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have this saying where um normally it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the mosquitoes go for the foreign people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's the foreign people who have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the sweet blood because the mosquitoes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> aren't used to their blood so that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so that was the [ __ ] life well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> technically i didn't grow up in thailand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so maybe there's some kind of truth to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it but apparently apparently if you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> never been beat well if mosquitoes are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> beaten by a mosquito is [ __ ] you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> what's going on huh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> coming to our neighborhood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i've never i've never get bitten by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> mosquitoes i'm so [ __ ] dude is it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a blood type thing i don't even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know apparently it's like a blood type </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> thing it's also like a skin thing as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well like certain skin like if you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like oily skin you're more likely to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bitten like that i don't know there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lots of theories out there i i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's literally just like if you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> unlucky you're unlucky kind of thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah pretty much beer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh yeah no apparently if you're you get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> uh you're more likely to get stung if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're drunk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is that true yeah apparently the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mosquitoes drunk i don't know that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> probably why they're like um guys come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> time for a sesh right because they get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> drunk in the blood right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> baby </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> drinking so i don't know what's going on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is there a reason why mosquitoes go for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> people more or less yeah it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like seven reasons yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know if any of that has actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> been like scientifically confirmed i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> feel it's just like it might be like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> little like coincidence it's not tasty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enough what the [ __ ] like what are they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like tasting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as well that's probably what i'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> tasty bro what i want to be tasty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't want to be tasty missing out i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> want to be tasty that's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mosquitoes are [ __ ] they're the worst </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they're the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nobody likes mosquitoes people they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> could be like the biggest animal lover </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the world and they see a mosquito and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] that little [ __ ] isn't like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the mosquito i think i read somewhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't the mosquito like the only animal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like the food chain where if you got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rid of them it just wouldn't change the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> food chain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know if that's an urban legend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but i hope it's true i think it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something like that because i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saying because like i think i looked it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> up because i was like because in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> australia we have a [ __ ] ton of flies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah during the summer right like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's [ __ ] horrible especially if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like out in the desert yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing but flies it's disgusting and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think i just thought to myself like man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i really just wish all flies just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> disappeared and then one of my friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like oh no like flies are like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really important to the food chain yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like there's a lot of animals that eat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> flies and that's all like yeah is there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> an animal where if we just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it just disappeared one day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would the food change still be intact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i think mosquitoes was one of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> humans probably oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> we were the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mosquitoes are [ __ ] useless things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because i mean they just [ __ ] carry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> diseases right like that's all they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> really do yeah they all they do is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> give malaria to people right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's probably like one other thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's probably one like really obscure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> species of spider or something that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could only feed on mosquitoes that would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> die out that's like integral for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> food chain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's always like that like no no this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> one animal that specifically eats this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> thing yeah how would you even eradicate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mosquitoes i would even go about that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know i don't ask the aussie they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] they've they've had like enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> problems trying to eradicate a certain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like the yeah toads right yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we had so we had the we have a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sugar cane in australia uh yeah during </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the 1800s and then cane flies were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> introduced which are these specific </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> breed of flies that only eat ca sugar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> cane and which completely wiped out a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sugar cane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we're like well [ __ ] we gotta get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rid of these flies because our food is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> getting [ __ ] up yeah and then someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like i've heard overseas there was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> specific type of toad called the cane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> toad that specifically only eats cane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> flies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone thought oh that's brilliant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's gonna solve all of our problems </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's introduce it so they introduced it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah all the cane flies disappeared but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then somebody realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] nothing eats cane toads </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're literally poisonous and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they're killing our native animals </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so now we just have a cane toad outbreak </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and you just can't get rid of it and we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just can't get rid of them dude it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like me playing chess they like suddenly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> thought one move ahead they were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they didn't plan anything else like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> feels like a vast oversight in like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> possible downsides yeah there's no pros </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and cons list someone was like bro my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mate's got one bring it over yeah let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just test it out sounds like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> beginning of like an always sunny skit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you you're just like oh let's bring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> over the cane toads and you just hit you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just see like the [ __ ] intro intro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> title gang choices gang introduces cane </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> toads to the to the food chain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but then again australia hasn't had very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much luck with uh animals i mean we had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> an emu war we lost yeah i'm like what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the [ __ ] is that about like i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hear every australian say that and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like that just sounds like i said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the great emu awards are the dumbest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] ever yeah they went to war against </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they lost and we lost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay do you want to explain that dude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> have you seen anemu no they're [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> terrifying can they kill you yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's australia everything can kill you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you should have known that one yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were they eating crops they're ruining </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> crops yeah they were ruining crops uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and and again like they kind of just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like over bred themselves to the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where there was just a [ __ ] ton of emus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just not enough space so they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> started invading farmland obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> farmers got pissed off about it so they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> tried to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get them out of it but obviously it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one man versus a [ __ ] two and a half </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meter bird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that can literally just kick you in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chest and kill you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so uh i think it went on for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a month or something i don't know how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> long it was it was a very short bit it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was a very short they wasted so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> money and like ammunition and time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> ammunition yeah yeah they were shooting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them shooting them they're like trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to gun them down yeah but they could bet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like but the emus were literally like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the spartans and they were like because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they would think it was like we we were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like xerxes army and the emus were the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> spartans and they're like oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they would like they weren't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fighting them but they were just they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just kept getting away yeah it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a looney tunes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they couldn't they couldn't kill them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like the benny hill theme for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> later mom straight they they had to wait </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and ambush them that's how they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> see it because they travel in flock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they go together in flocks and they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to ambush them and they're also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> extremely fun they can run like 60 70 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> now the moment they started opening fire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on them they just ran away and they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would only kill like you know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe yeah but they wasted like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hundred grand in ammo like ammo isn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> cheap i feel like because we're so used </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to war you think the ammo is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> affordable yeah like ammo is super </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> expensive yeah so they were just wasting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> hundreds of thousands of dollars on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bullets especially when that war was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happening as well as probably even more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> expensive and then one day someone was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's not worth it is it no it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> wave the white flag and then they just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> retreated and it was embarrassing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they just failed miserably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what is going on in australia i'm sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone who's like watched internet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> videos has heard about this yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this is a very internet video topic that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sounds like an internet historian skit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like yeah surprise he hasn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> made a video on it yet to be honest it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> great material </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean it's it sounds like on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> same level as like you know the 4chan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tumblr wars or something like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> yeah okay like nobody thought is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> really the best idea you know yeah no </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> one look at the [ __ ] shotgun they had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they were like we got this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> easy double </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> there christmas yeah christmas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i always hear about like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> summer it's like winter on australia but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what is winter for australia is it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> actually cold or do you just do you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> swap them do you just refer to winter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like hot summer is winter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no like july it's july july is the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> coldest time of year in australia but is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it winter it's july winter it depends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you are so in sydney it doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> get cold enough to snow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but if you drive for like two hours into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> canberra it snows like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i've been always under the impression of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the temperature that winter is the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of year like winter is always november </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to january </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry november to february february yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i guess that is winter is it the same in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> australia where you would refer to that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> period of winter no that's summer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but everyone else around the hottest the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hottest time of the the hottest day of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> any year is always uh new year's eve but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i always thought that it was like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> no matter what country you're in this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> winter yeah that's what that's what i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> thought it was winter it doesn't matter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the temperature what are you talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because winter is the coldest time of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> year for us that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> may to august yeah i know i just thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that winter as a concept was a time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> period not the season now it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely a season for us um because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like at least from my memory the hottest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> day of any year is always the last day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the year right so i i used to our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> family always used to go to that one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maids place who had that giant swimming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pool in his backyard because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're in that pool till about two in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the morning because it's so [ __ ] hot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember the hottest experience i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ever had in my life it was new year's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> eve yeah it was 45 degrees </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right obviously 45 degrees </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's in the pool even after the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sun went down it was like 41 degrees </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and it was so hot that i remember i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> went home like that morning it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 5 a.m and the fridge had just exploded </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from the heat like the fridge just </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> day just life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> happy new year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> my final message to the world yeah so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember my parents got super pissed off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally first day of the year they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went to the electronics store and bought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a new fridge because it just it just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> got busted from the heat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fridge is one of those appliances though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i'd be excited to get a new one i'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be like wow we can really mix it up with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the fridge this time well yeah but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i think it's good when you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> buy a fridge on your own accord right i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> disagree i prefer when my appliances </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> break </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because i'm like oh i have to spend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> money oh there's no oh whoa i guess i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have to get the most expensive one geez </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're upgrading you're like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] i've got a perfectly good one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't really need oh you start to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> starve with a cockroach fridge a washing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> machine or whatever or whatever it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it was a good appliance your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> standard of an upgrade it's quite long </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> like that [ __ ] just wanted to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get rid of his appliances that he wanted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to replace you and he framed it as a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] gift yeah so the person welcome </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's the kettle i don't know okay here </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> fancy but yeah in japan if you want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get rid of your appliances this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something that you should definitely be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aware of oh it's the worst um because if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> over like a if it's a big appliance so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like i think a hair dryer or bigger is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> considered as a big appliance right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to call it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so literally any applause you have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> call up the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> local government in your area and tell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> them you want to get rid of it and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've scheduled it right i i actually </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> uh we just kind of forgot it oh yeah we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just kind of because i thought i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> originally wanted to i originally had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the old kitchen table that we have yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on my balcony because i thought oh i </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> doing something outside and i need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something to like place it on yeah but </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> lacquer on it so i just started rotting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i was like all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i need to get rid of this now and it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my god dining tables do that if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> put them outside yeah yeah so uh but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's cool though because in my area </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can like register it through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like line oh that's cool but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the sucky thing is had to wait about i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know four weeks to throw it out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they were like oh you have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> schedule it ahead of time and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh okay maybe it's like always the third </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> thing it's like you know next week or </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> measurements of the thing yeah as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is i mean it's obviously i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> understand why but it's one of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things where it's like this is a hassle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i've never had to do in the uk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> before yeah so why am i measuring </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> like things like fridges or like washing </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> like there's usually a service where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they bring the new one they take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> away the old yeah that's true that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> true like we just got a new washing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> machine and they take away the oil and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they take away the oils like oh thank </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> god yeah yeah that's why you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whoever sold you the [ __ ] cockroach </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they were just like man they [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they were like 500 iq we got him to pay </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> pay the money just get someone to just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> come and get rid of them because it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> takes some if you want to get rid of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> your appliances it's probably going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> take like all day just to sort out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean if you can make you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's probably what an hour to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> disassemble then you've got to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> around with the calling the people yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taking it down figuring out when you've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got to do all that stuff like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> probably what three hours of work yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could probably make more than the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> money it would cost to do that yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's like definitely i would rather </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because i also don't it's sometimes not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even the money it's like i don't want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> deal with this stress like this is a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stressful thing that i don't like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> dealing with yeah and so i will pay a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> premium to not have to do that not only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that but like i have to deal with it in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this weather yeah as well it's like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that disassembling that dining table in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this heat was hell i like fixing my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> electronics and like opening them up and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing that stuff because i enjoy that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but i don't enjoy disassembling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> furniture and desks i don't think anyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> does yeah i like assembling furniture i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> don't like disassembling things some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> people are like like so good with that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff and they they enjoy it they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like disassembly furniture is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most depressing thing in the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because like at least if you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> assembling furniture you have something </SPEAKER_00>
