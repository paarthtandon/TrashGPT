<SPEAKER_04> (Connor clapping) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Congratulations, you've made it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Congratulations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've made it to the
"Trash Taste" episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Congratulations.
- Congratulations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt making bird noises) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Welcome to this
episode of "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hope you guys are doing
well and enjoy yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Have a nice seat, get comfortable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Get a little popcorn or
something, I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause we're gonna the movies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're gonna the movies? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> What are we seeing, dad? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What is this, POV? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> You're on a date with Connor. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm like, "Yeah, get
yourself comfortable." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're gonna the movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - On a date with the boys right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know what else to say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> all right, all right?
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You got me, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How you guys doing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's good, it's November, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where the fuck has this year gone? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God, dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I can say this, because this is... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> We don't have the buffer anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So whatever we talk about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, we're filming this on Tuesday, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's gonna go out Saturday, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> which is, I think the first
time in "Trash Taste" history. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Little over, when the
"Trash Taste" episodes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a meta reference. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it's a shame, there's no, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> hot topics to talk about. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't think there is any, recently. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I watched the "Dune"
movie, is that a hot topic? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, not really. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, people are talking about it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I saw it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How was that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I genuinely don't understand, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like normally, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> online, okay?
- [Connor] Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - People love to be critics
about movies, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You go onto Rotten
Tomatoes, you go onto IMDB, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> all sorts of self-acclaimed
critics, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you know, most of the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm okay with opposite opinions, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause, you know, I always wanna know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like what the opposite opinion is, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, okay, if I
really enjoyed something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right?
- Where you going with this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - Then I wanna see, like, how bad it is? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> Like if I really hate
something, I wanna know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> you know, why people
might've enjoyed it, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm usually open to it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think this might be
the first time in my life </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> where I don't understand
the opposite opinion. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because I saw so many people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on like Twitter and like Rotten Tomatoes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like, rating "Dune" is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, it was shit, it
was a disappointment." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Did you watch the
same movie that I watched?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it was genuinely the
first time where I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "I actually don't
understand your criticisms." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, is that weird?
- Why are you brain-dead? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Were you asleep during the movie? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So what about it is so good then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean 'cause I'm gonna watch it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, yeah, same here.
- But I've been watching, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> like, every other movie,
except that movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - So like, for one,
it's like one of the... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm like a massive fan of the books. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, I haven't read the books. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, but that's all right.
- Can I still enjoy it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, absolutely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I went with a couple of my friends, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of them has read the books, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the other two hadn't
read the books, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it was good to find out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you needed to be a
fan of the books or not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Luckily everyone enjoyed it.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I think it's because the
movie did a really good job </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like picking and choosing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, the right information </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to leave in the movie.
- [Connor] Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Because there's a lot of
information from the books, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that they didn't include in the movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Naturally... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, that's just
how book adaptations are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, "Dune" is like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially "Dune" is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> so fucking extensive
when it comes to its law. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, literally the first
book, at the back of the book, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> there's a literal glossary of terms </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> that you need to understand,
- Wow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - To read the book.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like, that's how it...
- So it's just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> its own terms that it's made up of. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Its own terms that it's made of. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like Frank Herbert, who's
the creator, was like so light. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> He was so fivehead, with this shit, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because like, you also have to understand </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this was written in, like 1965. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> Like, it's a 50-year-old sci-fi book. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's that old? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] It's really old.
- Wow. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've heard it's like visually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and the sound is amazing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, Dude, like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This might be a hot take, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> but I think it is one of Hans
Zimmer's best soundtracks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is some fine works, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause he's had some amazing soundtracks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like, I thought--
- The boom guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> The boom...
- The boom guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every Hans Zimmer one has the boom, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> or something like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love Hans Zimmer...
- I could be wrong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I love Hans Zimmer, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like "Lion King" soundtrack, epic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Inception"...
- He did "Lion King" ? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- He did "Lion King?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, he did "Lion King"! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You didn't know he did the "Lion King?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, Hans Zimmer did
the "Lion King" soundtrack. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Thought it was Elton John. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I am joking.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - He solo carried. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, he did the "Lion King" soundtrack. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - No fucking way.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you serious?
- Yup. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - He actually...
- To be... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> To be fair...
- You could fact-check, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but I'm pretty sure...
- To be fair, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with "Lion King," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't remember the soundtrack </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as in like the background track. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember Elton John.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Just goin ham. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - He did go ham on that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - To be fair.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah, but he did, you
know, he did "Lion King," </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> he did "Inception", he obviously... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> Basically, every Christopher
Nolan movie, he did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I thought he peeked at
like, interstellar, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, that's like the one
soundtrack, everyone says, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like, "yeah fucking
amazing movie soundtrack." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - So what would you give
the movie out of 10? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I dare ask for your score. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This archaic system,
- Out of 10? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of judging movies.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'd give it like a strong nine. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, wow.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, I'm just gonna watch it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I was gonna watch it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because the biggest criticism I've heard, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you can even call
it a criticism, really, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> is that, so much of it depends on... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Number 2, right?
- Dune, part 2, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yes.
- Because I've heard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it's not a full movie. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just...
- It covers the first half </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> of the first book.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - And it's a two and a half hour movie. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, when they release "Dune 2", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they probably will do the whole, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can watch the first
movie before the second one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you know,
- Like a bundle package. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like they did with the "Avengers". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you can watch "Infinity
War" before "End Game". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What I've heard about part 1 of "Dune" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> is that it's not like say, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Avengers Infinity War" or like "Lord... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not trying to
build a whole world... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, where you don't get,
like, a natural story arc, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just, you get half a story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I've heard its abrupt, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it does kind of just end... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can see where that
would piss people off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, and I think as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the other big thing is that, I feel, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of the criticisms I saw is that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I think, they kind of almost, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> gave it a little bit of false advertising </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> with, like the trailer, because
I watched the trailer of it, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and there's like, you know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> it looks like an action Sci-fi. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But the thing is, "Dune"
is not an action sci-fi, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's a political sci-fi. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's one of the
things where it's tough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that you can't market politics. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Which is like, which is why... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is like, why...
- Your fans are crying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am sure you can market...
- Where is my politics? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, you can market politics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but in a movie, it's
kind of hard to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "And then he signed the
paper, making the agreement." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, that's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of mecha anime, in a nutshell, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> people were just like, oh,
giant robots go pew, pew, pew. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then it was like, "Wait a minute, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm really invested in these colonies </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the politics of these colonies." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - "What is all this government bullshit?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, its like "Game of Thrones," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't tell someone "Game of Thrones" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like a political thriller
of backstabbing and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, it's got dragons and zombies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- Exactly and then... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because I watched the trailer </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> and literally the entire trailer is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like 80% of it is a lot
of like, fighting scenes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But what's funny is that, like, all of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, all the fighting
scenes in the trailer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> are all the fighting scenes in the movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] All right, okay.
- And, so, I-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not gonna watch the
trailer now, it's just spoilers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, no, so I can see why, like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I think people might've been, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe like, misinformed about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if they never, like read
the books or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Maybe, I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Since living in Japan,
I've been doing this thing, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where I just don't look at
reviews, before and after. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Full stop. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I just do not look at reviews anymore. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> I just look at the
movie, I watch a trailer, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm like, "It looks okay."
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Or even sometimes I don't
even watch the trailer, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I just pick one.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just go to the cinema and I watch it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've been really enjoying
movies a lot more. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think that's smart.
- I think that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the right thing to do.
- Yeah, that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the right thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's hard because
sometimes I watch a movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, "I think that was good," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but I need someone else to
also tell me it was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right, right.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because that's the days we live in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I experienced that recently with, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure, I don't think we can spoil it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but we were asked to watch
something by a company, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And it was the first time-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you have to make that so obvious? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, but it was the first time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I had watched something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I got like, given early
access to something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So even if I wanted to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there is no way I could
check, whether this... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What I was watching was good or not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I can't wait to talk about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we were gonna
be talking about that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on another episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> but it was like such a weird
experience for me, to be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Huh, I think this is good." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I am like, "My opinion,
I think is right, but..." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Doesn't it suck...
- It could be wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Doesn't it suck that,
at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it just boils down to, I
liked it, but is it only me? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think that
I've started to, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> from doing this a lot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I've just, because now I
don't treat movies as, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I wanna watch that one film that's good." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "I wanna just do
something for three hours." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That like, lets me shut off.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I'll just go to the
movies, watch anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - My problem with movies right now is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have such a short
attention span, like I-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's the one place
I can, like, shut off. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Like, 'cause I need, I
wanna shut off in the movie, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but I need to know that
it's worth my time, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> That's like, it's like
taking a leap of faith. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And the thing is, if you
take that leap of faith </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the movie ends up being good, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then you enjoy it way, way more. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> But I just have like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't have the attention span </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to sit through enough shitty
movies, that I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Okay, I'm just not in the mood for this." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm not sure what's
changed, I know why I'm like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because, I'll tell you
what I've been doing actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to offset this, which, I know
you think I'm a psychopath, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is whenever I get recommended
random clips on YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for a movie I haven't watched, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I see that clip, and sometimes
it's like a banger clip, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like, "All right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this movie is worth watching." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna watch the entire movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you have to basically watch like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a portion of the movie before you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm ready to watch the whole thing." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - There needs to be something
to sell me on this movie. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It doesn't even need to be
like a high scoring movie </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or something that people
like, everyone recommends, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> there just needs to be
something about this movie </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> that I'm just like, "Okay."
- A hook. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is there no part of you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that just wants to turn up to a movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and know nothing about it
and just watch something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I think that's the issue of
watching things for a job. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Where, I watch enough things
for a job, blind, anyway, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that, where in my free
time, in my downtime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I want to know that this
shit is worth my time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I get that, I get that.
- Because if it's not, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> then it's just another job. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I understand that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's weird because even
if the movie isn't as good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> as I would like it to be, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I still get the same level of enjoyment </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> from just being in the environment, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> getting to experience watching something. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> Even if it's shit, I'm like, you know... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think you just like
the cinema experience. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I really do, and also
I just like having, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes it's nice... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's nice watching something,
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's bad, so I can have
a frame of reference. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Joey] Right.
- It could be like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] This is... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - If everything I watch is good, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I have no idea what's bad anymore. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And this is why, I think,
I've relied on reviews, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause I only ever watched
the things that were good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah.
- And I feel like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the more I've just been watching stuff </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and making my own opinions, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the more I'm kind of enjoying the process </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of then just being like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, what do I think about that movie?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not not looking at anything else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's weird, I don't know,
'cause I definitely did feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> that I was so spoiled watching everything </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that was quote unquote good, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that it was getting to the point
where I'm like, "All right, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I say, this must be, I don't know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this must be a weird take." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, "What is good anymore? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean,
- I get that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I watch enough shit things for my job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Connor] Right, you're used to... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - For me, like, there's nothing
that grinds my gears more </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> when I watch something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and I feel like it was
just a waste of time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like something that's not entirely good, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but not even that bad, it was just... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, the mediocre ones are the worst. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The mediocre ones, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> "I could've done so many
things with that time." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is why you would
never go out of your way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to watch a five or a
six out of ten, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But if you turn up at a
cinema, you don't know what it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you watch a five or six out of ten, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like, "No, okay." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I'm not the kind of person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> who just walks up to a cinema and goes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm just gonna watch something." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> If I'm at a cinema, I'm
there for a specific movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Wow, I'm the opposite of that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - For me to go to a cinema, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I am committed to whatever I'm watching. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Movie theater, for you Americans? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know, fuck it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because like, to me, yeah, I get it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because if you're in the movie
theater, like, you're just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> you're committed to be there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I've only ever walked
out of one movie in my life. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> And that was...
- Which was it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Live action "Ghost in the Shell". </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, yeah, that's right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that was just
because I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched about 40
minutes and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is neither good, nor bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> This is a waste of my fucking time." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I like, I went
there by myself as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I'm like, "No commitments,
I am just going to walkout." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm trying to think what movies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched "The Last Duel" recently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you guys have heard of that movie? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nah.
- What the fuck is that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, so exactly, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So all--
- Is that a recent movie? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, all I knew about this movie, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> is that it starred Adam
Driver and Matt Damon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's all I knew about this movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I knew that it was kind of based in like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> the 13 hundreds or something.
- [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - So it turns out the
plot is about something </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where there was a famous rape case </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in the 1300s in France, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and it was kind of like
unheard of that there would be, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know, a court trial
around something like this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it ended up in a duel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the whole movie of this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like telling the
perspective of each person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> involved in the rape. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey And Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's like the woman's perspective, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the guy during the rape and
then the husband of the woman. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Right, right.
- That he rapes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's obviously like the 1300s, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so the rules are all like
totally fucked and obscene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- You know, and it was... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was good, but it was
also like really weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause we're supposed
to be like 1300s, France </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and just Matt Damon was there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like an American </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and then--
- Not even like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is this a new movie?
- Yeah, but, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and then like Ben Affleck was there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Were they doing like a
French accent or anything? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, just American,
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's just kind of like...
- Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was the first time in my life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I'd ever genuinely felt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a movie was bogged down,
by having actors I knew. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, I was like, this
is just like, I just, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't need to see Matt Damon. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because you can't un-see Matt Damon. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because, I'm watching
this movie and I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there could have been
so many better people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who could've done this role.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also, you know, if it was in French, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't have cared. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Obviously, it wouldn't have got the budget </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and obviously, you know,
that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- But like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it felt weird, 'cause then
there was like, American </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and then super British dudes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then some dudes with French accents. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was like this whole
weird thing where I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, I think the movie was good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but also there was just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the casting felt really weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't really know what to think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I did go online and
it was like 8.5 or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like,
- [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "okay." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, "I guess that makes sense." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do your opinions get skewed
when you see online reviews </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and like, when you have
your initial opinion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you see the reviews </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you...
- Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Do you think your like
opinion gets skewed, a bit? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Um, sometimes.
- Sometimes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'd love to tell you I'm immune, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> to my opinion being...
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone out there watching, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is just like, "Other people's
opinion do not affect me." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have my opinion and that's
that and I'm just like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think, for most things,
it doesn't affect me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but then there are times again </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where, like similar to your
situation, where it's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> "I'm not sure if I enjoyed it or not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I need like a second opinion about it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I need someone to tell me.
- Yeah (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I need like a second opinion.
- "Bro, bro, back me up, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> this was a good film, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> This was a good film." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, and the film
is very uncomfortable, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know, it's kind
of hard to watch at times, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then I'm also like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I guess that's the point
though, that's the idea." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> This is not supposed to be fun to watch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then I'm gonna the movies
to pay for watch something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so, I was in this weird
spot where I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This could be a four or an eight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I don't know which one it is." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I like public consensus.
- So it's one of those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of movies,
- One of those movies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I left it thinking like,
"Okay, I think it was an eight, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> but I just wish the casting was better." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I didn't read anyone else's reviews. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I just saw the score.
- [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I don't know, maybe people
disagree with me on that, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but I was like, yeah, I
was just like, whatever. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then on the opposite end
of the spectrum, I was like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna watch James Bond.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like, I know everything about this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I've read all of Daniel
Craig's weird ass interviews. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Have you seen that man's interviews? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck is that man on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Its so funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you seen some of
the shit this man's saying? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so funny.
(Joey and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Daniel Craig articles that
were better than the movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Reading these articles, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I got like 10 times more
enjoyment, reading these articles. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Did you read the article
where he was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> "I kiss everyone on set." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you read this article?
- [Both] No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need to read. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This article-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Give your homies a little smoochie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nah, da da, da da da, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it wasn't just, it wasn't,
"Give your homies a smooch." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like, oh my God, all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Say, I am Bond, James Bond, agh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Daniel Craig and Remi Malek's claim </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the pair kissed on James Bond shoot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> "I'm a very friendly guy," in quotes. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Like, who said this, Rami Malek? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Daniel Craig.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Malek said Craig grabbed
him and picked him up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after he shared a good idea for the movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so weird.
- Like, you genius. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so bizarre. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "He grabbed me, picked
me up in the moment." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "He grabbed me, picked me up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I can't tell who
initiated the next moment, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> whether it was him or I, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but a kiss transpired between
the two of us," he said. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, what kind of kiss? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - He said, "I'm gonna say Daniel Craig," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I need to know how much.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How intense was the...
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was there tongue? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was it like a full Frenchie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> or like a little peck on the cheek? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it like Sonic and Mario
making up, kind of deal? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Or were they like, rip the clothes off? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm gonna say that
Daniel Craig initiated it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was very taken aback." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> He added that the kiss was very welcome </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that, at the time, he asked Craig, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "So does this make me a Bond girl?"" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then, this is a
quote from Daniel Craig. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I kissed him, all right,
I kiss lots of people," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Craig said.
(Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "It's like, I'm a very friendly guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I wouldn't rank anybody." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "That would be a terrible thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to do."
- Ranking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - To rank the best kissers, I would, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I would just, how many
people could I offend? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Terrible, thousands of people." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's going on on
the set of James Bond? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - He's just go around
to every actor and like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> "Have I kissed you yet? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Not sure" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Going around like just Frenching people. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's not the audition process. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, "You're suitable for the role. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Now, okay, okay, get Daniel Craig in." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This article is insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Listen, this story's had
legs about kissing Rami. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've just been trying to get it more legs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if it's on social media. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't got social media, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I said, I used to kiss
Rami at the end of every scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is like, it's just
like not a big deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God almighty, just spreading the love." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Malek,
(Connor laughing hysterically) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Malik, quipped, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "I would just rush through scenes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just to get to the moment
that you would get kissed." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> What's going, what's-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Wait, so, is like Rami Malek into it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's loving it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And the whole set is loving it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sounds like a fucking
love story going on here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - The director is like,
definitely, pushing through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one take wondering--
- It was just kinda like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why don't you just like, just fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just such a bizarre read. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "What is going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why are they sharing this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It sounds like an onion article. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I watched James Bond,
Daniel was nothing like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I watched James Bond and
I was just imagining him </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> at the end of every scene. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I just imagined him just running off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and going and making out with Malek. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love it, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "This is the best article
I've ever read in my life." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was laughing my ass off.
- [Joey] So funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like there's countless articles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> from Daniel Craig before
this movie came out, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are just like, insane.
- Just losing his mind. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just saying the random-est shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He just brought up the one time, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he was like, he only goes to gay bars </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's more friendly or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, what is--
- He's not gay though, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, he's like, I
feel more safe there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other people won't try
and start fights with me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "What are you doing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why you are getting in
fights, in every bar?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, he is James Bond.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know, but he's like 50, man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is he's just like method acting? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know, man, I was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> "You're going to gay bars,
you're kissing Malek" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like Craig, man, come on, let us, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come on, just, what's going on buddy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you want me to say it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, it's cool, it's cool, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's 2021 bro, like, it's fine, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's gonna be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> my favorite Daniel Craig
clip though, you guys know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Weekend, yeah.
- Ladies and gentlemen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, and there's--
- The Weekend. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's another article </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where he didn't know about the meme, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they introduced the meme to him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- And he's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "That's great, that's amazing." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, Daniel Craig articles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> are better than the fucking movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The articles are 10 out of 10, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the movie was a five out of 10. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- That's kinda how I see... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, did you watch the movie?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The time to kill, was it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The new one?
- To die. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Time to Die." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Time to die.
- It was all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- It's fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, I dunno. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - You should do a movie
Snapchat, or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm not even really like
a fan of the Daniel Craig, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> James Bond movies, like any of them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Casino Royale" is good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think that "Casino Royale"-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Skyfall was okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think, he more like,
peaked at "Casino Royale" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and then-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a shame that it
was like his first movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- After that he just-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, that's when they like
really re-imagined James Bond. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> never really had like a
massive fan of James Bond, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but obviously, I just feel like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just not as massive
a franchise as it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when, you know, we were growing up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when our, like our parents' age. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- And I think like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> especially you'd said about
like the Matt Damon movie, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which I somehow haven't heard of, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like back in the day if Matt
Damon and who else was in it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Adam Driver and Ben Affleck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, it was a good movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean, these
are like A-list actors, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I remember back in the
day, if they were in a movie, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you'd fucking hear about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> But nowadays, I feel like movies... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's weird 'cause movies aren't sold </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on their actors anymore, I feel like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well no, there's this amazing
interview at Comicon with, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I forgot what the name of the guy is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> guy plays, the guy with
Iron Man, he's like, friend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - John Favreau? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - John Cheadle?
- Not John Cheadle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, another (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Wait, now, wait, what,
who, wait, it wasn't him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Who does? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's a superhero. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Anthony Mackie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Anthony Mackie.
- Oh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Man Off Camera] That's falcon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's Falcon.
- Falcon, that's who he was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's not Iron Man's best friend, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that's Captain America's best friend. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Come on there partner, get it together. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - The widest picture.
- Wide Anthony Mackie. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually, there's a,
so what's the quote? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So he did this formal
interview at Comic-Con, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it came on my recommended at one point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was him just basically
explaining how like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, like Stallone, Schwarzenegger, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> don't sell movies anymore. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's the superheroes that sell movies. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, nobody cares, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, they do care about
the actor who plays it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's not the actor who brings in the, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe Robert Downey Jr.
- [Garnt] It needs to be like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It needs to be like the right actor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause back in the day you
could just hire an actor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> for a role.
- Just like, what was that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> What was that dreadful
movie that Robert Downey Jr. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did with like, it was like
Dr. Dolittle, but like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah.
- And like it bombed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I remember
- It was right after Endgame. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - His first like, big movie, apparently </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> was this awful "Dr.
Dolittle" kind of version, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> and he was trying to do like
a Welsh accent or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Man Off Camera] It
was a Dolittle movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Was it a re-imagining of "Dr. Dolittle"? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Man Off Camera] It was a remake. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I think it was a
remake of "Dr.Dolittle". </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like these movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that don't need remake, "Dr. Dolittle". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause the thing is,
yeah, Robert Downey Jr. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was massive as Iron Man,
but at the same time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think, Robert Downey Jr. was
just acting Robert Downey Jr. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Man Off Camera] He was
great in Sherlock Holmes, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just saying.
- Yeah, Sherlock Holmes... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, but that's because
he was (indistinct) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> just playing a British version of himself. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, like it's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like the movie
culture I feel has changed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and people care more
about concepts nowadays. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause like, even with
something like "Dune", </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a massive like,
new movie franchise. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't actually know
any of the actors in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Even though I know there are
some famous actors in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - There's some famous actors,
- Is Zendaya in it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Man Off Camera] Timothee Chalamet. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is Zendaya in it?
- [Man Off Camera] Zendaya. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, Zendaya's in it.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - But like I, yeah... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's not the reason
you're watching "Dune". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, Jason Momoa's probably
the biggest one that's-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah, Jason Momoa's in it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But that's like, not the
reason you're watching-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] No.
- You know, so, in some ways, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm kind of glad that it's straight away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from the actors sell
movies, not the movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it kind of is, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it means that we hopefully
get different actors for what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we still don't really but, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's more chance that
you'll go to watch a movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> because people say--
- Because of the concept. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Not because Stallone's in it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- Like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, I was never really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if this is 'cause of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> different generation thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I never really cared
about the actor in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I didn't either,
I mean, it sold movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I am for the character.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, the performance is good, great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> That's good for them, but...
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's a bonus if it's
like an actor that you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or an actor that you know is
like perfect for the role, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's like, I'm not gonna go watch... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The only one I can think of
is like a Nicholas Cage movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'll watch him because
Nic Cage is in it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - But that's like a meme. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That's just like watching
an Adam Sandler movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Now, Adam Sandler's
like the only guy now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> who can like sell movies by just, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> being--
- Being Adam Sandler. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Literally just being him. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> He's literally like the
only guy who could like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> make a career of just,
fuck, like being like lazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Just like doing anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] That's true.
- You know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> even then he fucking
killed it in "Uncut Gems." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll say this for like
the 10 millionth time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Watch that goddamn movie, it's amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do yourself a favor, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and you need to do yourself
a favor, watch that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like, I had this
thought the other day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was like, on the
topic of celebrity culture, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> do you think there's gonna be someone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who is going to be as
famous as Michael Jackson is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in our lifetime, again? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause I feel like--
- Probably. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hmm.
- You think so? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Probably. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know, I don't
think there will... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who do you think is the
most famous person right now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Kim Kardashian, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, I actually googled this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after I had this thought. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you know who is
ranked as the number one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> most famous celebrity? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Lets think again.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Isn't it like fucking, it's
a footballer probably, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel
Messi were in the top 10 though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - What's the occupation?
- Actor. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> An actor?
- Yeah, I was surprised. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wish it's Adam Sandler. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Number two was Donald Trump, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> which was not surprising.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Now that I think about it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but number one really surprised me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Male, female? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Male.
- Male, male actor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hold on, I can think.
- Yeah, I can think, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't intend this
to turn this into a quiz. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Brad Pitt?
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It is Dwayne The Rock Johnson.
(Man off camera laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, yeah. Okay, yeah.
- No way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm just like, is he that famous? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, he is, he is.
- Is he? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah he is.
- Like, internationally? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Isn't he's like one of the
most like highest paid actors? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, he is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - 'Cause like, "Fast and Furious" movies </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are like everywhere. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Everywhere. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - He's also one of those actors
that looks and feels natural </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> in like an adult film,
like "Fast and Furious", </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> but also in like a Disney film. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah.
- You know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is "Fast and Furious" an adult film? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, I mean, compared to like "Moana". </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not a kids movie.
- It's not a kids movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's true.
- He's also, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, I mean, so you will, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but like having a recognizable
face and figure, is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> definitely a part of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's true.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And just his name's The
Rock, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> People are gonna remember that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Rock. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dwayne The Rock Johnson.
(speaking in Japanese accent) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - What surprised me is
that he wasn't like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> he wasn't the first
person to come up to mind, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when I think of like a
famous person, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But he is just-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - But he's also one of those guys where, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> if you say the name, then
you're like, oh yeah, of course, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah, you know, like, "Yeah, he's famous." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's definitely easier </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you have like a
name that's super easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Dwayne The Rock Johnson. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - That is also a cool name, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's cool.
- The pain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's more like catchy
than just Dwayne Johnson. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially like, traveling
around the world now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you realize that people are just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like there's different levels of famous, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> depending on where you are on the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cristiano Ronaldo is
like, known everywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Football's massive except for
probably like the US, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's probably like
the biggest place that-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - But they all probably
know Ronaldo still, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe.
- Do they? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno, Americans, do you
know who Cristiano Ronaldo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Lionel Messi is? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know at one point,
David Beckham was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the most famous person on Earth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't think he is now
'cause he hasn't really-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- But I swear like 10, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> 20 years ago, he was
the most famous person. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, because--
- Bend it like Beckham phase. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Oh, my God.
- Well, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's weird to see how celebrity
culture has evolved, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Because I'm like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how I got onto this thought was I remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I got recommended a clip of
a Michael Jackson concert, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was just literally like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Michael Jackson standing up on the stage, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> standing still.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then people are just like
passing out in the crowd. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's fucking insane.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So there's this concert,
there's a really famous concert, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it's on YouTube, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The opening, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - The lights come on,
and then from the stage, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's like a trap door that opens </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and Michael Jackson literally shoots out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, emerges out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - With some sunglasses
and he's standing there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And I swear for 10 minutes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this crowd is losing their fucking mind. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - There are people like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - He literally just stands there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The literal clip on YouTube is called </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Michael Jackson Stands
Still and People Pass Out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> He's not even moving.
- It's fucking insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's just like insane to think that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like he was, back in the day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he was put up to like
almost godlike status. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, I can't imagine someone today </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> having that kind of reaction </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or anyone today having that kind of a... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, I feel that way as well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> whenever I look at, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like Beatlemania clips from like the 70s. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, exactly, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - People losing their mind
to The Beatles, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's BTS now, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh.
- You think so? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> You think so? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think it's to the
same level as the Beatles high. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the thing is, I
dunno, I think BTS is in line. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The BTS fans are like,
oh, challenging accepted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's the closest thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've had to that level of like intensity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] True.
- But I don't think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> we've had any-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think though the thing
is it doesn't look as intense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because a lot of that is all online now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] That's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whereas back in the, during Beatlemania, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, if you wanted to go see The Beatles, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> you had to go, physically to go see them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] That's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think another thing is
that you just know way more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about the celebrity, nowadays,
because of social media, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like, it kind of
like humanizes them more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> than before, when your
only exposure to them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was through like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> news media and TV and like--
- Like interviews </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and stuff like that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And that was the only slice
you got, behind what was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> what their lives were. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And now, you know about everything, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like, you know, the good and the bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I remember, it's so weird seeing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like, for example, Chris Pratt, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember when everyone
fucking loved Chris Pratt, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he was like,
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he was like the golden child.
- Yeah, he was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Of the internet.
- Do you mean now? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, he's not.
- No, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then suddenly people
just started hating him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't remember what set it off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't even know why...
- Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It might've been the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember he did like a
lot of Christian remarks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of people like, were
not like, happy about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, oh, okay.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I guess I missed that arc of Chris Pratt. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I missed that arc, I just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one day I woke up and it was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was cool to like Chris Pratt, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then I woke up on another year </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and everyone was suddenly hating him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And now it's cool to
like Chris Pratt again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause he's getting everyone-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I could be mistaken on this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I know that a lot of
people got annoyed at him </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> around the time of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think when James Gunn got fired? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yes, yes, yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And everyone from "Guardians
of the Galaxy" like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> tried to like, openly like
supporting, you know, James Gunn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think Chris Pratt didn't
really do anything in that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like, kind of rubbed people the wrong way, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> or he gave some vague
Christian-esque statement </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that people didn't really like. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know that was around the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I first started seeing stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people like, didn't like Chris Pratt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- You know, I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's all, you know, the
internet is like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Now you can't stop
hearing about Chris Pratt, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause not only now he's he Mario, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but he's also Garfield, as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't believe...
- Is he Garfield? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - He's voicing Garfield. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When did this get announced? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Today.
- This morning. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - So like, the real MVP
here, Chris' agent is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> fucking...
- [Joey] Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Who the fuck is that agent?
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This man is insane.
- In his ways. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bro, this agent, man, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> he better keep him on lock, man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This agent is... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Could you imagine if, just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> your agent just walked in and
was like, "Oh, by the way, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're gonna be voicing
Mario and Garfield." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Next up, next up,
you'll see it, tomorrow, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's voicing Gru from "Despicable Me". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's taking over Steve Carell, move aside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He's not as marketable anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> My God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like this morning,
especially on Twitter, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like--
- Why's he Garfield? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And also did you hear as
well that they're making-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So you know how Seth Rogan
is playing as Donkey Kong? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Donkey Kong is getting
his own movie, as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's been confirmed.
- As Seth Rogan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As Seth Rogan.
- Fuck off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that was confirmed as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck off, you're lying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unfortunately.
(Joey sighing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was the weird timeline
I woke up to this morning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like Seth Rogan, Donkey
Kong is getting his own movie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and Chris Pratt is Garfield. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's going on with these movies? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is like the proof </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we live in a parallel universe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing ) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, we've like, somehow,
like we've jumped timelines </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and we've not realized that
we've jumped timelines. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you want the Mario movie to be good? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
(Joey sighing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
- Why no? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I see--
- Define good, define good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You want it to like legitimately be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a critically successful-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you think the "Sonic" movie was good? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually liked the-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I like the "Sonic" movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like you should go
into like that kind of realm. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, where it's like critically, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> nothing to really get,
- Yeah, it's just fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - But it was good fun. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Conceptually, it was fun, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, I, yeah, yeah.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah, what do I want it to be? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - I just don't know what
to think about it, I guess. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just can't put my, you know how, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you hear the "Sonic"
movie and it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you can kind of figure out, "All right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can kind of understand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they would go with this
cast and these characters." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That makes sense
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> With the Mario thing that
they've announced so far, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think, the reason why
everyone's freaking out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause everyone's like, "What
the fuck is this movie?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, "What are they doing?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Actually, it goes... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What actually is this movie gonna-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It goes against what we
just said, where we said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> celebrities can't sell a movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They fucking sold me on this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> they sold me on the "Mario" movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They sold me, but like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, there's no
way this can be a movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Like an actual thing.
- [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's so surreal
about the "Mario" movie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is that it's a fucking meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It is a shit-post that got
made into reality, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - How is Donkey Kong as Seth Rogan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna contribute to this plot? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't understand, because
Donkey Kong rarely contributes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> to any-fucking-thing in "Mario". </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He's kinda just chilling-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The one I'm personally
excited for is Keegan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> playing as Toad.
- How is... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> How is that gonna come into this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> How are they gonna
introduce Keegan, as Toad? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> How does that happen in the movie? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm thinking, I'm sitting here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I hope this ages poorly or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm so confused. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, even now, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then the real Mario voice
actor's gonna cameo, how? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> How is that gonna happen? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] That's what I am wondering. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is he just gonna say,
"It's a me, "Mario" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and Mario is like, "Fuck it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "It's a you, Mario." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is he gonna say--
- "It's not a me" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pranks gonna be like,
"No, it's a me, Mario." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And then like, they
have this weird fucking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> rush hour three-esque, stupid thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, is that what's gonna happen? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, the entire thing
could be like a new grounds, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> parody animation from like
2010 or something, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like an OneyNG. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right, except
it's the fucking reality. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then it's by Illumination, as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> which is also like "The fuck!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I don't know what's going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What have Illumination done? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Despicable Me."
- "Despicable Me." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that kind of, those kind of movies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did they make the "Emoji" movie as well? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, that was Sony.
- Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sony movies...
- Luckily, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sony movies, ah...
- Ooh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, they had like,
"Into the Spider-Verse", </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> then they were like, ton of backtrack. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's different for
different studios and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think that was a different studio </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and then "Into the
Spider-Verse" is kind of just, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> its own anomaly, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause there's no other
animated movie, I think, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that is just like "Into the
Spider-Verse", 'cause its, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- Such a unique-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Still haven't watched it, and I wanna-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You haven't watched it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - See, here's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I really, really, really wanted
to watch it in the cinema </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just didn't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and then now I really wanna
watch it, but I'm like, "Fuck, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it would just do a
disservice to watch it." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I thought-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just so, you just never
gonna watch it then? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - No.
- You never. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's probably like, it's one
of the best animated movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't give a shit about
Spider-Man, but I loved it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or maybe one day,
I'll just go to like a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll find a really rich
friend and I'll be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Can I go to your home cinema? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And can we watch "Into the Spider-Verse" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I've been like holding off on it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, could we do that?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't have any friends
with a movie theater-thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe face (indistinct).
- We'll make one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Trash Tastes Movies.
- Trash Taste Movies Theater. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, let's move the Trash Tastes studio </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to like, Arkansas or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I bet like, we could get like,
a big plot of land there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, probably. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, then we can get a theater there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Arkansas fans, what do you say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, one thing, I'm so jealous, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> whenever I see American set up
their studios of their house, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just, like, they've
got so much fucking space. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> If we paid the amount we're
paying for this studio, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in America, we'd have,
like, quadruple the space. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because, like, even in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like, living in England, as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> we don't get space in
England, as well, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like our houses compared to Americans' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are like, fucking tiny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Although they are bigger than Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, where I put Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> UK is 20% bigger and then 80% is-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What would you say, Japan or Tokyo? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because there's two different things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But even outside of, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you go to the countryside in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you'll see these, like,
giant sprawling fields. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You'll see four tiny houses,
just right next to each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They don't want any privacy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they decided, "Fuck privacy." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, "The rice
fields need more room." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Because that's what the countryside is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like 90% rice fields. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But with the amount we're
paying for this studio, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> if we were like way outside in Japan-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Oh, true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - We'd probably get, like, at
least double, triple space. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Some of those houses, they're
giving them away for free. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Some of them are, like,
a hundred bucks a month. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, like, the
housing market in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is, like, not the most
healthiest thing in the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean,
(Connor shouting) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what happens when you
have a declining population, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right?
- Yep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so people are
literally giving away houses </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> in some places? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's interesting,
'cause Japan's government </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just, like, "Yeah, it's a problem." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then it was like,
"What are you gonna do?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan's like, "Yeah, it's a problem." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's another social
issue in Japan, actually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, they say, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no, they go, "Oh, it's a problem, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what are you gonna do about it?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Like, "We'll make the
old people live longer." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're, basically.
- Up the healthcare. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Their kids will stay in
the countryside, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - People wanna stay in the countryside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Will they have a job? I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really interesting 'cause
it's one of those problems, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that, like, where its, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't have a platform to campaign on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> being like, "Yeah, I'll fix the problems </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's gonna come in 30 years." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is all politics, I guess, really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This episode is sponsored by Express VPN. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Going online without Express VPN </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like using your smart
phone without a case. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt speaking
in foreign language) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Most of the time,
you'll probably be fine, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but all it takes is one accident drop </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> onto solid concrete
(Joey gasping) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to make you wish you
had protected yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nightmare fuel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Every time you connect
to an un-encrypted network </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in cafes, hotels, airports, anywhere, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your online data is not secure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Any hacker on that same network </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can gain access
(Connor gasping) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and steal your personal data. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you serious?
- I am serious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck, and it actually doesn't take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much technical knowledge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to hack someone.
- [Joey] What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just some cheap hardware is needed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a smart 12-year old could do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And Joey, don't forget, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your data is valuable.
- [Joey] Is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Hackers can make
up to $1,000 per person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> selling personal info on the dark web. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But luckily, Express VPN </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> creates a secure encrypted
tunnel between your device </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and the internet so
that hackers can't steal </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> your sensitive data. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It would take a hacker
with a super computer </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> over a billion years to get
past Express VPN's encryption. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> All you have to do is fire up
the app and click one button </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Wonderful.
- Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But no, yeah, I saw the
"Matrix" trailer, as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And, you know, when,
- Oh, have we started? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I guess so, you brought up the "Matrix". </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, yeah.
- So Joey brought up, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> seeing the "Matrix".
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I saw the trailer for the
"Matrix Resurrection", </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think it's called.
- Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna be honest with you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've watched all the "Matrix" movies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I cannot remember what
happened in any of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Me neither. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I kind of have, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because I went on a stint
of watching "Matrix" clips, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like for some random...
- Not the movies. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not the movies, the
clips and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I think the second and
third movie were way better </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> than what I remembered, 'cause
I was watching these clips. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Really?
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was watching the clips. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> This is just how I
experience movies, nowadays. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt literally doesn't watch movies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Garnt watches one fifth of a movie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> and decides if he likes the movie or not, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and then never watches it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I can't believe we're
about to live vicariously </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> through you, watching clips. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause, like, I just watch
the best parts of the movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> The great thing about watching
the best parts of the movies </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is that you get to blank
out, all the shit-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Makes the movie look way better. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just makes the movie look way better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I remember saying in our movie episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I don't think the
"Matrix" has aged well at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> there was like so many
little things that I didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really understand when I first
watched the "Matrix" trilogy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mm-hmm.
- Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Apparently, the co-director
said that it was a metaphor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for being trans, the whole movie series. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What?
- Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, I mean the,
Wachowski brothers did-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, they are the Wachowski sisters-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, they are the sisters, so yeah...- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it was a metaphor about being trans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm trying to... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Did that pop up in any of the clips? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know, I, you know, again, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> this is just saying I read and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, I didn't know that.
- [Joey] Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, cool, I mean, I didn't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what I found was really cool,
was how the entire world, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was kind of, like, built,
like, you know, like a program. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I didn't realize at the time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I watched it as a kid, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that basically every character, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like, represented a different program </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or a different subsystem of the "Matrix". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm just like, "Oh, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there was so much thought,
that went into this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about "Matrix" law, that just
fucking flew over my head </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as a kid.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm just like, "Oh, cool, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people go bang, bang, bang, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pew, pew, pew."
- Yeah, slow-mo, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and that's all I care.
- Bang, bang, bang. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's all I cared about as a kid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I realized when I was
like watching these clips </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like watching videos
about "Matrix" law </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like how and what-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you watch a 10-hour YouTube essay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about why the "Matrix" is
good and you should care? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I watched-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That was only about four hours. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, it was two hours, actually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was only about four hours, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thank you very much.
(Connor and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I needed someone to tell me
what to think about the movie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because...
(Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's why I watch "Gigguk",
to get down with anime. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> So do you think it needs a new movie? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you want a new movie of "Matrix"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, I wasn't expecting
it, but you know what? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I am curious, if I were to be honest. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know if it makes Keanu
happy, I'm fine with it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think there is space for a new movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - The problem is, I don't
remember how the third movie ends. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - The third movie ends, spoiler alert. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - For a 20-year old movie. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, for a 20-year old movie, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with Neo and agent Smith fighting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- And you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're doing, like, the Superman shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah
- And then Agent Smith, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> like, I forgot, like, what he, like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> puts his hand into Neo </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> who becomes agent Smith and
then Neo dies, because-- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right, right, right.
- And then-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that was it.
- [Connor] Epic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then humans and
machines live in harmony </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the "Matrix" is saved,
(Joey snickering) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> and that's it, then it's remade. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I think that's the movie. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So how would you go on, from that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well--
- Good question. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I can't remember what the
trailer of the plot was. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah.
- It's just very confusing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I just think there is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because, that's what got me into it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because I saw the trailer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Now, I remember, because I was, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "How are they gonna make a fourth movie?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so that got me to look
into the original trilogy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is why I go on
uploads once a month. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like retracing my steps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to why I started watching "Matrix" clips, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was because of the fourth trailer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think there is space </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there is space
for more storytelling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with different iterations of the "Matrix". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think that was one
really interesting part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the "Matrix" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was never, been able
to, what was never explored </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> in the original, which was, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this was just one version of the "Matrix". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah,
- So there were like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there could be plenty of others </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and there could be plenty
of others in the future. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So there's so many ways you can-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - So what you're saying is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it could turn into like
a "Fate" situation. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no, no, no,
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I did not say that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I did not say that.
- Okay, that was Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - That was Joey. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You said there were multiple universes, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> multiple timelines, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and all I could think of
was, oh, it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like "Fate". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a moon,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they have a moon.
(Joey gasping) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my, okay, so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna watch the movie,
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I understand that I have to go back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and watch the other three.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think you do though.
- No, really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- Oh, really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I kind of want to, though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I feel like, I've missed
so much point of the movie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but then also re-watching
the other movies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't not pay attention. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's one of those movies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you look away, your phone for one second, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> you're like, "Rewind that
two minutes, please." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah, I do wanna watch it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, it was a different, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was a different experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going like revisiting the "Matrix". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I kind of realized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how much of an amazing
character Morpheus is, now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that makes me really sad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they didn't get Laurence Fishburne </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to come back as Morpheus--
- [Connor] Oh yeah they-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Even though they got like the main-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is there a reason why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think because they're doing
young Morpheus, in this one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So
- Ah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, it might be,
might be a plot point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - But he was in "John Wick".
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was in John wick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was he in "John Wick"?
- He's in John wick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is he in "John Wick"?
- He's in "John Wick". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah.
- Oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did like that Keanu Reeves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically just--
- Looks like "John Wick". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It was just basically "John Wick". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's given up and I love that, though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I'm gonna contradict
myself to my point earlier </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where I said that I don't watch
movies 'cause of the actors. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I will watch almost
anything with Keanu Reeves, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> just because he's such a delight to watch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Oh yeah.
- Like, he does just have... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> He always, you can tell he loves it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's also a colder
thing that in real life </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he's also really chill.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, I know it's like the thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you do on, when you're, on the internet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to just adore Keanu Reeves, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like legitimately,
like when he's on screen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I love watching him.
- [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I genuinely feel that he loves
every second of performing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's just a delight to watch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Sometimes it's just nice to see someone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who loves something that they do. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like saying, love
someone who loves their job. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, I don't know, it's
the little things in life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's just, even when he's
doing these characters, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> you can just tell, like, through it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah,
- I don't know why. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how you can
do that, but it works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know why but Keanu Reeves </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> seems like the kind of guy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> who would, like, collect
merch of the movies he's in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - He's like that kind of guy, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, "Yo, I've got this
"John Wick" action figures, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> fuck insane. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - "John Wick" is like
some of my most enjoyable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> theater experiences. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, every single time
I've gone to watch it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the movie theaters, I've
just had such a fucking delight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've only seen the first one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly.
- I've only seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the first one as well.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Please watch the other
two, they're so fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah.
- Really good movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Watch "John Wick".
- Just go watch "John Wick". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Watch "John Wick" for a day.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Do you know what realization
I had the other day, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> as you guys are talking about movies? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- So I haven't been watching </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> movies recently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've gone back to watching anime now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know, I know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> I finished my seasonal
video and I'm just, like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like continuing some of these shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out of my, own volition.
- [Connor] Pride. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What did you watch, Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> What did you watch? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I just had this
realization the other day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, I like anime.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, well, one, yeah,
I actually like anime, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> and number two, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I finished watching
some of these episodes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt sighing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't have anyone to talk to this about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, no. (Joey laughing)
- Once again in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Once again in my life.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I am sorry." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I realized that everyone
in my life around me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> doesn't watch anime anymore. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> "Am I the last motherfucker
who still watches anime?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey singing "Mad World"
by Michael Andrews) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just watch, I watch
normie mainstream anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't watch...
- If it's not on Netflix, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor doesn't touch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Listen, I'll watch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> If it's off of Netflix, I'll
just begrudgingly do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll be like, "For fuck's sake." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause it...
- Okay, go, go, go, go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was so weird, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because, like, when me and
Sidney started our relationship, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> we'd like, this side of
our relationship was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we'd watch like a new show or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. -
- Between us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like every, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every time we had some free time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and now I'm just like, "Honey,
you wanna watch an anime?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And she's like, "No!" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Show me a, put on a shitty horror movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's what I wanna watch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's put on 90 day fiance." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - "Get that Japanese shit outta here." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Eww. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I'm just like, "Okay." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I started my YouTube journey </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> having no friends around
me who watched anime. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Then I found--
- Too many. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Too many friends who watch anime, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm just like, every
time I hung out with friends, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone around me watch anime. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then, now, I moved to
Japan, started an anime podcast, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm dating a girl, who, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm going to get married to a girl </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who was a big weeb, an anime fan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and no one around me
fucking watches anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I've literally looped back
to where I started off at. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Those who don't learn from history </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> are doomed to repeat it, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - This cycle of a weeb. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is so surreal now, though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know more people who've watched anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> and who were like, heavy anime fans. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But are now just like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> now just like more integrated
into, like, the weeb culture </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> or like the wider anime culture, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without actually watching anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know that meme where it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the floor is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like the meme, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like the floor is watching anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, literally doing everything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but watching...
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been reading, like, books, recently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like...
- Wait, what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You've been reading books? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Books, with no pictures.
(Joey gasping) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I would talk about it, except
I haven't finished them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Pics or it didn't happen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm reading a few of them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What kind? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, storybooks, information books? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like, fictional,
nonfiction, autobiograpy? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, non-fiction.
- Just give us a taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Non-fiction. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll talk about when I'm,
I'm halfway through one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's really good, right now.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's about Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's really good,
I'll talk about it later. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow.
- Something good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Something's like, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's like literally,
the floor is anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> and I'm like, fucking
jumping in the air, like. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - What timeline are we in?
- I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm reading. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Connor's reading a book,
Chris Pratt is Garfield. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not watching anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like we are in
the "Matrix" right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know, all the signs you look for, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> to, like, see if the world
we're living in is fake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like there's enough
going on around me right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> but I'm just like--
- We're in the "Matrix". </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - All right, stop the simulation. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know that...
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Get me out, get me out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Connor read a book,
I'm gonna kill myself, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I'm in a simulation.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I watched, actually I
didn't tell you about this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched an anime on
the plane back to the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I watched eight
episodes and I stopped. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I was very angry.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I watched, was it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 81, 87, was it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 86.
- 86. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, It was shit.
- Was it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was bad.
- You didn't like it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I thought it was bad. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've heard really good things about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Bro, it was--
- Like, literally everyone, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I know says its amazing.
- What was bad about it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I like it.
- What'd you like about it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I just liked the concept, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's been so long since we've seen, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like it's the
closest we've had, to, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one of these mega shows
that I watched growing up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at least, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it was like two nations
going against each other, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then there was some mystery going on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you didn't know-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you like the mystery? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was so bored by the mystery. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, "Okay, whatever." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then the whole time--
- Don't look at me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I haven't seen it.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The whole time, they were
doing the whole thing of like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> you know, obviously, racism is bad, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I get it.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - But when they like
spoonfeed it to you, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Racism-bad, huh?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It comes here and it's like,
- "Agh, racism!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And its like, all right, I get it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, such an unnuanced take about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that I was like, "Okay,
all right, we get it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I get that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, I was just so, like,
I was so bored by it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "I get it," right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't need you to tell
me that this is, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the story, like, this is... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I should feel sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - So they were like, over-explaining it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] To me it felt,
- I mean, it was very, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was very much put in your face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, the entire thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> was basically based around World War II. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it was kinda like, nudging, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "Huh, is it bad? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Huh?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was the whole time watching it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just so bored. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, and the
whole mystery aspect to it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I was not enjoying it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I, "Should we roughly explain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the plot of the show is first?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What do you remember?
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm very curious.
- This has been a month. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's been two months,
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> since I watched this
and it was on a plane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love it when Connor
tries to describe an anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There is a main MC who is a... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone in this world, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is in this beautiful homogenous society. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone is the same,
has the same hair color, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and same, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone looks exactly...
- Everyone's white. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's Aryan bro, they're all Aryan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's literally what
they're trying to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just say that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, then, they literally were like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - They are all white, just say that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's anime Aryans, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so they have green hair
instead of, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey mocking sarcastically) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so they're in this world
and everything's perfect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they keep doing this
fucking stupid thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they're like, and it was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was so obvious what they were tryna do, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it was just, not happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like, "Okay, we get it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like, every
single day, they'd be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "We have zero casualties in
this war, isn't that amazing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Zero casualties, zero casualties." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the whole point of it is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they have these mechs that are fighting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're piloted by the other people, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who are not the perfect race.
- [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they make them fight in the mechs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Peasants. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they have, oh yeah, peasants. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Peasants, guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they have these mech, like, captains, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these are the captains
that talk to the peasants, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God forbid they have
to talk to them, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Somebody has to talk to them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in this world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And our main protagonist, guess what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She's sympathetic to the
peasants, as they say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm calling them peasants, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why, I've caught the cold. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Garnt said peasants,
(Garnt laughing hysterically) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I'm running with it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - They're called the peasants now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - So obviously she's sympathetic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and she starts to become
friends with them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right.
- Oh, turns out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> these other race of people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just normal human
beings, who would've thought? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, it's just like,
"All right, come on, man." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Like, come on! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It does sound pretty dumbed down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So like, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, like a Disney
movie take on it, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It was just so, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like Dr. Seuss. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like "Cat in the Hat"
level of talking about-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right.
- I was just like, so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I already get it, come on,
we're in 21st century now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> we can do more nuanced takes about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll tell you like a perfect analogy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which will, I think
you'll understand, Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It feels like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a Gen Urobuchi show, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> without being written by Gen Urobuchi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So
- Yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Explain that to me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I get what, exactly
what you mean by that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, you get it now?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You get it?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, now explain that to me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so Gen Urobuchi is the
guy who wrote "Psycho-Pass", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> who wrote "Madoka Magica" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and "Saya no Uta".
- "Saya no Uta". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, "Psycho-Pass",
I thought was amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like a really good take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the whole societal aspect of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, this just felt like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, but that's what he means. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like a show that's
written by Gen Urobuchi, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but not...
- But worse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- But like, not as nuanced. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Am I? Do you think it's bad? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you think my opinions on this-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I think, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think you actually
have the correct opinion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's like very spoonfed into you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, racism is bad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's never why I kind of liked it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I kind of liked more, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I kind of more gravitated
towards like, the mystery aspects </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of just like, 'cause one thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one big thing you missed
is they're at war, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so this nation is at war
with another nation, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I could figure out,
roughly what was going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the other nation has robots </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are completely autonomous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, they have technical, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they have a technology
that is way more advanced </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they have AI robots that
they're fighting against, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> except, the nation that we're following </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has human robots, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So apparently, the nation is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't remember the exact details </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I'm not up to date, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but apparently, the nation
has a time limit, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And after this time limit is over, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then the robots are going to shut down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause there's no one
actually telling these robots </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to fight.
- And then if they like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> year about Y2K, probably won't happen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, but, like, I was more, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what drew me in with this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was more the mystery aspects </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and more like the character dynamics </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> between the main girl and
the and the group itself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I agree, but at times,
the character dynamics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> did feel real predictable
and stale, for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was just kind of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanted to know more about the enemy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I wanted to learn
more about the mystery, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but everything else was
such a slog to sit through. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- That I was just like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is it maybe because it's a concept </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> that you've already seen in anime before? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It couldn't be that, it
could also just be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I just didn't feel like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> although the mystery
aspect was quite good, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all the other aspects didn't
really entice me, personally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> And also I was on a plane,
so it was the choice of like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I can try and get some sleep here </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or I can continue watching the show. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was really struggling, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> every episode I kept going on, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I kept thinking it's really going-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - You know, it's not a good sign, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when you have to choose between </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> watching the next episode and sleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - I really wanted it to pick up the pace. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, it was really like
taking it's fucking time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they really-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's something I agree on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They really, like, wanted to show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that the main character
was sympathetic, but like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was obvious, she was sympathetic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they just kept doing things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> to show that she was
sympathetic, over and over again. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was just like, "I get it." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah,
- We get it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We all know, we get it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - There's lots of
sympathetic MCs out there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was just so frustrating
watching the show </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where they just had the same
copy and paste, like, action, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where she would talk to
someone, they'd be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Oh, don't talk to the peasants." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And then she'd be like, "But I like them." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then she would literally
have this conversation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> with everyone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And yeah, okay, maybe that
would happen in real life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> if the situation was real,
but it was just so boring, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they had to show it every goddamn time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> We get it, it's not normal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I also think it was bad
timing that this came off, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> came out after "Attack
on Titan", which is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think a way better,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Way to show some of the
themes that "86" was showing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think "Attack on Titan"
was kind of like a masterclass </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in that sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, it took
aspects of "Attack on Titan" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and weirdly "Code Geass" in
some sense with the whole, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Britannian and all that stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And didn't really land
it with any of them, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for me personally, like, I
didn't feel like it nailed it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but it got a second season, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so clearly it must have been-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I mean...
- I've heard... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - The second season is like
the second half of the story, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so it's kinda more, like,
just a continuation. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, I've only just
heard good things about-- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - There, we spoke about anime, okay? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Okay, I'm moving you
two to go on more anime, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> whatever you want.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you think I've been watching anime? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey watching anime?
- Joey, get out of here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do wanna watch...
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do wanna watch "Platinum End" though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I do want to watch.
- Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause it looks edgy, it looks fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, it is edgy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It looks dumb and fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've heard the ending of
that is like really bad though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- In terms of like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it looks fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It looks like the high rise invasion shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, it looks like it's bad, but also-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that what you look for nowadays? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know, I'm trying not
to be picky with anime, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because if I'm gonna be picky, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna be like Joey and
I'm not gonna watch anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause Joey's read all this shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I haven't read this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I'm like, I need to just stop reading </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> about stuff too much, and just
pick something, and watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then I did that
with "86" and I hated it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - I mean, that's the give and take. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - But that might happen
with "Platinum End". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's true.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then I feel like if
I've at least done that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can, then, at least, if
I get to eight episodes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I stop, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I probably have more to say
than if I watched 12 episodes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and be like, "Eh"
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I have more to think and I
have more to say about it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I can go onto the anime podcast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and talk about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why don't you watch,
like, something, like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know, Komi-san? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Why don't we do a thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> where we--
- I don't think, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> you'll enjoy Komi-san.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - We all--
- Komi-san, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor watching Komi-san? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wanna hear Connor
talking about Komi-san. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We should do an anime review, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like once a month </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> where we all have to
watch one different anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and present it like a book club. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, that's so much effort. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Joey's not gonna do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Can I do like a manga review? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - No. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> We gotta push an anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause we're an anime podcast.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> We're fucking talking about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't even think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> our viewers want that from us, honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's funny 'cause people will like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> people will have like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 95% of viewers who I swear, are like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "I get bored when they talk about anime" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And there's 5% of viewers are like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "I hate when they're talking about anime." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I fucking hate them, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they call themselves the anime podcast, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> what a fucking joke! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like our viewers have become </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like everyone around me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which is everyone was an ex-anime fan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and now everyone just
finds himself watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> anything but anime.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have noticed that, I think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the episodes that we talk about anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I think, perform worse than the ones </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we talk about normal stuff.
- [Joey] Yeah, they do. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> So people don't like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But it's weird because
the clips perform better. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes.
- So I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't let the fucking viewers
decide what we talk about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I talk about what I
wanna talk about, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's weird that,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's weird that, I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not weird because people will want, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people want us, I'm sure,
to talk about certain shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> and certain series. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'Cause that's just gonna perform better </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in a short lifespan, but as a whole, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah, people just wanna hear us talk shit </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and a chat about what's
been happening in our lives, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which right now has been not so much. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - This man's moving.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I've been moving and
it's almost done, okay? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It's almost done.
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - My setup's almost done.
- Its never almost done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You think it's done, right?
- [Garnt] Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You think it's done, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then there's something
else that pops up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How did you guys decide how
you wanna decorate your rooms? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, you know what the hardest-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm gonna sound like a
fucking robot right now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm just like, I look
at a blank canvas, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I know I'm meant to show my personality </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, what do I show? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> How do I show personality?
- Well okay, so-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Give me a blank space, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have no idea what to do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Here's what I did, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> In my head, all right, I've
got all these Jo-Jo posters, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a must, that's going
somewhere on the wall. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I've got these big ass walls, all right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So then I know that's going there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So then, I kind of have to
figure out what goes in between </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the posters or what
goes around the posters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it kind of
starts to kind of form, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I'm like, "Okay,
here's what I want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want soundproofing, I want carpet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want soundproof squares." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I have an idea of stuff I want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then it's kind
of putting it together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then thinking, "Okay,
how would it look like that?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you know my old room, it was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I want this thing on the wall, that's it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I want posters of this, this,
that, and I don't care." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - So for me, the problem is that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> my room and the rest of my house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is designed by two different people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> My room is-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But your room still looks good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, my room is good,
but like the way we, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> the way myself and Aki
think about interior design </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is completely like on the
opposite ends of the spectrum. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Question, would you
decorate your bedroom, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you lived alone? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> What would you decorate it with? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never decorated my bedroom-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I've never decorated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is why it's so fucking
difficult for me, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the way I approach interior-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, are you gonna
decorate your bedroom? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, oh no, my office, sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, so yeah,
- I go yeah, yeah, but I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the same kind of deal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where my approach to interior design </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is my, same approach I have
with, like, engineering. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's all about practicality, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's just not good
for interior design. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, I know,
'cause here's the thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here's my biggest problem
with trying to fill up my room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right now, my office is,
I know what looks bad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I don't know how to make it look good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - See, because like,
if you're an engineer, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when it comes to interior design, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like a programmer, where it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "If white wall equals true,
fill white wall with something." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, that's it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, there's no,
like, opinion of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, maybe I should put something here." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, no, if there's
a space on my wall, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm gonna find something to fill it up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, one thing that's
good about living in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is that Japan is extremely
focused on practicality </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of like, everything in your house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Everything has to be practical. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I kinda took a lot of that in mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I made my office, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna make an office tour video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> at some point, on my main channel, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where I just go through everything
that I did in the office, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause I think it's
really, I think I did... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm pretty happy in my office. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It took me, goddamn, forever though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So so, easy views. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the way it is.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But also I wanna talk about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it took me goddamn forever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> so I wanna get some value out of it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Took me two fucking weeks, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just to soundproof the fucking room. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But I think it's really easy
to decorate a room in Japan, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> when you can think more on,
like, practical sides of things. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, you're like,
"Okay, I want this here. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I want all my anime figures." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, but I
don't want them in just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, a cabinet, like a glass
one, because I wanna be able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to move it so I can access
the cupboards behind it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I don't want it on the
wall with all the posters, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> see them blocked up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's kind of like, "All right, so..." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's like 10,000 things
you got to consider, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you're just trying
to like compute them all, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but then at some point you
just gotta do something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and then see how it looks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] 'Cause-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And hope you didn't
waste your time and money. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because that's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> as I've just established,
I hate wasting time, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I'm just like, I just want
something that looks good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> I just don't know how to make it look good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without just trying it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What if I like rearrange all my furniture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> after I've just spent
all this time building it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and like, you know, doing my best setup </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then it just looks shit. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> What if it just looks shit? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Because like, I have a
bunch of like anime merch </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and like, I just don't know
how to make it look good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, I've tried putting my anime figures </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> on like a shelf or something
and I don't know why, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> I just don't think, having
a bunch of anime figures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the shelf looks good for my aesthetic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I say this, I said, it was all this shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I think it works for us, that's it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I dunno if we came to this by
luck or if it just, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, so the way Aki does it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which I think is kind of genius, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is that what she does is,
when we first moved in, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, "I'm gonna do my room, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> you do the rest of the house." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'Cause you clearly have a
better sense of it than I do. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So what she does is she took
photos of the empty room </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then she would go into Photoshop </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and literally just Photoshop
in different things </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> that she was thinking to buy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like, move it around and if-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I don't have
(indistinct), holy shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - And if it looks good, then she buys it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and puts it exactly where
she envisioned it to be. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> And because then you know.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - What it looks like before you bought it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, it's kinda big brain. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Buy what you need, measure it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, one thing I've, like, noticed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> around anime merch now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> now that I'm like trying to
make my room actually look cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So a lot of anime merch
just looks really tacky. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And I didn't like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't realize this until
now that I've moved to Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> and we've got like some cooler
things, but like I was like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> maybe I'll try putting
some wall scrolls up </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> and now like--
- One star. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Even wall scrolls, just look like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've graduated from wall scrolls. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, hello, I have been
to an anime convention </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that is the look, when you
put up wall scrolls now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've never understood
the appeal of wall scrolls. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll be honest.
- [Joey] Me neither. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They look shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] I mean, I did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - There are like, you know, like, posters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You can get them framed.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then they look so clean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> So like, symmetrical
as well, so beautiful. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then the nice glass panel or plastic, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> whatever the fuck it is.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you've got this like
poorly printed piece of paper </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with two plastic scrolls
at the top and the bottom. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And its never like fucking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the string just looks so tacky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The string looks really tacky. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - We're just calling out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone who has fucking
wall scrolls right now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> which is so many people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel I went through that phase though, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so I understand. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I went through the wall
scroll and poster phase </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> and I'm like, "I liked it at the time." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> But then when I learned
about like, framed stuff, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that's when I was like, "Oh." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But here's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Those JoJo posters that I have, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're $13 per poster, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously it's in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then the frame is like 12 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like 25 bucks for
a clean ass, massive, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like really high quality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's cheaper than a lot of
- Wall scrolls. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
(crosstalk) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like sometimes 30 to a box. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> We're talking like even the A4 ones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes they're 20 bucks, fuck that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I won't pay on that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're always like, they
always don't look as good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, the print is never as clean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I don't know, man,
I just, I don't see a-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm past the wall
scroll phase as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is why, I had wall
scrolls in my old office </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> and I'm just like, this just looks tacky, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but I don't know how to, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what I wanna replace it with. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Wall scrolls.
- And now, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm going for that problem, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where I have to figure out
what I wanna replace it with. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, I have like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so, it's just so--
- You live in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can get these.
- Because like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - B4 prints. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I've done like one
cool thing with my office. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I have like a
few cool anime merch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What if I just put this
all in a glass case?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I bought like a glass case, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is like a four-component glass case, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I filled up, like, the top
one was the junji ito bag </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I got. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> The second one was like
all the anime watches </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that I've got as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Third case was all the wine, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all the wine equipment or
the anime wine equipment </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that me and Sydney have collected. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And the fourth case is going to be </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> for the Slam Dunk Air Jordans
that I found on Yahoo auction. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And I put it up and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> "Damn, this looks awesome."
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And then I realized
that's like one 100th </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> of the entire fucking room.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck!
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That means you've got to
start collecting more stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm just like, oh, it looks cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, it's like compared... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, putting it next to everything else, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it just looks so empty now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Damn, that one 10th
of my room looks epic. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know, right?
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The people, when they
rob your house, man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're going right for that cabinet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The entire Garnt Maneetapho wealth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is stored in one glass full cabinet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like you've been collecting JoJo figures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or JoJo fucking merch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, this is
how my collection starts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It starts with one cabinet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- My God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nah, I bought one of those. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't buy a glass cabinet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I wanted to be able to move it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause it's blocking my cupboards, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I bought one on wheels </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that I can just kinda
like shove out the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, one thing I
definitely underestimated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was how heavy glass is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, extremely so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why?
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What made you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah.
- No, no, well I mean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That looks light. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I felt like there was
another point coming down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I was...
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - You literally just
went, "Glass is heavy." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah, I was waiting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Why did you learn this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What made you realize this?
- Okay, because... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - Garnt goes glass heavy.
- Because... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's all.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> My point was that glass
was heavy and I did not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like, did not--
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What, you didn't think it was heavy? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I didn't.
- It's fucking glass. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't think about this, okay? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think about this shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait, I think everyone
knows glass is heavy, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> because--
- Water is wet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because like one big issue I've had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with living in a house now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> is that you have to carry things upstairs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And luckily enough, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my office is on the ground floor </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I had the choice between </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> mine being on the ground floor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and mine being on the top floor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, "I want
a glass case," obviously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> once I got the glass case delivered, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like, "Was
glass always this heavy?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I don't know how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I was meant to carry this
upstairs, if I needed to, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but thank God I didn't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Damn, glass in Japan
is really fucking heavy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So that was my story, Garnt
discovers that glass is heavy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Garnt discovers that glass is heavy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hey man, I saw, picked up
a look at this metal thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "Shit,
metal's kinda heavy." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow.
- Damn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Damn, okay, fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, that was one thing definitely, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when I was designing my
office, where I realized, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I thought I had a lot of stuff, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> but then, I realized that a lot of it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was stuff that was on my wall, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was things like
posters and wall scrolls, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I was like, "You know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe it's time to change it up." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So then I got really picky </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> with what I would put on the walls, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> So now I go like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my junji ito bag or what the fuck, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your skateboards, you know,
my YouTube play button </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> and stuff like that, you know
stuff that is more limited </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> and like extravagant looking.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I realized, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I actually don't have a lot of stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is actually of value.
- [Connor] Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then I went on this like crack binge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of buying expensive shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Now, I have the reverse problem </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> where I have too much stuff now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> So I have to... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Your room is just like
the weeb haven, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - My room is, I have somehow,
I don't know when it happened, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> but I've turned into, like,
a snobby art collector </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when it comes to like weeb shit-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I'm going through that stage </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> where I'm like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I haven't got there
yet, I'm just like, Jojo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just give JoJo stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like every time I go
into an exhibit now, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm just like, "so where are
the expensive paintings?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Fuck the mugs or the posters.
- What anime does to you man? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Fuck the T-shirts, fuck the mugs. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't want your
fucking figures anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- I don't want the posters, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't want the fucking wall scrolls. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, no, I don't want any shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Where are the paintings?
- Give me the cool shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, where's the limited shit? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Exactly, right?
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What can I frame?
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> What can I display in the glass box? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - We got to do the anime
figure special, at some point, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you guys are saying this
shit, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I love figures still, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> JoJo (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'll walk into like a figurine shop </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'll be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "So were there more than
a hundred of these made?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want it.
- Wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You gonna love this shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You privilege is showing, Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Does this come with a
certificate of authenticity? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> The wealth has gone to this man's head. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - But the thing about figures is that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> you just need a fuck ton of
it, before it looks any good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Otherwise it just looks
a little bit tacky, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> because it's too small
to be a centerpiece, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> but it needs to occupy, like, some space, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And it just looks, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unless you have like a
really, really massive figure, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to me, it doesn't like, it's-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - But even then like, a
really, really big figure </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> can still look a little tacky
depending on where it is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's where I was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause, I have that like
massive, bezerk figure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah, you do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm still to this day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to figure out where to put it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it's like, everywhere,
I've like, envisioned it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> putting it in my room, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just doesn't look
right, for some reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I realize it might be
because I need to have it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> next to a bunch of other figures. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- But the problem is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> my biggest shelf is like,
tucked away in a corner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So I can't, put it in.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm like, well fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to like, put this,
like, shit in the living room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like...
- Coffee table, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Coffee table. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, just take the whole coffee table. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't this like that
fucking, what's that word </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's used to describe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> how the energy of a room is dictated by-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Feng Shui.
- Feng Shui. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm trying to figure out the Feng Shui </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> of my giant Beserk. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - As a kid, I'm just
like, "This is stupid." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That they're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can just put things
and it doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Now I've realized, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "Well, my mood is affected
by how my room looks." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, why is... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wouldn't go that
far personally, for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like,
(Connor mumbling) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Feng Shui, though it does
get pretty ridiculous at times. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like you'll get bad luck if the-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some of that is
ridiculous, but I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even like my bedroom, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause like, I sleep better now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because our bedroom is
orientated differently </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> from my old bedroom. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I just realize, oh, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's just 'cause of where it is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> in relation to where the
window is and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where was it before?
- Huh? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Was it not near a window last time? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it wasn't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like on the opposite
side of the window. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey snickering) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] That probably
wouldn't have helped. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Generally, I think,
seeing light outside is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> make your brain happier.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Normally, brain like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For me like, 'cause back
then, I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Where can the bed take up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the most efficient amount of space?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Right in that corner,
right away from the window. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- [Garnt] I'm just like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, If you have room
to put it in the middle, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you put it in the middle, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then that's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like a big brain
saying, like, "I have space." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, that's a flex. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know, these
other sides of the beds. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't even need them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Nothing needs to go there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna put the bed in the middle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- I know, it's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> This is the first time I've actually like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> try to, think about this,
rather than just like, going-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Man discovers interior design. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, man discovers interior design. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For me it was like, "Oh man,
I got more space on my wall, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> guess I'll buy more JoJo prints. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll buy double. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So now I have double the
JoJo prints on my walls. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I've got a nice,
really cool wall of JoJos, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's really nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What have you done with,
like, the rest of your merch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you built up, at your place? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, this is JoJo?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's all on one like four-shelf rack. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Managed to place it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I put like the
anti-earthquake things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the figures that fall over. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I managed to somehow get it all in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then I've got a bunch of
other stuff in other cupboards </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> that I can't like, display. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, I have like, a
really big, wooden, oak box </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> filled with the Jojo ties,
- [Garnt] Oh, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Separate and like neat and presentable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But there's nowhere to put it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like,
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't just put it on the floor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the Jojo ties, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this can't go on the floor, you're insane? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Lose its value. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly, I own 14 or
15 something JoJo ties. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Literally, every JoJo
tie that's ever been made. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I actually don't, there's like 24. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I have all of the
ones from part four, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is 12 ties in total.
- Holy shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's 12. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So there's 12 ties from part four, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think there's like eight
or something from part five. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't buy all of them from part five. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know like when are your kid, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you'd see that documentary
about that guy or girl, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> who would collect like
Barbie dolls and Ken dolls? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You've become that, but
just with Jojo, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have not, don't you dare. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> No, 'cause they-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fast forward to like Connor in 50 years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - They would go around,
they would dress up like Ken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like, "I'm Ken." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And they'd be like, "Please call me Ken." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You literally, you carry where you go, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you have a fucking JoJo suit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You wear a JoJo suit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, come on, that's, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the only
piece of dress you own. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is the meme where it's
like, we are not the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You wear a Ken outfit, I wear a Jojo suit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're not the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Garnt wipes his ass, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I pressure wash my ass, we
are not the same, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't compare, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't compare me to those
fucking people who cosplay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We are not the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wear drip, they wear
outfits, it's not the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wearing one suits, everywhere you go, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> does not count as drip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone looks good in suits. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Five suits Garnt, five-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everyone looks good in a fucking suit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everyone looks good in a suit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not, no, they don't, no they don't, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> No, they don't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You'd have to be something
like really, really bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to fuck up looking good in the suit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You could, you could do it.
(Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do it.
- How? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let me think about that.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Look bad in general, I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just be really ugly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just get a bad-fitting suit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but if-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you know, you get
one too long, too short. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wear your dad's suit,
that's pretty much-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, wear your dad's suit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - But if it's fitted then
everyone looks good, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Gee, I don't wanna concede
this point, 'cause-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause then I'm admitting
its the power of the suits. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am sticking by this point, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I can't remember, someone did like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> an Anituber drip tier list or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't remember who it was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I remember you were like... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think, Mudan did one, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't think it was Mudan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause whoever this person--
- Oh, the first one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, the first one, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> whoever this person was like,
put Connor in like S-tier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Connor does not deserve to
go in fucking S-tier drip, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he just wears one fucking Jojo suit, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and calls it a day. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Everyone is blinded by the
Jojo suit, that is not drip. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And I just say, it should be, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a good suit, it looks-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - If everyone had a Jojo suit,
everyone would be in S-tier. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well then everyone should
get a JoJo suit, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's not drip. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just you wait. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want to start a charity service </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to give everyone a JoJo suit
to move you down the drip tier. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> That's how much I care about this shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - And yeah, I saw that, I saw that-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm gonna come back in a
few weeks with more drip. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I saw that TLS video, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and when they put Connor on
S-Tier because of the JoJo suit, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, this man
literally is in a S-tier </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> while wearing an Emia like shirt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, how the fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're gonna say, you're gonna tell me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the same fucking Emia shirts that he wears </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> on like every other week of Trash Taste </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> puts him in S-tier on drip. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That is...
- I'm leaving. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like, I got fucking
B-tier compared to this pawn, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to this person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Boy, you are B-tier drip,
man, get off my S-tier. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no, what's worse is that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was also S-tier but
I worked for my shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I actually have like a
wardrobe full of shit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and I get beaten by one JoJo suit, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> which I also have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, which we all fucking heard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You should get five
then, shouldn't you Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> And then we'll talk. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You have one JoJo suit, I have five, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> we are not the same, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - The weeb standard of drip is so low </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what I wanted to add. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's 'cause-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not normally salty
but that day I was salty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was the day, when I
was like, "What this fuck?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is my confirmation
that weebs do not have drip. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Every time I post
pictures in the Jojo suit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the perfect suit factory,
the maker of the suit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> posts it to their Instagram. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do they actually?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I couldn't believe it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> At least twice they've done it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, "Oh, okay, cheers." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> They're like, "Look, this is drip." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - See, the makers of the suit agree. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> I should be, I am drip. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't think they post--
- They made the suit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't think they re-posting it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> because they think it's drip, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I think they're re-posting it
because they fucking made it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no, no, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> they're re-posting 'cause
they're like, "Shit, man." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - They're like this post got viral. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We buy wierd Daiso socks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and put it up on an Instagram post. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sure Daiso would re-tweet it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they won't say, "This is drip." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> They'll say thank you for buying
our fucking 100 Yen socks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, let's watch
it happen then, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, no, I'm not going to go-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why not? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> No, no.
- I don't wear Daiso socks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - You all wish, I'll buy you a pair. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck Daiso socks, its
all about the Family Mart. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's all about the fucking Family Mart. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you wearing it now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's all about the Family Mart socks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have we ever talked about this before? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - No.
- [Joey] I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So Joey and Garnt came to me
one day and they were like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Have you worn Family Mart socks before?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Family Mart socks, which
is a convenience store, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously, in Japan.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "No, why would
I wear Family Mart socks?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause they were amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "They're the most
comfortable socks on earth". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "All right, okay." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So one of my gaijin friends living here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, told me about this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, revelation being
like, "Have you heard?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> He came to me like fucking
Jehovah's Witnesses, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like, "Have you heard of
the Family Mart socks?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I was like, "No, please do tell" . </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, I
think, like the 400 yens, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like three, four
bucks, for a pair of socks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> And I was like, "How good
could a $4 pair of socks be </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> at a convenience store of all places?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> Wore it, felt like I was floating, bro. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Literally, and then I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have to tell, it was
like, I am totally into it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, you got turned into a, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> a Jehovah's witness.
- Yeah, I was converted. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - He starts preaching to me about this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I was around his house, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I was around his house, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I would play Mahjong, and
he starts preaching to me. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm just like, it's just
fucking socks, Joey. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> Aki comes back with
like five pairs of socks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then he goes, "Yeah, I'll
give you one for free." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "I don't need
this, it's a pair of socks." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's literally the
guy giving the Bibles, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> just give it a go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> What am I gonna do with this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> And I remember I got home and
put it on when the corner. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I remember we had a Trash
Taste recording the other day, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I hadn't done my
washing the day before, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I opened my drawer,
empty sock drawer, except </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> for the one Family Mart sock,
and he always, he was just, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> he was just staring me in
the face and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh fine, I'll wear
the Family Mart socks." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like, there's this one
scene from "Rick and Morty" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where Rick gives Morty like
the perfectly flats piece </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of land, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you remember that scene? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember where. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where it's like perfectly
flat and Morty's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, what is this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, it's just perfectly funny." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He steps on it, and he
literally starts coming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Oh, it's
just fucking so, so good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> how good could this be?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I put it on and I'm just
like, "Oh, it fits so snugly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's hugging my feet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is this feeling? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is this, cotton? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so soft." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like I'm walking on ship right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What is this?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I answer, and I text Joey, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, "Fuck you." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I was like, I have
done, I have converted it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why it feels so smooth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and so silky smooth on your skin. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I can't wear any of those socks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - It feels like a thousand
kisses on your feet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - My favorite pair of socks,
I bought two years ago, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's from Lawson's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Telling you, they do a black pair </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of socks and they are like
the cleanest socks I own. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are they as good as
the Family Mart socks? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think they're better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I bought these socks, for two years, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been washing them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We have the Family
Mart gospel right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They have not lost their
like, their firmness, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they haven't worn out at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, as soon as you
get socks to go crinkly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they go hard after a
while when you wash them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> because they've been used so much, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> these socks, fucking warriors, bro. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They're like day one,
they look no different. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> These socks are amazing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - (indistinct) mad brother,
but he's just lost his way. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> He's lost his way, we will guide
you to the right direction. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You guys give me a pair of Family Mart, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll give you guys pair of
the Lawson's blacks I have, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you'll see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Trash Taste sock rating. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You'll see, these socks are impeccable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so insane because
I remember walking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into a Family Mart in Tokyo the other day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they literally had a table just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> for the Family Mart socks by themselves, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which just shows how far
the gospel was spread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They've literally got a table, front </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> and center in the combination. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, that's because they're
probably always sold out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like every, I think
I've been to about four </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> or five different Family
Marts, after I'd try the socks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, "I have to get more." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was like scouting around Tokyo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I swear, for the first
four or five Family Marts, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they were all sold out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm curious, what made you
buy them in the first place? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's just like a thing that started </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> with like, guidance living in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like one, yeah, one of the
foreign is those leaving key, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, posted on Twitter about like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> trying out these Family Mart socks, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then it kind of just
spread like wildfire from it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then it made its way to me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Man Off Camera] Yeah,
it's the Family Mart socks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and the pumpkin spice latte combo. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, that's right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - And what was pumpkin spice latte got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to do with these? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Man Off Camera] Starbucks,
it's a Gaijin thing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, because pumpkin
spice lattes in the spot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Spice latte has only just
now become really massive </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> in Japan because of the (indistinct). </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I guess the same thing happened </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> with the Family Mart socks, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> and so everyone was like, "All right, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> let me tell you full
bucks, I'll try it out." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> And then the gospel spread. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm like, "This is, I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this is how religion stuff (laughs). </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Through (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Says it's good, and
then the rest follow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - One sock at a time, religion spread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - This episode is sponsored by Honey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know how these podcasts ads to go, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we read a spiel, blah, blah, blah, blah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's in the script as well, by the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then we give you a
promo code or a discount, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then that's the end of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But this time it is
different (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because this is an ad for Honey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And our Honey ad doesn't just give you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one promo code, a Honey
ad gives you millions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of promo codes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> That's right, millions of
promo codes in one address. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - All right, so when you shop, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Honey will automatically
fill in the promo code box </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for you to check out, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it won't just fill
it in with one code, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it'll dump a ton of codes in there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> My God, every code it can fit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know you know zero codes, Joey. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It knows more than zero codes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Then it tests them in seconds to see </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if one gives you a discount, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and plus, Honey knows what
to look for promo codes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that are hard to find on your own. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was buying your Christmas
presents, spoiler alert. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I might've used Honey to get
myself a bit of a discount. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You cheap shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - So get all the promo
codes Honey can find </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> at joinhoney.com/trashtaste, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's joinhoney.com/trashtaste, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> link's in the description below. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Fuck you, Garnt (indistinct). </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Going back on the topic
of watching stuff though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So as I have been watching anime again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanted to know if you have
had the same experience, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where do the subtitles
actively distract you now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from like, what's going on? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - In English? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, if you have English subtitles on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sometimes, I can turn
off the part of my brain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that's trying to listen to the Japanese. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I can just ignore that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like, I, because like I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this was the first time
I started watching anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for my video, and of
course, I turn on subtitles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I had to understand
what was going on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I've been watching anime as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> for like a long period of
time without subtitles, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was so weird turning it back on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it like actively,
I actually dislike it now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it actively distracts me
from what's going on-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - (indistinct) any anime
with subtitles now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm trying not to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You have become next level (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm like, trying to watch as much anime </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> without subtitle subtitles on. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, because like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what I've realized is that it actually, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it actively hurts your
language learning process </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if you have English subtitles on well, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or at least here's the way-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Here's the way I see it, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause say you have like
a Japanese sentence, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or hear a Japanese sentence </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you want the English
translation of that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> If the translator for the
subtitle is doing their job, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they would have translated
what they're saying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into natural English, so
that it sounds natural. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Whereas when I'm trying to learn Japanese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm trying to process
the Japanese in my head, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what I've read in the subtitles, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and what's being said are
like all the same things, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's different. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I would actually, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like, I realized this where I
think it would be more useful </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for me if I had Google
translated subtitles </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> than an actual, like
professionally translated subtitle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because when I'm going back
and I'm trying to understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something and I read the
official translation, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, "Well, yeah,
that," and I, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I do my work to translate it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Yeah, that's what's being said, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but that's not how I think
about that sentence being heard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in my brain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - But that's also like the problem, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Is that I think at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like, so much of it is nuanced </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> because grammatically
it's just so different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> A lot of it is just completely, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've read some subtitles where
it's just being completely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> lost in translation because
there are just some things. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So some phrases and ways
of saying a sentence </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and the way of describing something </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that is so specifically Japanese, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that if the translator
tries to translate it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> without the translator notes,
you have to explain it, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> then it just becomes like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it becomes so nuance to the
point that it almost becomes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> like a subjective
translation where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I personally think this is
what they're trying to say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's not true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> A hundred percent the same. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I feel that if people
try and use that as a way </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to learn grammar, then they're
going to get one nuanced way </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> of learning it, which
is not exactly accurate. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, when I was
watching the American films </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen in Japan, they
have the Japanese subtitles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's really interesting. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Joey] Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, that would be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, a really heavy amount of slang, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'll just translate it
into something extremely simple </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and mundane, but it doesn't really convey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> the situation (indistinct). </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But obviously, it works
all the way around as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But like, I watch, actually, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> you know it's quite helpful
watching Japanese TV, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they have subtitles in Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the screen every goddamn two seconds, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rip editors, but yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they have the subtitles on
screen and I find it way easier </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to watch Japanese stuff
with Japanese subtitles. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because I know, I know
a fair amount of Kanji, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like basic stuff, so I
can normally kind of, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it really helps me solidify the sentence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because often I just, I'm just intaking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I don't see anything
to kind of like lay it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And when I'm hearing stuff
and I can see the line, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can kind of be like, "Oh,
that's what he's saying." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because there's some words
that can mean like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like, you wanna say
tata, like source tata, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then like tata can mean
like so many different things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in so many different contexts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If when there could be like advice, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It could be like a recommendation of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> oh, you should do this right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So it's really confusing because sometimes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you stop paying
attention for one second </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then you hear something like tata, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then you're panicking, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> figuring out what way
they're using this word, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that could mean so many things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so it's really confusing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then having the subtitles in Japanese, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, okay, well, I just saw the first part, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, glanced at the second part, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can figure out what's going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think every language
is like that though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Even in English, where it's
like the word of, for instance, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it can mean a million
different things depending </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on the sentence. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And Japanese, I think is just
like a little more difficult </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because you know it again,
like unlike in English, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> where there is spaces between words </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that clearly distinguished
between what this word means, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> versus what this next word means, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> in Japanese, we don't have that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just one continuous flow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I remember the first
time I saw like, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I opened like a Japanese light novel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or something and I'm just like,
"This fucking terrifies me." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just one continuous line of text, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, "What's--" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The only thing that stops
it is a comma or a period. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And then everything else
is still so nonstop. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've never thought I
could get terrified by it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, just letters before, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> until I opened like a
Japanese novel, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "This is just one line,
where's the separation?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Come on guys." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like this is
a very small nitpick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know how? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Because obviously in Japanese, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> The subject comes first. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So more often than not when
they're like explaining </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like plot twists in anime, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's so hard to like hype it up </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> because the subject comes first, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's like, gone, the
killer or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the killer was
gone, it's always like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Actually, in Japanese, we can do that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, we can do that way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, you know, for example, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Moda mystery stories in
Japanese do this a lot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, you know, normally
if someone were to say like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you're the culprit, in English,
we can do the same thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can say the culprit is you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or you're the culprit, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, the same thing in Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I were to say "You're
the culprit," in that order, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that'd be (speaks in Japanese)
versus (speaks in Japanese). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You're the culprit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Which one sounds more natural though? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Because like-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - They're both natural. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, because what I noticed
about English is that-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just source of Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, but what I've
noticed is that, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the translation, it,
with translating the Japanese, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like natural English or some
English that reads naturally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, sometimes you can get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the same meaning across in English, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just sounds really Jahnke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And especially with how
the sentence structure, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the Japanese grammar is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sounds like languages are
like nothing alike, fudge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not every language is like English. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - As like learning the second, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because like, obviously,
we've all had second languages </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that we've never really learned </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as learning like a third language </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for you made you appreciate
(indistinct) more. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A hundred percent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A hundred percent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Straight up, no, not really
like, yeah, for sure. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I took it for granted,
but then again, like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I also feel like God, I've like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I never, ever wanted to learn, in my mind, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> I always have the mindset
of like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know this is very close
minded, but I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just gonna not speak English, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I already hate the language,
I thought that way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I still, to this day,
I hate learning languages. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, I'm fucking tryna learn a third. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> What's up with that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> What's up with that, man? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna learn a third language, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just don't really
have the time right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The problem is that you
won't like, (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> unless you're like one of those
people who's just obsessed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with languages and learning them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, I feel like you will
only learn the other language </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you need to, which is the
only reason why I'm doing it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, I'm finally at a point </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where I know people like online, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> there was one, there are
high Japanese and stuff, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's so hard to convey
how your Japanese is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> when you don't need to speak it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't wanna speak it online sometimes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause it's embarrassing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, Chris will always try
and get my fucking Japanese. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I know why Chris is fucking doing it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause he wants to feel
good about his Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Motherfucker, 'cause
obviously, Chris's Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is better than mine, like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not by much though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I see Chris, he has no problem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in conveying a lot of like, thoughts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - When I'm with him, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> he'll do anything he can
to not speak Japanese. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the same thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - (indistinct) I wanna
do it in front of you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's embarrassing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause he's gonna feel like
I've been here for eight years, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I should speak better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever amount you wanna
learn, you can learn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> Even though I wanna get better, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I've gotten to a point now
where I can pretty much do </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> everything, except for
government documents. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Everything is not problem-- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can barely do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - I can go to the bank, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> that's how I know my
fluency is increasing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> As somebody who came here
literally knowing nothing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm pretty proud of where I've
come from, how far I've come. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, you know, it is,
again, it fucking sucks online. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause people expect you to
like, reach a certain level </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> by a certain time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sometimes I forget what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sometimes I forget a
word that I should know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes I forgot an easy word. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm exactly the same, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> where like it's I was putting in hours, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, every single day for
like, a good, like two, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> three month periods. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I went back to England, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like going to the
gym where you build up this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you build up this routine
and you're like, great, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm doing this routine." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then something comes along
to fuck over that routine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then like, it just
cascades and you miss a day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you miss two days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you miss a week and you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Fuck, now I'm starting
to forget (indistinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, that's where I'm at now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where like, I was making
such good progress, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I went to New England,
and then it just cascaded, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, trying to
have to put the effort </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in to relearn some of the
stuff that I knew before, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and now I've just forgotten </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I wasn't putting the
active hours in every day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have, speaking of gym, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> I have really fucking
struggled to get back into it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, it is hard. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I forgot how hard it was
to get back into the gym </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> if you fall out because you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're going every week, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't really get
sore the next day much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It doesn't really happen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because you're pretty
eating the right thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your body's used to you doing it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like, I rarely got like very sore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now when I go, I'm sore
for like four days, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I haven't gone a month. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> So you combine that with like,
also having a busy schedule, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I wanna go more, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but you need to go at least once a week </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or more to kind of build it up, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But now if I'm sore for four days, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm not gonna go for these four days. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> And I gotta pray that
my schedule isn't full </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the other two days that
I'm able, and I want to go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But of course, life isn't like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and most of the time, I'm doing something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've got to go somewhere for shoots, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's like, fuck man, I'm really trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get back into this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but it is so goddamn hard to get back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into the gym as an adult
when you fall out of it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is so difficult, because
most people just aren't used </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to making a lot of time for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's something that I
will not empty my schedule </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> to go to the gym. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> To me, it's like, I
know I should exercise, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I enjoy it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I really love going, but I
wanna do everything else first, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna prioritize my work first, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I'll go to the gym. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it's just being an adult. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you signed up to a gym? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have them not signed up to a gym. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, like-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Are you going to? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Probably not. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I kind of had this realization
where the little free time </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that we have to work with, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm either gonna go to the
gym or I'm gonna use that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to learn Japanese. And I chose, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I made the active choice to be like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to put whatever free time I have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into learning Japanese, that's my choice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I'm not, like I, before
I was like, "I can do both, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've got time to do both,"
and then what I realized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that I didn't have time to do both, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And by trying to do both, I didn't either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I knew I needed to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause the thing is, either
with gym or language learning, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think discipline is
the most important thing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, the idea is nice, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if I could go into the gym
every week or every day, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> or putting an hour of whatever you want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into learning Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's not gonna happen
if you're not gonna like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> commit to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you need to just be
like strict with yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like, "This is
going to go beyond me," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just having this idea of I
wanting to do this thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and me just putting in
like the real hours to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think one thing that I, took this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from (indistinct) as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is what he said. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And honestly, it really resonated with me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He said that like, he goes
to the gym a bunch, right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously, because he's
an absolute human machine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> (indistinct) on this man
is literally like, insane. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> He was like, and I, and to this day, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like, I still firmly believe this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> He was like, "Even if you have
the shittest day on earth, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you go to the gym and you work out, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> you've done something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You've actively feel like
you've made some progress </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> on something. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And like, you know, work
doesn't have to go right, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> your relationships don't have to go right, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but at least you had that
one thing that you've done </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that was good for you. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And to be honest, when you go to the gym, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like, the one thing I
really loved about it, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> and this is part of the
reason I go is 'cause the day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I like to go in the morning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really like going at night, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not really my thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I go to the gym in the morning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the rest of the day is like, amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, my energy is high, I feel great, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the next, I sleep well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I normally have a good
next day too, as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So I just find that
everything improves when I go, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why I do like going,
the fuck is it hard to do it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I like, this year, I opted
to get up at like, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> around like, eight or 9:00 AM, 9:00 AM-- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll be doing that as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - And even if I got
barely any fucking sleep </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the night before, even if I
went to bed at like 3:00 AM, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> I always try and get up at
least like, 9:00 AM latest, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because I know that in
between 9:00 AM and lunch, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> if I get something done before lunch, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, "I got something
done, it's just lunchtime." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's such a simple life hack where like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> waking up early-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wake up early. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - (indistinct) Y'all you'll feel better </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> if you wake up early. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> As a kid, I'm like, "Shut
up, let me stay up till--" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fuck you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - "Let me stay up till 5:00
AM playing video games, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> see how that hurts me." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I know, who knew that it hurts you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It hurts you, oh, it hurts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the one good thing about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's two sides of this coin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So if you are waking up
at nine all the time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> even if you go to bed at like 5:00 AM, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you have like, a night out, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you'll probably still wake up at nine, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause your body is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is time to wake up, get up now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I have been, you feel shit all day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but at least you still
maintain the sleep schedule, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But on the other side,
I remember when I used </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to wake up at like one or 2:00 PM, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's not my proudest of days. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think we've all been there, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would wake up at this time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> One good thing was that,
one, I normally just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't eat as much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I found that when I'm awake
all day, I'm eating a lot more, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's good or bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wonder why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I'm just having more shit to do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I would eat less, 'cause
I would just eat a meal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> at like, eight and then I
would go to bed at 4:00 AM. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> But the other thing is when
I go out with my friends </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and we're going drinking, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm getting really tired by like 10. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Fuck, (indistinct)." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember when I would
wake up at two, we went out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd be like, 4:00 AM, "Are you both good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm still good to go, man,
let's go to this party, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> let's keep going." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And everyone's like, "Oh,
I'm so tired, I gotta go, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got work tomorrow." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Let's keep
going, let's keep partying." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then now I'm that guy who's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Dude, it's like 9:00 PM,
man, I gotta get back soon." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, sad, man, I
can't, it's so hard for me-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember when I first, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when we first started coming to Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like, me and Joey had this
thing, where every time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I would come, we would do
like Oni karaoke, every time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every single fucking time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, twice a week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, we're gonna have to do
that when people come here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God, can we go in the morning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and just go all the way
until like 10:00 PM in this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I hope he's right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Content creators who wanna
come on Trash Tastes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> your (indistinct) on Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a very, very small
amount of people watching this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you come here, please, don't all come </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the same time, I'm begging, please. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're gonna die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's gonna happen though,
when the country opens up, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just gonna be a,
like a mass fucking people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just coming in the country. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I saw people on Twitter
were like, talking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were like, "Any other
content creators wanna arrange </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> a trip to Japan with the foot,
when it opens up right away?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "Please, no." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Come and smoke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - At let's not do the all
night karaoke, 'cause like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> man, that morning, that train home </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or that taxi home or that, whatever, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> however the fuck you get home, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like the most depressing
thing in the world. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Dude, when I was coming back
from your housewarming party, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like, 2:00 AM on a taxi, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, "God, I wanna die." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> It was the most depressing
taxi I've been on in so long. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's just something about
going home after a night out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> when you can see the
sun, that is just like-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That is like, "What am I doing?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm like, you're walking in the streets </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're just like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone else is going to work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you're like, "Look
at all these people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> with an adequate amount of
sleep in their body, fuck them." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel homeless. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like a homeless
man roaming the streets. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God, yeah, I remember that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I used to go out to like 4:00
AM when I first came here. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> I liked that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was good times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Those fun times, but-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can still do it, I got it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, everyone's got to agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It needs to be like, to
me, like, we used to do it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on a whim, but now I'm
like, it needs to be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We all got to agree, we're
like, this is a hard one, boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We're going hard, we're
all gonna get drunk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got to like go to sleep
really early the night before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so I can get like enough sleep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before my waking up at 8:00 AM. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, because like, for me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I luckily, like, if I want to stay up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I can stay up really easily, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but what that just means
is I just lose a day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just, I lose a day
if I stay up late now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, my actions have consequences. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - At every part of-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is this motherfucker who's last alive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He's always the one up until like seven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like to, sometimes I, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't really get much
(indistinct) anymore at parties, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really feel
like I have to stay up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Once I'm done, I'm like, "Later, guys," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> If I'm the first to go to sleep, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm the first to go to
sleep, no qualms about it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> It's whatever my body is
saying, I'm like, "Later, guys." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> Especially if I need to
do something the next day </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or they wanna hang out again the next day, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I wanna be awake to like
spend time with you guys. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) I must stay awake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I dunno, it's just when
people are there, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I wish to converse now,
I wish to socialize." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, that I do feel
a bit if (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If I haven't seen my
friends in ages, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I really want to talk to you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm so tired, so I'm gonna go to bed." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> It's like, if it's just
like a regular night, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I'm like, I could stay up </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and do whatever I'm
doing until like 4:00 AM, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but then I think to myself, I'm like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> "This is shit I can just
do tomorrow morning." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> So now it's like, "I
don't have to do it now." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I mean, it's different,
like if it's like friends </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I hadn't seen in a while,
I'll fucking stay up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh yeah, that is like the
one exception where I'm like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah, I'll be having be having
(indistinct) like 5:00 AM. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It was just like a normal nights out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these lads who I see every week, I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "Guys, I'm getting a bit tired--" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - "I'm gonna see you next week." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "I'm going to bed, fuck you." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I need a piss quickly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my, God-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm sorry, I didn't take one last time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when we had a long break. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This man has a woman bladder. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_07> come and hang out with us, see you then. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Make sure you hit that Follow button. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Going back to like,
languages and stuff though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I did have this thought
and I don't mean to like sound </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> elitist or gatekeep something else, but-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you think you can
truly understand the culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you don't like, have
at least like a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of an understanding of the language? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Because what made me think
this was, learning Japanese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> has really made me appreciate
Thai and Thai culture, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and made me think about my own language </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or my second language in a way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I never thought about before. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because to me, learning a
language or like, learning Thai </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was just the way I communicated to my mom, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it didn't like, I didn't
internalize just how much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of my culture was steeped into
my language until I started </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to try learning Japanese. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And you know, like, like we just said, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can translate things, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You can translate ideas, but one thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I've found learning Japanese, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or like, now I appreciate
in time was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes it's really hard to
translate a certain feeling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you get from a phrase. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think it's impossible
to learn a language </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> without learning the
culture, and vice versa. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think you can learn the language </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without knowing anything
about the culture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Really? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't think you can. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think you can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - But I mean, what's the point? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - But you can't, but like, I think, yeah, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of course, you can,
'cause it's a set of rules </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> and you, you follow them
and you say the words like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because, you know, I did, but like-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can teach a robot language, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't have to understand
the culture behind it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it knows-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a robot, what
I'm saying is that like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> well, if that can be done,
that shows that, I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't need to understand the culture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you don't have to
understand the culture, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think if you
wanna, on the other hand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you wanna understand
more about the culture, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now your question was
knowing the culture, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I think if you wanna
know more about the culture, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the language is probably
the best way to do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I would argue that they
kind of, they go hand in hand. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I feel because the language
of a country is a culture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's like, I feel like,
yes, you could like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as you said, you can
teach a robot Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> And again, you know,
speak back in Japanese, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but that's because that's
a Royal right there. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It has the one to standing
all the actual language. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I feel in, you can only
get so far learning a language </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> without knowing the culture. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and I'm only like
counterpoint to that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> It's like, well, on the
other hand, it's like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> English is constantly changing
as is, as are most languages. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like you go back 80 years
and you watch Japanese, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> you already don't understand
the Japanese that well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Same thing, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> language is a constantly changing thing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But language is like culture
as a whole, but in some ways, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> culture is a reflection of the language </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that changes over time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's exactly my point, where it's been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like such a weird journey
for me learning Japanese </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and just having, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like having like a
different part of my mind unlocked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's it's so it's so weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To charge 1% of his brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so weird to try to
describe this to someone who has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> never tried to learn a language or has, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or only knows one language. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You kind of like, even, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you could kind of even like
think differently with a second </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> language or like, you know, it's a. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - People have told me,
people have told me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I sound different when I speak Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I become a totally
different person, but I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would argue that that's
because the Japanese side of me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that speaking Japanese follows
more of the Japanese cultural </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> way of life, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> which is completely different
to the Australian way of life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is there any like Japanese
concepts in language that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think I like have combi translated
all like are difficult to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> translate? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, absolutely. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Absolutely. I mean like, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, you know, it's, I
don't think it's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> it's not just like one phrase
that can't be translated or </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> whatever. I mean, there's lots of, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> I would argue that there's a
lot of English words that can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be translated to joy.
That's definitely, but yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Like Boston, for instance. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Right. Oh, you know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> there's a lot of Japanese woods
that take an entire sentence </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to describe in English. Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But like, you know, there are
some like, especially like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, I think the whole thing of like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> just Kanji especially is
so difficult to translate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> without fully first explaining
what the Kanji even is. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And that's why I always found
it interesting that there are </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so many like Japanese, like, you know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> manga anime and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that so heavily rely on the
Japanese language and therefore </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the Japanese culture that
have somehow been translated </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and have somehow still
been understood by people </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> who have no knowledge of
the language or the culture. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like it still baffles my mind, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> how popular the "Monogatari"
series is outside of Japan, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because that show I've seen the subtitles. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> A lot of it gets lost in
translation so hard. Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> But somehow people still enjoy it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ideas are still there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe. I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But I feel that like, you know, it's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's interesting to see like
how a Japanese person would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> react to a show like that
versus how a non-Japanese person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> will react to a show, both
good, both positive outcome, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but a completely different
level of understanding of what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> makes it good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and like the language
also tells the history </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of the country. Well,
you know, like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we have a lot of French words
in English from when France </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had control over England, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but Japanese has tons of
English words and you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it also Japanese have a lot of
words that are like very cute </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> sounding to reflect the nature </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of Japanese society right now. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It all, it all kind of reflects
it in a way that's really </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting and kind of bizarre, really. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't really make much sense of yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause because I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I realized when I went back
to England and I was speaking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, speaking Thai
against my mum there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they were just like some tie
concepts and tie like words </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I just didn't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> couldn't be translated into English, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into my thought about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> There's this concept of entire called Jai </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which means the heart's right, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and a lot of things, a
lot of things revolve </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> around this concept of Jai. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So basically lawn means hot heart. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So that means you're in patients. Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And that's, that's the
literal translation, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Gin means patients cold hearts right now. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> There's this word called Lam lungi, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which means water flowing from the heart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you explain that to English. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Like what the does that water, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> water flow from the heart disease? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like it's drinkable water flowing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the heart means it's
someone giving genuine acts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of kindness with no strings attached. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They just wanna be welcoming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And they are willing to give
just these genuine acts of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kindness so that everyone
around them has a good time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and is more welcomed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they do that with no strings
attached. And like, there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there is no English
translation for that. Like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause the closest thing you could say is-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - 90 words to explain it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly, the
closest thing you can say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like kinds, but it's
not, it's not really kind, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like, unless you know, Tai, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean not unless, you know, Tai, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like if you've been to Thailand, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can feel this feeling, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This feeling that exudes from
the country, which is why, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which w which is why it's a
great place to go on holiday. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause everyone they're so
welcoming because a lot of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there have non PII and like, it's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so hard to explain that
into a different language </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because in Thai, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that is just a concept that
you feel because it's just so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> steeped in the culture and
you feel it when you go there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But if you don't speak the language, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> then you don't have a proper
word to place on this feeling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you feel, people exuding, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> same thing with Japan as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You feel a certain feeling
from, you know, that, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> someone who grew up in Japan
may have a different way of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thinking and a different way
of acting than say someone who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> grew up outside of Japan. And there's, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's so many like nuances
with just culture and just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> psychology that is so like
steeped into language that it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's, you can explain it,
but from what I've, from, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what I've from, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what I've experienced is the
difference between explaining a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> joke and understanding
a joke. You know, now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> now that I've been an avid anime
watch of my entire life and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I've had Japanese concepts
explained to me it's like been so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> weird actually feeling some of
these concepts as opposed to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> just understanding them. And I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, like one concept I
can think of in Japanese, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like this idea of reading
the room or reading the-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So kooky for like air in Japanese. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But like, and you know, we say
like, when we read the room, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> we say cook you'll you'll
know which means to read the, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> read the air, but like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's not quite the same as
when you say reading the app or </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> reading the room in English,
there's like a whole other, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like, it's, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's like a socio psychological
element that it's like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's so important to read the
room and not reading the room </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or not reading the air in
Japanese culture is so like not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> good. Like that's like, you're
basically just, you know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> societaly just, it's, it's
a societal death basically. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like a communication
within Japanese society that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> doesn't require. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It's, it's a thing that
doesn't require was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like non-spoken social
etiquette of sorts that Japanese </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> people have just hardwired into
the brain from a young age, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it's just so
integrated and it's a society. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And you know, again, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's like another concept
where you can explain it in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> another language and I'm sure, you know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you like looked into it and
understood it, then you know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you can be like, all right,
I get what that means. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You know, I can, I know how
to say it in this context, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but you know, even for me, it's like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't think I could fully use
or utilize the word or fully </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> understand what that word means, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because I personally didn't
grow up as heavily in an </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> environment like that.
Like I grew up with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Sure. But I wasn't born
and raised in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's like, there's that
sort of disconnect of yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> As you said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like understanding it from
an explanation and just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> understanding it through
osmosis and like yeah. It's. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's a lot of
things I've never thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> about in English as well, then maybe, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe it's just like purely
unique to our culture and our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> language. And it's just like, I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was, it's just been,
it's just been really weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's it's made me think about
things I've always took for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> granted in my life where like
language was just me conveying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> an idea. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I just didn't realize
that me speaking English meant </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that I was learning a part of
the history that our country </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> has been through. You
know, that's just, it's, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> it runs way deeper than
I gave it. Any credit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Men discovers language. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I can see why people
get into like linguists. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't get it either at first, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like, literally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just talking about linguistics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - The longest time I'm like, wait, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so what are you studying linguistics. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That. I'm like, do
you know how to speak? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What'd you need to know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - One more. Is that a learn about it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> But now I understand I'm like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> it runs so much deeper than
just, I know a lot of woods, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It makes me in some
ways, cause I, you know, I'm, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm floating whilst obviously
I lived there all my young </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> adult life, I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh yeah. No child life before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know, in some ways I'm like, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I'm I'm I know the culture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Of course I know the culture
and I'm like, wait, wait, wait, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what exactly is it again? I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like sometimes I think, oh man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> it's kind of hard to define it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's kind of hard to explain
anything in some ways I'm just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> like, yeah, it's like the UK,
but like way more friendly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that kind of, it just the
culture like first similar, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> but friendly I guess. And, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and more focused on being
expressive. It's not until. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You look at it through like a. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Third person perspective. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like sometimes dare say it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> it's almost easier to, to, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to look at a culture and its
totality when you're not a part </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of it. Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> Because you can kind of like
disconnect yourself from it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes whilst I'm like
something like explain most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cultures to me, I'm like, ah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. That's, what's so hot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, is it actually part
of that country's culture? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or is it, what is it just your experience? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think through that
culture. Right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's what I, I don't, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and obviously something my
experience different to someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> else. And so there would be cultural. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Would it be easier to
describe Welsh culture? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If the other person
spoke Welsh, you think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It would probably be a good way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to kind of hash things out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> I be like, think about this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> This is what you say. This is, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> it's one of those things
where it's like, I, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> getting a cultural, you know, hearing, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> if I explain Welsh culture to you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it could be totally different
to how someone else. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel we've experienced that
quite a few times on this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> podcast where we'd say
something, oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> All Australians like this, and then-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Every type person is just
happy to like be recognized. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's just like, okay,
I'm not gonna call me out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. There's no enough
profitable to even the, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> that like don't even
watch so much trouble, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> but don't a lot of them don't speak. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But it's always been
fascinating whenever I've like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> experienced my perspective
of like Australian cultural, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there've been people on
the other side watching our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> show, being like, no, that's this year. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it kind of opens my
eyes being like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> maybe it is just me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you get accused of
being a fake Australian? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I think we spoke about this before. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes I've been accused so
many times fake Walsh online </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that I, why does he sound English then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> What have an English accent?
How does that happen? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think at one time, in an episode, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I said that all Australians
own passports and a bunch of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Australians will like,
But all of my friends did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you also have a lot of international
friends as well. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just different crowd. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> So then that's when I realized
I'm like, oh, it's not. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually just integrate
it as hopefully as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The higher income, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the more likely you are to
having a passport because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously it's a luxury to travel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. And I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> my view of England is a very
skewed from a lot of people's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> view because I've only really
grown up in the south. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - From like the south, it's
like the rich Poppy's okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> For the ball. That does well for itself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> North is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I mean, I, I mean back, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it took me like until like 24, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 25 before I even went
beyond London, basically. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is like all the UK though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't go above London. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I know that. It's like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I've done well suited
to fields and Schiller. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the Midlands was just
this urban legend that people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> would make up. Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like Midlands
doesn't exist. It's just, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's all the north. It's all the north. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - It just sounds like a Lord of the rings. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - You call it the north in, in Australia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you have like the north section? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, we have, we have the coast and not. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - The, this is a great debate in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where does the north begin? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because there's unfortunately,
there's no big ice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Walls. People in the Midlands,
people in the Midlands, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Midlands wall, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> people in the Midlands where
they live in the middle, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they don't wanna be in the
north because the north has bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> connotations Pura, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So a lot of people will
debate where the north is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I believe there was a
census of where the north is and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not a line. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> It's this weird diagonal
line that goes from like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't remember where
it's, it's a very weirdly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> almost vertical line. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's closer to being
vertical than is horizontal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I remember correctly, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It could be like 45 degrees.
It just goes like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why we went. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some people say you're not
from the north from Wales. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But, well she's well she's north about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you've got a Wells, it's the door, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you haven't been to that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You would know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Isn't the latitude
wise. It's like the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as most of the Midlands? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Looks like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like almost same where
I'm from is almost the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> latitude as Liverpool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that kind of area.
That seems pretty north. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I think I would say it's
from my understanding. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Of where Liverpool
is in my map, it seems. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty good. It's pretty up there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. To me
it's like Birmingham is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you could maybe argue
as north, but bubbling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's pretty Northern as
well. I'd say, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've met more people from
Birmingham that would claim that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Birmingham is not from the north. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> No, we're from the Midlands Midlands. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's an old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Man. I think we're Austin, Australia. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To kill the saying that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think for us in
Australia, it's more so about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause the Mo the majority of
the population lives on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> coast line. So for us, the
argument has always been, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where does the coast, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like the coastal cities stop
and starts becoming the inland </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> cities and like, no, one's
been able to figure it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Because like, I think
for people on the coast, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> the coast seems a lot more
narrow than it actually is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I read something ages ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There was something
like in most countries, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> like if you don't artificially
create a border like Eastern </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> west Germany, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it'll almost always become
like a north south divide. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> Rarely becomes a, and even
if it's not geographically, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a north and south divide, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's called the north
south divide will weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why I put
this. Bring more to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I just didn't read the rest of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think about a lot of countries
with divides of like, well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like Germany has a north
south divide with like Bavaria </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> being a rich pop Germany in the south of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Italy is like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That as well. Has it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> France is like that too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> A lot of countries are
like that, North America, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> most European countries. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like that. I don't think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - America is like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's like the south Southern states. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was thinking about
America seeing east. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - And west coast. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like everywhere divided. Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Everyone's killing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Americans, like a quad dog. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess kind of a little bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Japan is like Tokyo,
Kyoto and everywhere else. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, a weird place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Japan actually is east and west. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it's not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And combo. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then also I would argue
in some ways it's north of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> south, because that's the
whole, a whole like Hertz, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> electrical grids being different. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's but it's like cut
off from like totally Tokyo. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like a 45 degree angle. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tokyo upwards. And then to
the east of it, but it's up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's doing like this way. It's going up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's a kind of south kind
of goes to the south. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Also, how did that happen? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's something to do with one
side of Japan wanting to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> European way and the other,
just wanting to do its own way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And for some reason, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno why Japan still
has the whole 5,060 heads, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> which by the way, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're filming stuff is
really inconvenient because you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to change. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You have to remember to change
your camera from 50 to 60 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Hertz. Otherwise, when we go
to a place and we'll record, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> there'll be, the
flickering will be insane. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like I filmed a crane game in Sendai, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but I think that's also on 50. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But then I think we filmed
something when we went to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Hiroshima, which is 60. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I think one of us, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we got to change one of the
GoPros and the GoPros is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just unusable because it
was just like strobe. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like, how does
this happen in such a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but in other ways, I'm like, this is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of course this happened to
Japan because I mentioned the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bank system. Of course
something stupid, like phase. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Out the floppy disks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> Oh God. Once something is decided here, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just the way it's gonna be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> There is no turning back. There is no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's all, that's all weekly
complain about Japan bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Welcome. You're welcome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Complained about America with complainant. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Even talked about anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> The bingo card is full. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. I, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I love talking about
the differences between </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> countries so much, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it also becomes like
a tedious to a lot of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> listeners. Maybe. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know. I just, I just, I just, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I definitely think that growing
up cause I've traveled a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> bunch and I was very, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> very fortunate that I've traveled a bunch. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I definitely learned a lot
about other countries. My, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> my dad lived in Germany mostly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it was really cool getting
to learn about all these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different cultures,
obsessed with U us culture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But sometimes it's really
hard to talk about it online </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because sometimes someone
living in that culture was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> no, yeah, you're wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I also wanna give it a
little talk about it to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> educated, but I would argue
that that's on that person. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. Because it's like,
well, yeah, obviously, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I say something very
skewed perspective, it also, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> if I say something
blatantly wrong, then yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean like France is a
good country. You know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like if I say that, then
that's fair enough that I'm, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, I'm joking, I'm joking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm British. We make the joke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can move to the UK. Go for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. No, but like, I feel
like especially now that now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> now that living in another country, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like probably living in another
country and integrating into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> its society. I mean, this is the first, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> this is my first real experience
trying to integrate into a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> society where I have not grown up in. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I have no prior experience in. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just been a shot in the dark. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I give you guys props for
that. It is, it is a learning. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's hard because he was
different from me living in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Thailand because I'm just
like, yeah, I've never, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've never properly
lived in Thailand before, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it's got like family, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> their family that I've
visited there. Enough. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I speak the language. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I understand the culture
as we've just said. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's it's, it was much
easier for me to integrate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And there wasn't as many surprises. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wouldn't say I got like a
culture shock per se. I dunno. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What is culture shock? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Culture shock is when
you go to a country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you realize that
something that you didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> think is normal is normal in Wisconsin, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> or like the daily norms that you did, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> our normal normal rethink
the way you think. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess maybe we've had culture shock, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but not like the UK reverse
culture shock. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I had more question to you, boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you find yourself more
critical of your home country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> after leaving south country? Yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really easy for me to
look at the UK and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what a mess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I knew it was a mess. I lived there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> but it was your mess. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It still is my mess. I still love it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I still love the UK, but
holy, what the are we doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now in the UK? There's this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There's this, this is
like no truck drivers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like no two people talking
about the fuel crisis. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> They it's not that it's that
we have no truck drivers </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because we stopped letting
immigrants into drive trucks. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> And so then it turned out
that we were only hiring </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> immigrants to drive tracks before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then suddenly they were like, ah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who's gonna drive the trucks.
And so now there's no, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's no truck drivers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And all of a sudden now
they're like, we should've, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we should've thought about this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sorry. Then I'm not
commenting on all that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause it's a minefield. But
there was this, there was this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Now there was this there's
this news thing on BBC. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So because there's no truck
drivers, what they've done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh, I dunno if this is just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this could have been just
news bait or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know what it was, but
this clip was just so funny. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't care if it's true or not. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There was this BBC a bit about
how now they were recruiting </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> prisoners who had truck
licenses to drive trucks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> But then they, that like,
they're like meet Steve. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> This is Steve. He's a,
he's a truck driver. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was in bed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Steve C was arrested for
smuggling cocaine on a truck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> into the UK. It's could they
not have, like, I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get it. I do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> He's a great truck. I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this man is really good
at driving. I was like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, that's trying
to sell the public on this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that is the one example
they give I'm like, come on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> People are not gonna be
happy with that. People like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people don't wanna Pablo
Escobar managing that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> infrastructure. You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like Steve, he ran over
70 people with a truck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> The problem was that
it was delivered food. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That is people being like
immigrant truck drivers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> man. It's like, it's
like, you can't make this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like they wouldn't bother a
guy who like broke the law, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> then get them, get someone
who can't speak English. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's up. And I know that's
this whole politics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't, I don't give a. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But that, that, that whole
thing is just absurd. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it was just that the humor
of it was just the reason why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> faddish so funny. She said we
should deliver through that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Traditional BBC, no opinion, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> no emotion vibe where it
was just like the British </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> government has resorted to
hiring inmates to try and trucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is Steve. He was caught
smuggling cocaine on a truck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just like, this is so
not even a single emotion, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this thing. And it was just so jarring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And Chris sent me the clarity.
It was just terrifying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, this is so funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just all my God. What is going on? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The absolute state, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the state of truck drivers
in the UK stay in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my Lord. BBC went downhill
since can't let that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's that's. I
mean, that's why I left. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. I got off all those stories. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - They reported that the best, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> most funniest way they could have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was very happy with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sometimes it's just the
way they like BBC news. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> It's just sometimes the way
they present it. So how can, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what's the word? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - The cold months, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> gold standards of not inserting
opinion in terms of at least </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just the, the broadcast airing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And like when they factually presented, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they have a lot of articles
that are absolute with full </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> opinions of garbage. But yeah,
generally the prime time TV, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they're just saying the
thing, normally it's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's good. It's a good example
of how it is then normally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> recently, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the got the BBC was
a kind of a gold standard and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> television and it was, and that's kind. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - It. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's gone down hill when they reported </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that a Gundam as a
transformer, I was like, that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was the final. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Salvo was the final straw. Couldn't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even make the research to
call it a Gunda. I put the. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Letter of resignation on the table. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know how like actors send
letters to other actors that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like your performance was amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a God sent the letters to the BBC. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I am disappointed the. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Absolute state of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This new state. What has
happened to the great to BBC. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna strike this from
my CV. So nobody ever knows. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I worked for the BBC. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Nobody ever will. The money I
would like to boycott the BBC. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I would like to rescind my
employment at the BBC, please. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just, oh God, cause
you already, you, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're living there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> you get to experience the nice
parts and, and the fun parts. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And now I only just hear about
the mess that's going on with </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> the news articles and stopped
my parents being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> so the world is on fire here, you know? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And they were like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> energy prices went up
like 1000% or something. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> They were like, the energy
bill went from like 40 pounds. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So like 500 pounds. And I'm
like, what the is going on? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> And Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I mean, like, even
like deep during the pandemic, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> when I heard about the 5g
things, because I'm so bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember back back when it
started, we were just like, ah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> look at, look at all the silly Americans. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - British people in the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Legitimately think that
crazy people only existed in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> They, they don't believe that
crazy places just in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - So crazy people exist everywhere. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've been all these news
articles about people like Bernie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> 5g towers in the UK came out
and the rest of the world would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, yo, get your, man's get your man's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll just like, say my man's
man, A Japanese citizen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's really bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like all the videos online
of 5g towers being torn down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like sat on fire. Every time
I was watching, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, what was his Florida or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And then you hear a broody
thick British accent. Like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh God, that's pretty bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno if we were just blind
to this when we were living </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> there, but I've always
just been exacerbated when. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's about five years, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's gone lifeline it's
skyrocketed. And yeah, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> it's really pretty tragic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like, especially during
like these past few years, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we've seen like the
stupidest parts of humanity, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just like on all like on front and center. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They don't think they think stupid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's unfortunate that, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> our country was like
part of that stupidity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> We thought every country
thinks there and mean to it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but we felt we soon find out that we are, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we are not in the justice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Any, any country with internet, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's gonna happen to every single, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> every country that has the
internet. It's unfortunate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Joe, do you know what I realized? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Ah, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like every cheesy hero movie
or every like cheesy heroic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> moment where the hero asks
the entire world to come </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> together, cooperate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like you remember that scene
in dragon ball Z where Goku </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> asks everyone to give me your energy, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> energy for the Spiro BombBomb. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I realized that's the entirely. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like imagine if that tried
to even imagine if that like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> happened in real life, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the Americans would argue
whether they have the right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> to not put that hands up. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan would take six months
to approve any of their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> citizens. Putting that
hands up the UK was started, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would start burning 5g towers
and Australia would probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go back into lockdown. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ground. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No one would put their hands up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh my God. I would like,
I would like to see that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would like to see that Goku
seen post COVID let's let's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> let's see how that turns out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I think it would go on for
twice as many episodes. Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just like, there's
just like the bad guys. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Go, go cross to go on a
PR trip around the world, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> kissing babies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Convince everyone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Smoke weed on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So what you're saying is Goku. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He said everybody has to
put their hands up. Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Really. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - People be like, I dunno, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Wing thing to say, I don't
know about this margin. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Bukari so you say he's the
greatest threat in the universe? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How come I haven't heard of him? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Sounds like a hoax to me
turning the frog's game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I haven't got any proof that he's exists, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but he's not some liberal, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> some something made up by the liberals. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> It's liberal propaganda.
I tell you, oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - So when someone needs to
make a political satire, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dragon ball Z, that'd be the
funniest thing in the world. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> New grounds. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> You need to come into the
dark ages and to make that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sucks just being like, I don't give </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about any of this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It sucks being like, yo, you're all crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What are you guys doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just be normal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so hard to be normal
because that in itself is a take. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't have strong opinions
on this weird that I read </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> online. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't care, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just trying to chill, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I just think that like, why
don't you be nice to people? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Know. It must be nice to have
the privilege to just chill. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But yeah, at the end
of the day, I, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I it's one of those things
where I it's unfortunate because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't think inherently people, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think there are a small
amount of people that genuinely </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are like extremely hateful
in a sense. I don't think, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, it's why I hate
demonizing any side too much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't like just saying
one side is right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I think at the end
of the day, even though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as long as they're not
posting harmful stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which I'm solid, unfortunately they are, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they are posting harmful misinformation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It sucks because I don't think
that anyone is inherently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like evil or trying to spread hate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think they genuinely just
believe that what they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spreading is gonna save
people's lives will help. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which sucks. Because then, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> then when someone believes
that firmly about it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is impossible to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I th I think it's just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's been exacerbated by
the internet. I mean, it's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like being in social media. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so easy just to fall
in an echo chamber, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where you were, because
you think a certain way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's nothing you get
exposed to that challenges you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> or challenges the way
you're thinking. Right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Because you know, in the
old days you hear something, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you hear something that you
disagree with and maybe you have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a, maybe have a debate
or, you know, maybe you, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you talk to someone about it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but in here you can just simply mute them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Or you can just simply not
follow people who have that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> opinion. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think that's the problem
I have with it. It's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't really mind people
giving like extreme opinions </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> about things on the internet. Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And, you know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> believing in something that
they firmly believe in. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> The problem I have is that no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one's having a open
conversation about it. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And no one is no one is
ready to be like, say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> say the opposite opinion
to me, I'm listening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And I will, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> and I will try and understand
that the best I can, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just like, blah, blah, blah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm right. you mute. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> You know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, it's, it's the incident. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's very powerful because I
think growing up anything you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> read it's in a it's in
books. It must be true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> You've been told that stuff
you read or stuff that you've </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> experienced. So stuff that
you're told is always true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. So and even then
it's not sometimes, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> Like I remember when I was like 12, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I first came across like the
moon landing. Conspiracy. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And like, for like a week, I've
already thought it was true. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah. Because I, I read
it and I thought, well, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that makes sense. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> This posting explained it
well enough to me. And then, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, but I was 12, I
was 13 or whatever, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, you're, you're a idiot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> You can't think about staff. You can't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. You can't be like, oh,
maybe they cherry picture. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like they presented information. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This all seems like it
makes sense in my world. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that I understand. So
it it's, it's, it's tough. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And some people, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like almost kind of
have that mindset going forward </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and never really liked, tend to think, oh, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> maybe I should look at other stuff. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What was that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've never written by the
losers or something like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> because it's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> it takes energy and time
to look at the other side. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And a lot of people don't have
the energy and time to look </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> at the other side nowadays. And. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like, train
yourself to like, kind of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You have to go against your, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your own gut feeling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you're just like, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have to literally go out of
my comfort zone and see what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the other side is saying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> which is why I like on
my social media. I try, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even if I don't, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even if there's someone out
there who I don't agree with, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I still like sometimes
follow them or I still like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> sometimes want them to
appear on my feet. Just so, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just so like, I know
what the other side is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I do hate this idea that you
can't follow anyone who has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like controversial takes or
anything on Twitter. I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was so war it's like, you
know, you're not promoting them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you're following them,
it's like, all right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> well just let them follow them.
Like, what harm is it doing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why would you want an echo chamber? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't understand this whole
process of only experiencing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your thought process and people
who think similarly to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I, to me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Surrounded by nothing. But yes, man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that equally turns you into. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because someone has
committed like war, war crimes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or genocide. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> Maybe it's a little different. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> But if someone just said
something that's but yikes on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Twitter, it's like, I mean, if
someone just gave an opinion, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's tough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I got canceled for that or
canceled. I remember they like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> he's following he's Ben
Shapiro or something. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> He's he's right. Waiting bro. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> Or Jordan pizza or
whatever. Like that kind of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think that's like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like the next
level of just like, oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you it's not even, you agree
with this person it's you are, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have a platform where you
listen to this person, the by, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by therefore you aren't
supporting them. I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just wanna know what
the other side is saying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I think it's interesting to see, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to have a different perspective, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if I don't necessarily agree with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, I think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think a big reason why I
just like don't have the energy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like a lot of politics
nowadays or like this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this spectrum of a mentality
is that everyone has something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to say, but everyone knows
what they stand against, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but no one knows what they stand for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's how I feel, where
you can like a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's so many people who
say, you can say, this is bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I disagree with this. I disagree
with this person and this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I disagree with that person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they've never told me
what they stand for or what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> you know, what, what their
fight, you know, what, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what opinions are standing
for. And I'm just like, well, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know what? You can,
you can discredit someone, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but you can't come up with an
argument force your own values </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or your own views. And I
think, I think that's why I, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's why, like, I don't have
the energy for this anymore. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> That's why, that's why I've
started to just, you know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I've I've I just listened to people. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I like listening to people
when I feel like even listening </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to the other side of the
argument really broadens your </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> horizons. Even if it's
something you don't agree with, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or even if you think the
other side is stupid, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> which you know, kind of
happen, certainly do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It does keep you grounded. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> And it does help form your volt
form your worldview as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_04> They're not overly opinionated, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but they're also very eloquent. These, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> these people would put
the hands up for Goku. </SPEAKER_07>
