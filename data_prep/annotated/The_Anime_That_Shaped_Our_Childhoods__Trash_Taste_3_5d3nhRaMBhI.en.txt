<SPEAKER_04> professional </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> no no exactly right Wow okay ruining my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> turn what I would like to discuss today </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> with you gentlemen is your anime origin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> story if you will how did you get into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> anime and how you know you discovered </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that you were going to go down this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> rabbit hole of never coming this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> beautiful medium that we all we all love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I mean you wanna go first Joey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because I feel like you have the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah most likely yeah probably I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> probably have all yeah yeah okay I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> having to follow up his story is gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> be fun but I mean yeah I guess like mine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is unique in the sense that like and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would you say I'm the only Ana tuber </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that has like grown up with anime like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and when I say grown up I mean like from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like Age of like conceptual thought age </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of conceptual thoughts I think just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being raised in a household to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japanese perón yeah probably has an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately different attitude towards </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> anime them that we would experience in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like Western right because like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when most people say like oh I grew up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with energy that was my childhood like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know that usually starts away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> age late you know well yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the real question is did you know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime was growing up I mean that's all I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> ever yeah exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay so so when you were you growing up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in your head even at like age five or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> six there's a clear distinction between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Pokemon and like I don't know we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want the Cartoon Network shows that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a difference and you knew that they one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of them as Japanese yeah yeah yes like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because unlike a lot of kids in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Australia and like probably around my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> age group I grew up watching Pokemon and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like Dragonball Japanese I thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Pokemon was an American cartoon people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> did my mind was blown at like age ten </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> when I heard the Japanese version this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is on YouTube clips right like oh wait </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the original yeah how because to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> me Pokemon when I was growing up just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> seemed like this very weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> genre like I couldn't put my finger on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but I felt like it was a genre like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it was pokemon digimon Cardcaptor Sakura </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> which was cardcaptors it in the UK in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> America Sakura that's true Asian sound </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> get rid of that Sakura Sakura </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> oh and the other girl was like they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> changed her name to Madison I think I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can trim all her original name was but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is this is back in the age of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> four kids dubbing I don't think it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even even for kids that dubbed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cardcaptor Sakura but it was in the day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's you know localization was a thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we are eating jelly doughnuts cuz you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know like being as you said like growing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> up in an Asian household Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> household what media was just like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> most like normal concepts like your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> breath it's like you know like yeah as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you said it's like bread it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching an American content like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Dexter's Laboratory yeah like a scene of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them making toast for example and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> over dubbed into Japanese like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm making a rice ball I think it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> cause at that time I remember a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> my friends just didn't really know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> concept of just eating rice yeah if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want if you want Asian you're like why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> would you eat rice with every meal that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't make sense </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> great right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I can remember what my family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> thinking like rice was like exotic isn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really well I mean it was something you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> had with like foreign food yeah so you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't eat rice but like that's on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> contrary though right like do you eat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> bread with everything because at least </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in Japan the concept of white bread with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> everything is like why I feel like at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> least in British culture you could put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> bread with anything like you just wear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I guess I guess like the food I'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> drop that country revolve anyway we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting off topic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but so like basically like I grew </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up like watching Pokemon and like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> else can remember watching I guess like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before that though like before Pokemon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything like that or you know before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I started watching like one piece like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Dragonball like you was shown in jump </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff like Japanese kids grow up with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this like very certain array of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> kids anime yeah which is just absolutely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> not known overseas so Ryan was probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the most well known but like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't like see a Nana to bow a five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> thousand review Doraemon let's go series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that I grew up watching like alongside </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> thorium or was this show called </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> salvation yeah which is like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> longest-running just running and yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and nobody outside of Japan has heard of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you I didn't know about it until you I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was having perspective in my mom cause </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right so it's it's been going on since </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like the sixties and I think there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like five thousand how I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> please because like it's really weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because the concept of that show is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just a revolving around this family </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> living in Japan and it's just like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most like normal ask slice of life show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I've ever seen but I also think to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> myself like how can you come up with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like 40 years worth of topics and not be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh maybe we did cover this topic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 25 years ago and one of those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> episodes there must be absolute that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> overlap like I feel you can't make that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> many episodes or not overlap I know I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably could overlap but nobody </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> watching that show right it's one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> those things if it's on TV you watch it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right it's like they covered this topic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in episode 1700 there's you know there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> one super fan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> apologist in every episode and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> knows everything about every episode but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that seems to be and Doraemon seem to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the one thing where if you ask anyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> do you watch anime they'll be like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I thought I'm honest yeah and I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh I'm in like you know the other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime thing she's no boobs in that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> please don't but like but like watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Doraemon and like saws Ison and like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't list off a number but late </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's just like a certain number of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shows that I think like it's just become </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tradition now no matter what generation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or like if you're born born and raised </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the city or the you know the middle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of nowhere every kid grows up watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> these like really specific set of shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know and that's just like it normal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to them you know that's like watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know a Peppa Pig yeah it's like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just like you don't even think about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh yes it's a cartoon yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just something to show to you yeah right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then yeah like I guess like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> concept of like anime anime didn't hit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> me until maybe like oh I thought when I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> started watching like one piece I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Dragon Ball and like probably around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the Pokemon time so I reckon when I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was like five or six years and white </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> girl so so when you started realizing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what anime is it probably gets in into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it that's when probably we started to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watch our first anime which was Pokemon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right but like in my head I'm like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Pokemon is an anime and like Samurai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Jack is a cartoon yeah because at that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> time like around like five or six years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> old that's when I started like watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Cartoon Network and I'd like to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think that we grow up in like the Golden </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Age of causing Network I mean I'd say so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had Samurai Jack that's right jack </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like Dexter's Lab cow and chicken yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> anyway so many amazing shows and to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like okay things on Cartoon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Network are cartoons yeah but things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are on like the VHS tapes that my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> grandma would seem to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh those animes anime yeah so for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like a really clear distinction </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so like I didn't have like one day this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sudden realization there like oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Doraemon is an anime yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it was just so natural to me see I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even remember when I got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> realization because I think I must have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got it when I properly started getting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into anime with Naruto was my first like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> anime anime and that was purely because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just kept seeing avatars and you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gifts on the internet and I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah this kind of looks like Dragon Ball </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Z which I grew up I can't see now I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ready in - do they have ridiculously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spiky hair exactly right yeah I think I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was on the internet way before I started </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> watching anime and I think obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being on the Internet you see a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime I just think in all I knew is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> their opinion didn't matter because they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> had profile anime profile pictures it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> generational now it's generational </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean pokeman was the first one for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I must have been like God I mean Pope </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was always one of my favorite shows and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think we've mentioned this in like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> episode zero or something that it had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like an overarching story yeah but you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only really got you don't really get it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> actually in anything for like avatar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that came way later yeah like an old </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 90s do you just call avatar anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> oke like cartoon you know you don't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Courage the Cowardly Dog for the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> overarching story right like you watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> chicks it's like every episode it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> great and you have a good time but then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember poke one was like oh whoa </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like actually like working </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> towards something yes I think as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like that era of anime as well like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't like a lot of cartoons it was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yes there was like a Masonic moments but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as you said there was like an over they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> used you even if it was a filler you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> knew they were like they had a goal yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and that seemed to be the case </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where that kind of structure really like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> spoke to me as a first for whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> reason I really enjoyed that as a kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then yeah you had the same thing and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> then I thought how all these things with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> all the spiky had people there really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like wild drawn things are like I like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> these kind of it's so easy for me at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> least with you you know is that I didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know you yo wasn't anime because I grew </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up with the card game first time I got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the card game and then watch them yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right because one of your schools </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> playing Yuki yeah I didn't get that face </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't get that yugioh phase we had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> ivory because when I was in school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone was like trading pokemon cards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and nobody knew how to play the actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> game we are like a black market like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> trade deal with photon cards I have like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I had like a really dog like you your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> face just like I was like I was legit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like [ __ ] it's like dad because my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dad like used to work for like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> printing company yeah what he would do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is he would find like high-res like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> print them out and I would come to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> school now if you like my piece of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> exodia and I mean like 10 year old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't know but it was funny as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because like much like your Pokemon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause you no one knew how to play you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you it was just like oh cool you have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Exodia because I feel like like the rows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of you go were easier to understand oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> come on yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> oh comes hard yeah cuz I did like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't think anyone in my school played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the Pokemon card games you collect them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you just you just collected them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah like it was easy understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you had a shiny um well that's the thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> though right it's like in order to play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the Pokemon card games you need it to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like not throw away the energy cards </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> which like my my school like in my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> school everyone was just like yep go up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go up go I haven't got lunchtime every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> day am I sure yeah but yeah I guess I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> started to realize that I really liked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime when everyone got into Pokemon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when we had the pokemon card card game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> phase as well so yeah just like a global </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> craze </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah how long did that last that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> lasted like a year or something right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well I think or like a few months the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> year I was born 1986 I think poke Holmes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the most googled thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah of that year a game it just it just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> came out and obviously since that point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> onwards it's pretty it through the mid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 2000s yeah pretty insane I hope one was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like and arguably still today is one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the biggest like yeah cuz I just kept </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> watching Pokemon even after everyone had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like even when the cursor and ever my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mom was my mom without wondering like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> why is this kid still into Pokemon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] he's going on oh I had the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing my parents were like they were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like worried for me they were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> should we like doing he's like do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something about this like he's still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like watching cartoons my older brother </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> had like foregone cartoons yeah there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a sign of pride that he's not watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> games like I only watch reality TV show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> now with my parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't watch this kids i watch a game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> TV yeah right right yeah yeah and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] loved like you know Samurai Jack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like I would always try and watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Samurai Jack like scars Cowardly Dog </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime as well my parents genuinely like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what concern for me I don't know if they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> still are concerns the exact point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because all the way up to university and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when I rediscovered what anime was my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> parents were like he's doing it again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> pass this [ __ ] phase when they found </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> out I was watching like more anime than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they were like more concerned they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like whoa he's gone even harder and yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought it would stop I remember my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> dad like the funniest thing my dad ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> said I think I was in like late maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the last year of high school yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was like when I was like hot this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right before I made my youtube job and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was like watching every anime ever my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> dad would be like what are you doing in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your room because he thought I was doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something else yeah I know when I told </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> him that I was watching anime I remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> my dad saying like okay at this point I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think I'd rather you just do drugs I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would have been less disappointed if I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> found that you were doing drugs which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> ones more life crushing yeah but like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know like I guess like I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really have like a phase of like when I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dispute anime or anything because as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> long as I've known why do yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like even mangas well like I started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> reading manga like around the same time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I discovered or I'm oh we just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably around when I was like four or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> five years old howtechs you've been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reading manga since four or five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> probably maybe earlier than that but I'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> specifically remember the first ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> volume of manga ever God was volume 2 of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Doraemon I don't know why my mom didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get me volume 1 cool like I didn't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it was like the overarching story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I was like oh just start reading this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I had no idea what the [ __ ] was going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's all I don't fully 100 now it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> makes it's like a wow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mani I feel like my anime thing was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's three points in my life where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like I was I conveyed like very vividly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember watching anime first was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Pokemon yeah they are occasionally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seeing a yugioh episode of the cards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I think maybe when I got access to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like the Internet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's when another one came </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I remember watching like yugioh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it was GX right parts three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> parts three parts on YouTube you know it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sounds like an OG anime fan because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like oh yeah don't you hate it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you find an espagnol sub of your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your one okay so envision it right it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> two thousand right you watch episode 1 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> part 1 of Yuki oh yeah okay cool I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna watch episode 1 part 2 you click </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it it's the next recommended video it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in espanol thank you do you just do you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like keep looking or you just give up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and go to the next part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I remember so many times I had to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do that what was then that is when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like could someone uploads like a full </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> anime movie yeah always always like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> either like pot 6 or part [ __ ] one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> part that was missing yeah who didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> find us you just had to give up and just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> be like alright I'll just skip 15 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minutes I just hopefully try and catch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I think there's 15 minutes of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> first Naruto movie that I've just never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> seen it's just I don't know what's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happened it might be the best 15 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of Naruto the max upload time is 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> minutes on YouTube right yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why I was plugged into three yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and yeah I remember that was like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the biggest and the third part </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would always just be like five minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah there's the outro off of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah no that was like definitely a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> big phase for me and I could have been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around 13 14 at that point question to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you then did you grow up during the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Toonami phase because I feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> tsunami is has played such a big factor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> into making the anime fans of today no I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> hate for some reason I we did we have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Toonami in the UK we did we did but you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> need it you need it Sky TV so I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you needed Cartoon Network to be so sky </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like basically cable in the UK </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> wait you guys didn't get consonant with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just like free - no no they've got to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> network yes I'm here in Australia it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> free oh wow yes because I know my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> parents paid because my dad wanted to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pay for the football matches in the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and you basically got the whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bundle so I would watch the cartoons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff and I remember there's like there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was loads of cartoons I never saw anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was raring really late </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and by there my parents are like why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't you in bed son because when you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Joe was on the tsunami army it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Dragon Ball Z Gundam Wing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Iram the same Dragon Ball never watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it though cuz I just it was always a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mess because it would they add it out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> order so I was going on I thought it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cool but I couldn't get into it yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think Dragon Ball Z and Gundam Wing were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the only two I was able to watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever because our family didn't have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sky TV so I can only watch it when I go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to my cousin's house and I'll be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> watching episodes out of order Gundam </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Wing made no [ __ ] sense still makes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like I'll be watching a scene and for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some reason the guy wants to kill this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> girl but the girl still wants to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the guy makes no [ __ ] sense to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> me as a kid you know gunner he's already </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> confusing enough as it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Dragon Ball Z was okay because I could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just watch I could skip five episodes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and they'd be the same cuz I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like I would help you watching these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> scenes in Dragon Ball Z yeah and Goku </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like powering up the Spirit Bomb </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and then I'd go I I'd not be able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go to my cousin's till like two weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> later the Goku was still powering I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh this is just the next episode no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like I missed like three four </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> episodes and it was it was just four </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still the same [ __ ] to this day he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> still powering it up hasn't finished man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if he hasn't died for the seventh time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because my my exposure to anime has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got like now that I think back to it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's there's the main phases of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the Pokemon phase and then there's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Toonami phase yeah well I'd see it on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Toonami and TV and then there was this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> huge gap I have exact same yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then I did like I realized now that in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the in this huge gap I still had like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> small exposures to anime like whenever I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to Thailand we'd always have these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shitty shitty Thai dubs these are like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like Ultraman was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was like a massive in Thailand even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> though that's even though that's not an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> anime but like Dragon Ball Z dubs and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> man having listening to Thai doves </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they've only got five voice actors and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> actresses and they voice every character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in every anime who's growing up in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Southeast Asia </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> knows what I'm talking about when you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> have five voice actors who plays every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> character in every show and then my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cousin showed me I think was Princess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Mononoke just our hostess it came out I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't know it was animated just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was this animated film I thought it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Disney how old are you and you watch it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ah and he came out in 97 yes I must have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> been like like it was the year after </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> came out cuz there's a gruesome movie to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch I thought I thought that movie was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just Disney and then just just before I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> discovered like Naruto air that I went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through the LimeWire phase just for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> music though I didn't know no just just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for music same here right so I would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> browsing browsing LimeWire for music I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably you'd like downloading Linkin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Park or Papa Roach or something like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that and then something else likes you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know sometimes you download a file yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's not the file you aim for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's why you meet everything the Bill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Clinton fine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so in LimeWire someone was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> circulating bible black clips yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> never knew that Bible Black was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese anime because I'm just like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> an epiphany she was like this is the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> most amazing thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I can imagine though like because that I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> don't even remember I don't want to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on to the toffee boy I don't remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how I discovered people I killed the top </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> I yeah I blamed it on my brother and he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> totally got blamed for it but it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> totally me yes III think that I would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> have been I think the reason why and I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just realize this now I was wondering </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the [ __ ] was I doing between like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 13 and 18 yeah I can picked about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it and I just realized I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> cripplingly like addicted to Xbox like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like every second I got free I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was playing call of duty like that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like ah friends is well right Nash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like the like the Golden Age of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like playing games yeah play with your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> friends at school it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately when I was done I'd go home </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> play games until I had to go to bed and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like the Golden Age of a call it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as well oh my god that was perfect yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 1 phi2 came out when I was like like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 1516 and which is like by the perfect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> time to play it I I think I had an age </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like a gap as well that I didn't watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any my nose around the same time yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know exactly why I wasn't but I'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna say because it's probably yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> weirdly enough even though like during </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that gap until I probably the last year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> school hmm I was still reading manga </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like religiously yeah so I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what it is it's like I had this burnout </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with anime or maybe just like a loss of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interest with anime of some reason manga </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was like always this one thing that I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would just come home and just read the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] out of wait just a little more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> engaging almost like actively make an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> effort oh yeah and also because I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like reading in general I think so so I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean a lot of question to you guys what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> drew you to anime over like cartoons or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> other things like what drew you to this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> medium specifically as a child that's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> kid and growing up as well for me it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just the fact that my mom would just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> push it a lot because it was the she </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> knew that it was the easiest way for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to appreciate the Japanese culture yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every time I realized Joey's born on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese I'll speak Japanese god I like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like my mom knew that like if I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kept talking to her in Japanese yeah it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would most likely stick but she wanted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> me to like not just be like competent in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese really the whole cold chilly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah not just appreciate the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> culture but also like excel in Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah and like thank God </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because now I think I have yeah and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you know I have learned to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> appreciate the culture and just anime in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> general in the language and like I did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know learn a [ __ ] ton of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese even though I said well in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't use animate alone in Japanese yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I kind of helped open admit I learned a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of Japanese from watching out I mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> any amount of language that you take in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to learn like if you're watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> anything in a language it's good you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> know he'll help I feel like as a kid you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just absorb it through osmosis I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah like I remember learning Thai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just because I was what like whenever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd go to Thailand I would just I would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just absorb it whenever talking to my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> family or just watching TV shows did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> learn any Thai from the Thai Dobbs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> um letter account I can be hard and tie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the same it's just very bad quality it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of its kind of like I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> know there wasn't a lot of money put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> into the dubbing industry I reckon so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> store more that much - yeah so and we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> all we all know a second language then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> purely cuz we were just raised yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everywhere is spoken yeah yeah but the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing is well was when you were a kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you have way more time to just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sit there and absorb it when you're in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> handle it's uh I get ten minutes a day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on dueling or maybe right where's a kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like eight hours of just you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hearing this stuff so obviously you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna pick it up but I was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like from as far as I can remember with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my childhood like the only memories I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have is just like either watching anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reading manga or like watching come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right right right yeah so already just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from that like two-thirds of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> childhood essentially is MIA just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> absorbing the Japanese language in like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> anyway pause right so I think that just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> helped me a [ __ ] like if I never got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> into anime or manga I would like to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think that I would be nowhere near as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> good write the language as I am now I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think definitely for me when I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching anime the thing that appealed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to me especially my younger age is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I said oh yeah like there's more of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a structure right and there's always an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> overarching like point there's no me a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> journey to go on and also I felt like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know I mean this wasn't a problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back then went with our cartoons you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know the ones a we grew up with yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> felt like anime didn't treat the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> audience stupid you know like if you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're like 16 18 yeah you know maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't want to Pokemon you can still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> appreciate it and enjoy it and I felt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that like some cartoons I mean I mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you can watch Samurai Jack any age why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this time yeah there was a lot when I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was growing up there very treated you as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a kid right whereas Pokemon was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your teenager you're going on a journey </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I'm gonna catch pokemon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was so cool like imagine yourself as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that like it sounds dumb how old was Ash </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> again - 10 10 10 but I mean but I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here - [ __ ] together </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like you imagine a mom just letting a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> ten-year-old go I to the [ __ ] world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> by himself with a [ __ ] rats to keep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> him company </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean wasn't the whole joke there like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the mom sent her off so they just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> brought commits crimes are like yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guess that was really irresponsible of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> us so I go with a 35 year old man and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Misty okay with like ash hanging out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like this 10 year old kid life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> throws your bike into a river it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll pay you back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> how also as like a ten year old as do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you have any concept of Brock constantly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> hitting on people what do you how do you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like perceive that like like what is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that to you is it imagine being broke </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and just leaving your family and your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> job to like follow this massive family </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> as well what are you doing nice to say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that kind of reckless behavior really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> appeals to me as a kid just I'm leaving </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my family that I was supporting we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> leaving my family for what to follow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this tenure also I can go slay some post </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it's like strangely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reminiscent of like Hisoka from Hunter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hunter it's like grown man just wants to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> follow a kid around see him grow it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the biggest thing for me though with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> late Pokemon that just made no sense to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know is how Gary oak yeah is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> essentially the same ages ash and yet he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> can get like all this puss this is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bad that like I actually like liked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> carrying more than a hat and I loved it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when he was a dick to ash I'm like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you should be catching pokémon ash </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because he was actually achieving the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> goal to become a pokémon master </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like I feel like as a kid maybe you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> appreciate ash more but hasn't had like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know Gary's kind of got [ __ ] - yeah </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> that man did it all like and yet we </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> like I think when they were like when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Ash was about to like go to like Koga I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> think I know Gary just rocks up in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] like Lamborghini like you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> still here who's driving the car yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not only is he an expert Pokemon master </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> an Islam beginning he doesn't worry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about parking tickets I was just walking </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> shitty oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean yeah definitely as a kid that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> whole kind of structure and the kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know going on a journey I was very I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> will you guys like did you guys feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really like disappointed when ash got </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> this is our destiny like he formed these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> artificial bombs with these Pokemon and </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> anime twisted you bro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is actually uh there's actually this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> really funny thing I have found the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other day when I was learning to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Pokemon speedruns yeah yeah you know the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other thing called ash percent to play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the game exactly like every Pokemon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly the same oh my gosh you have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> release your Butterfree you have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> release your Charizard and then you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to purposely lose at the would drive me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> mentally 9 oh my god shirtless mario </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> speedrun yeah you do basically just your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> speed run mario ought to see where you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> try and get mario sure let's cruise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> possible yeah I love the troll speed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> runs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anyway we got off-topic okay and I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know well it was it the same thing as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> well for you as a kid yeah I like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know I couldn't quite put my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> finger on it but it was this huge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> overarching plot like they had a goal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were working towards a goal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like Pokemon turned out to me my like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as as I watch more anime I started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> liking Pokemon less and less like when I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things like Digimon came and they had an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actual like story arc my Charizard at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the most crucial moment did you want for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> me was probably the moment when I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually fell in love with anime yeah do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you want to know something I never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> watched the Digimon anime did you know I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> watched it the only things I anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Digimon that I ever like consumed are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the two movies I played the games as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well as a kid and the other thing I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> remember is them being hot as [ __ ] are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they are well there are games of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's games and like I think at least </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the Digimon World Games I don't know how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> old they are I remember like thee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like some of the hardest games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get like full completion any games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ever like they're like insane and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember as a kid thing like the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> why can't I get past the first level I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> beat all of Pokemon in French I what the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hell like yeah no I never I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what it is maybe because I was just so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> obsessed with Pokemon yeah but like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> always knew Digimon was a thing yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I never watched any of it was always the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> joke is a kid right you would like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] comedian if you yeah I guess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're the did you know no one wants to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> be the Digimon [ __ ] I have a question </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for you specifically okay this isn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> apply to you but did you like as a kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have a sense of like oh I kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this whole like Japanese culture thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever it propped up you know in like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> TV or anything I mean to me was less of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a less exotic cuz to me it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Asian culture I guess yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because it was it was I had seen more of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it because I you know I didn't exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> grow up in Thailand but I would visit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there at least once a year so I'd spend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like my summer holidays in Thailand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> every year so seeing some of more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese culture the more Asian oriented </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> culture it's not that different from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what you get from fly-ins Asia like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese specific like say onigiri I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't have no idea what the five before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I could see that all it was just a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> ball of rice I know Ric is I can see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what this is I guess it's a difference </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of me coming from you know the whitest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place on earth and not not being exposed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to any other especially Asian cultures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know yeah yeah the only Asian </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> exposure I had you know apart from media </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was just like the shitty Chinese shot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you know down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a dress like we've had awful Chinese and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I think whenever I saw Japanese stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in media I thought it's so cool like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's gonna sound so [ __ ] dumb that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were the same go on you know you're more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like jackass the movie or whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whether they wear like one of them goes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to Japan oh yeah sounds like just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stripping in a store and dancing yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the whole time I just didn't know what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that like dude look at those [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> appliances they have I thought it was so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cool they had all these appliances in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the store like I've never seen them like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because in the West we never got those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like TV and radio built in yes and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they had like the numbers on the side I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thought those were cool as [ __ ] as a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then obviously watching like samurai </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff and then Samurai Jack was a huge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing that made me think like I [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> love samurais oh yeah they were like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> coolest things to me I think I think it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was either like we're depending on if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you were into anime oh yeah like the two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> things that got people into samurai were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> either Samurai Jack all the locks I can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> still watch Samurai Jack today and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] love my Jack ride like a baby </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Samurai Jack is just a [ __ ] great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> show Jack was like the one constant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Network show other than ed and Eddy that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my dad would be just as excited to watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like dude like I remember like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the episode we'd like the assassin do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you remember this one would they like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that the robot dog and I love that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> episode all my favorites but uh I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my head looking back now I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it was inevitable that I was gonna get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> into anime cuz I had like a fondness for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese culture well it wasn't like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> intense a we be a thing I like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> movies I like the like all the culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I saw I loved video games and being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a video game fan you're gonna run into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like stuff so you're like huh why is it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this and you're like oh it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese yeah and then also watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anime from a young age and like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so I felt like it was inevitable at some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> point in my life I was gonna find anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like I [ __ ] love this [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> my I feel I completely forgot about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> video games and just like JRPGs oh it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a big push you don't realize not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really exactly I mean yeah and I realize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of the same story tropes that drew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me to anime like I liked in JRPGs and to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> JRPGs as well I guess remember the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when Japan just felt like this foreign </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah concept oh yeah yeah like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was where this is way past even when me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> discovering anime but I mean I remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like after discovering an amazed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> discovering Naruto and everything you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know it was so weird to find anyone who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went to Japan or see any kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese media even outside of the Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like it's only recently become a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> tourist destination yeah you know like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like if my my parents who like never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to leave Europe right like they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if it's not Europe it's not a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> vacation if they're considering like Oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> career and Japan sounds cool like if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't like that I'm like okay well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now I guess everyone's up to it now are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they thinking that yeah they were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> planning they're not just because I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lived here but they were gonna they one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the car anyway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and yeah I feel like there's that kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of mainstream nurse of it anyway as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really like had a big impact recently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cuz I remember when I first started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> watching stuff on YouTube there was no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like vloggers like I've been watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like a Chris broad video from like years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ago yeah and he was like the only guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right he was one of the oh geez right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the thing yeah and I remember back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> then like if you wanted to find certain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese they were had to be like a BBC </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> documentary yeah yeah someone going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there right yeah like it was not a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> youtube the weird wacky world of Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> ya know like you can find out anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you want about exactly like it's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> hard but I remember yeah like same thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you'd see you see these weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> commercials you'd see like these clips </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> from these talk shows or the variety </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and you're like what the [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> going on in this country takeshi's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Castle at 7:00 a.m. every day the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> challenge I used to wake up early before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> school and I would like watch every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> episode over like I literally watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> takeshi's castle all throughout high </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> school no no same in those reruns oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I loved it every time yes the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> episodes over and over it's like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like watching Top Gear and down you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's it's something you could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> always watch over and over and it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just so [ __ ] weird usually that I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> found out though that like takeshi's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Castle you guys had the console yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they're really interesting because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a shirt from the 80s yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's strange cuz I think America has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> their own version as well by the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> takeshi's Castle is this kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> physical the most extreme Game Show was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it called like did your warriors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something like that like what's like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> moment you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but imagine if it was like all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> contestants were just everyday people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was horribly unfair yeah it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so unfair and it was so fun and it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just brutal these these courses they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> would just send people and they were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ninja warrior' across the jackass yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] dangerous I mean there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> reason why they don't do that show any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no no no legit oh yeah yeah that show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> had a huge following in the UK because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of rally and and I think America did as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> well but each each localization had a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different style to it sir the Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> mom she just showed the show yeah a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> British one had like this Craig Charles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a Charles who's have quite a famous </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> person back in the 90s right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because he did Robot Wars right right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it was really big in America they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> had like a kind of imagine like a pseudo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of football commentators been like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what do you think of that Jeff yeah he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> supposed to be like kind of like jokey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thinks I should watch clips of it it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not as good but each country a Terran </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> localization yeah okay was huge because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember those petitions even when I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like 16 17 people wanting to bring </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it back but I mean how can you bring it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back by just dumping over the old but a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thailand actually had I think a version </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like a few years ago as well okay they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> made their own version I know because I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember watching and thinking like not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the same thing quite scratch but that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was a huge factor in why also I love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese culture because you watch that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> show in light it's it's crazy it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amazing and it's also a blatantly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> extremely Japanese yeah you're seeing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like katakana kanji everywhere like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously just like it's it's purely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> jazz like ADHD like editing you know I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> know it's pure like yeah that's my first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> introduction to like using Japanese your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chaos I don't know but what it is about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japanese variety shows it's just about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> having as much information on screen to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like distract your eyes as possible I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> start making YouTube videos I have come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to like feel sorry for every Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> editor oh the sheer amount of texts they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> have to put on the screen changing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> colors and [ __ ] popping up everywhere </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because everybody's dialogue has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes it's like we can hear them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fine do you know what I hate when I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever I see like an anime trailer and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's from like Japanese TV so they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always go like this guy reacting to a or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something oh in the corner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're not even reacting that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they just lame yeah yeah yeah game shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll have like yeah and really like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like normal thing others have a guy in </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> hexagon maze although I was really this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maze and like and you got a up top down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> view which is so good and you would see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them go through this maze and they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> basically these [ __ ] dudes which grab </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> them in the face there's also like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> rolling things that they know the one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the one of things that's my mind is the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one where they're like rock skipping </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like just like you you [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] go full pelt over these like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rocks over a river and some of the rocks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would just would just sink yeah I'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just imagine if like you're running full </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pelt and then one of the rocks sinks and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you just faceplant into a real rock oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> my god I'll live to painful if you </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> fun I don't think a show like that good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> command of issues causal they're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there's so many shows that either </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> America or the UK or like some Western </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> countries like off like silent library </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> as crazy as a [ __ ] No </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean ya know it's crazy I mean I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that was definitely game shows like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything kind of got me into anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Ryan like it was just that kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> buildup of I kind of think this culture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is kind of sick right and I like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they do I like all the media that they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put out like you know just jives with me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right now I just seem to enjoy it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then I remember the first like anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime right this is where we're talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> about like finally getting into like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there should yeah oh [ __ ] yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> remember I really force up for some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reason I wanted to be like a TV and film </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> snob I don't know why I wanted to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I've seen everything I think I feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like everyone's gone at this point yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everybody I feel like it was in it I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just finished watching like 24 in Prison </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Break and I was feeling like man I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> such TV connoisseur I've watched Prison </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Break in 24 so I went to went through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the list and and Death Note was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eight for something at the time Wow nice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I this must've been like mm yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 1213 yeah and I skipped it or initially </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm like watching [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cartoons yeah I'm a grown-ass man I grew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up because it was real again cuz like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know my parents and they're all my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> family and cousins and whatever like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were telling you like dude stop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching cartoons right your honor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> alright so I initially skipped it but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for some reason I did a double take like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> two or three weeks later read the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> synopsis and I thought okay this sounds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty [ __ ] sick yeah yeah and if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's in the top ten it's got to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty good right yeah watched one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> episode I I had to school the next day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I stayed up the whole night up until </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> school I had to leave with two episodes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> left yeah a wash I binge did the whole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> season of Death Note yeah one night and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my god I just immediately feel I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> became obsessed like it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> overnight I had just come like all my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other plans to watch all these famous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> movies and TV show yeah get that out of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone on YouTube said watch Code Geass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I'm gonna do that yeah and it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like obviously that phase where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> discover all like the golden anime it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like Bangor after Bangor and it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like three months straight where you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like all you think about is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> watching the next Anam good like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember that thing I've missed that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> fall so much everything she watched was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> amazing you know like I look back at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some of the [ __ ] now like going through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this phase where I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was obsessed with Love Hina right okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if we all had that face back of the day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> can I ask what was the show that ruined </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that for you I do remember because I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know exactly how it was for me not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because like I feel like once you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> watched enough anime or you start like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do you remember the feeling of the void </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right avoid where you watch this really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really good show you're like no one's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna top this not nothing's gonna top </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this and you just feel empty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hit your boo oh and then and then the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> more shows you watched more the more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that void shrinks right they were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you find the next amazing show right you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were like and then you watch enough and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> then you find like your top ten favorite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shows yeah yeah and then that's that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of when it starts cementing for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to like to the next phase where you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> start watching stuff and it's not as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good a feeling as when you first started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so what was it for you then school days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cuz I I decided I distinctly remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this okay and I remember being really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> annoyed about it and I'm not saying that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for the meme is totally accurate cuz I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can I never escaped school okay so you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> want to know you all know what's even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worse right is that so I was watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime on YouTube still at this point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right so I remember because I would get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd get a my anime list because that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what I have one did right like you would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look at which ones are high rated and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which ones yeah for some reason school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> daze was like one of the highest rated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but but it was like it was like it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like split right between light it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> either a 10 or a 2 yeah and I thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna be in the 10 calories yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything I've watched so far [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> long yeah so first off I already had a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bad start watching school days because I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember watching school days HQ or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> something and it was like like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> spin-off it was like 40 minutes of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> course cool days HQ to explain is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> original visual novel of school days but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the original visual novel of school days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was basically just a full-on anime yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> right it was all animated I didn't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that this is the first time I just found </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that out yeah so you can watch you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> watch all the school days HQ on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something like pornhub or less videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which if you're really just like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're really just looking to watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the you know clips that you're looking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for you can just find it oh and they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would have showed the clips and that I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't get that far I got about soos a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 40 minute episode one right and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watched 40 minutes and I was like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't this isn't seem right am i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching the right thing like everyone's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> saying it's good right it's so funny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that you saying like the school days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like mal is either like a tan or yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know you didn't say [ __ ] going on here I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know what mindset you're in where you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> were like every time I'm in the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> hood that sheep right who everyone else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is set at 10 and he doesn't want to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that one guy who's like I don't think I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have good taste no way I have good taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I can appreciate it Scott because for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right like school days was like it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crap until the last episode because the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> last episode I was like first of all I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember just like sitting there I'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna say it but I'm sure there's lots </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of maleic school days for me that ending </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just like the most satisfying thing I'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever seen it okay okay I will give you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it was satisfying but then I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remembered like I just sat through 11 of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the most boring [ __ ] in my life yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think this is big enough to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> redeem it like the first the first 11 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> episodes was just like I think I need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anger management right yeah yeah oh my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> god I hate the main character so my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whole and then I've gone and then he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like the [ __ ] orgasm you got an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> episode 12 where what happened happens </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like oh yeah that ending for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me made it it in no I specifically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> remember I'm like I'm glad I went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> through those 11 episodes going no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's satisfying that's [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is bullet that's recency bias right cuz </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're you're basing your review of how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it ended not the [ __ ] the absolute </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] truck they do it to like a shovel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> okay no but let but he's the thing right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i I've said this so many times in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> videos but like the ending for me is so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] important because like I had got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that goldfish brain but iTunes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything outside </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the opposite experience with Deadman </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wonderland no I selected my guys cuz </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they may wanna let for me was amazing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first 10 episodes and the ending was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just the most garbage [ __ ] II like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> okay we ran out of budget ending that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I've ever seen that it just completely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ruling class doesn't mean it's a one I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> mean I get devil in Wonderland the anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like a 5 what no no it's better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> than a 5 because then I read the manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and the monk is infinitely better you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> think so yeah I thought whether because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the manga actually ends it's better than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the [ __ ] anime I guess I am a reading </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Deadman Wonderland and I kind of liked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what it did a little bit but the ending </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wasn't too big with fan over them all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right but even if it was like a mediocre </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> ending right ending at least I got an ok </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ending whereas the anime just left me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> wanting more and I'm like don't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tease me like that after 10 amazing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> episodes would you rather a show that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has like 10 amazing episodes with with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no ending or 24 episodes with 10 amazing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> episodes and it starts to go kind of man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the endings a little questionable the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> first writers what we got with dead man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> there yeah angers and that's why I but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh I'm trying I'm just trying to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like wrap my head around how you could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> justify like I've just been sitting here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for like the past few minutes having a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] mental let me let me rephrase </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let me rephrase okay I had so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> opinion changes on the ending to school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> days like sorry okay so what would you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> give school days now then now I would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> give it a 6 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> no no I had a phase where I'm like is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this ending genius or is it the worst </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> garbage if I if I like you know if I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make a character that is so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> abhorrent and then I kill him off oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah you should he's not even a good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> character like there's not a good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> character it was exactly the reason why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the ending all it's satisfying but it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just so [ __ ] surface-level you know I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> mean I wouldn't watch it again he he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> liked this protagonist it's the one that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we follow he made this character dog </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] on purpose but then there's also a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> little bits where he tries to make you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the guy and that's the words right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's what I [ __ ] hey is like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we sympathize with this con you had like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a threesome in like class three be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the [ __ ] you just had like a dad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the one character development </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that uh what the folks Makoto had that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> noses named makoto valued I complete </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because he's so [ __ ] plans I couldn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even remember his [ __ ] I can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember any of the character I love the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> one derivative all the Makoto hat is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that he started out as is like absolute </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> synthase kya needs of these most like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the Giga chat and I'm the episode for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that made me like had to like pause and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go like was like the wind when they want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of the have like a threesome </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like Poston I was like should chop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> them up there chop the [ __ ] mutt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there so like like it was literally a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> porn plot how it happened it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> schooldays hate you there's a pond </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the worst thing about it right is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it they try and sell you that it's not a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> poor plot and then they hit you with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in front of my salad plot and you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like no this isn't what I want like and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the fact that people on mal had the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] balls to be like this is an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> artistic masterpiece of our generation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the timing is impeccable it's like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it's like yeah okay if my dog </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got rabies and I watched it die that for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three hours yeah I'd probably see it put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down B would be satisfying right because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just suffering that's what that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime was he was just suffering I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] hated it and the fact that I had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to then watch 40 minutes of a let's play </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever the [ __ ] it was the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing I did watch that and the worst </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> part was is that imagine okay before you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could even start the dog [ __ ] power that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the [ __ ] school days you had to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watch 40 minutes of the same thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before you started the same thing again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I remember watching the first episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> already bored out of my mind because I'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seen this [ __ ] before in it in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> slightly different way and I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> okay I hate school this school day sucks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] I'm just having a [ __ ] mental </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> breakdown right now because I thought I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had left school days in the past I never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> thought I'd hear though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> two words again I'd be sitting next to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the guy who Lucas cuz I remember that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mal phase and I thought they must </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone must be trolling yeah this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like the interspecies reviewers kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing everyone's giving this a ten </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's being [ __ ] ironic there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no way that there can be a guy I'm sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there were I'm sure there were but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't imagine I couldn't imagine you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> all ironically gave it a turn I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't I just I just remember like I had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a video like this is look were you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> corrected your opinion no not enough I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean two videos I had I had a video the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> first video I ever made on school days </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was right after I finished watching it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think like a six year old video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's cold like is the school days ending </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a masterpiece or something like that oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> my god it's just like me going like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah okay it's like it's like imagine if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Code Geass is ending right you had that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then 25 episodes was just as fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> following like like Nunnally like just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah her daily life you know I mean like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that shit's boring I don't [ __ ] see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like it wasn't like okay the ending </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was satisfying but it was just it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just a boring show it was a boring show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for half of it and then the second half </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was just like anger management I think I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gave us such a high score because I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> appreciated the meta behind how the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> director and producer chose the little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> worst ending of any visual novel in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> existence it was like grade-a trolling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my opinion and I think that's why I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> said it was kind of Jean I mean it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely different like that anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was not like an ending like that we you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't I said why we're still talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about school days after [ __ ] how many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> years of it's me now yeah but okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's the thing right is that sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what what is a good ending right is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is do it do you think it as a good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ending because if the story made sense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it really like in the whole thing it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like wow that's a great ending it really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made sense all the characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> built up to this no it's a good ending </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the main character was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> awful and everyone in that show was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> god-awful yeah we just wanted to see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> them get like revenge but I'm like but I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> would argue that like an ending that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good right doesn't necessarily have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> be memorable right there's a difference </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> between a memorable ending </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and a good it's a memorable I mean it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just like pure shock factor right it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just like pure shock factor and it's got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> not much substance behind that shock </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right right right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was my big problem with school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> days because at least with the visual </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> novel you could see [ __ ] sex scenes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for one get some tips he's getting 316 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> oh [ __ ] exactly cuz ELISA in that what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> he actually makes made sense why he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting all this [ __ ] [ __ ] did it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did it made sense because he was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] hint I'm the visual what in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> anime because they didn't explain the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> hentai sub porn yeah or the subtext I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> guess that it is like a hint I I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that was the first time as a teenager </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there that I was like Oh sex again like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> really we're gonna go with sex again all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> right geez that's like the age where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like you start to be like beyond those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kinds of like six and poop jokes where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's all about like like challenging my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sixteen-year-old atheist brain then it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not good material you know I mean I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty sure I watched that like peepee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> poo-poo thing that made me laugh on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> YouTube like two weeks ago so I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> know why I'm fully gone but right but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like it always goes back right light </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'll often poop jokes at age 10 not at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> age 15 and then you'll offer poop jokes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> again at age 20 I being a teenager is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] weird that's actually it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] whiff because teenagers we horny </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> as [ __ ] right yeah I guess when you're a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> teenager you wanna this is weird thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that you don't do as an adult right when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're an adult you fully accept what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're into as a teenager you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to mold your interest into what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you think yeah yeah yeah I felt like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shows that you watched which is probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why this guy gave mallet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I have [ __ ] schooldays of Tani's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to be this smart you can see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> through all the [ __ ] to see that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> masterpiece I fully admit that's exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not gonna sit here and say like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> did that too right yeah I'm out there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a part of me that would argue that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Prison Break was a masterpiece of art </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm right when I look back now maybe the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] was like thinking I was 15 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you know like it's when you're a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> teenager you have dumb opinions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you should never start an energy channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in your no no you're very highly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> regretted later on my first video was on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] bleach how old do you started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube then 17 oh [ __ ] okay I would see </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> 20 yeah I started my youtube in 19 right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> holy crap some of the stuff that I said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I I look back now and you know you look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> back and you know the motives as well to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> why you said the dumb [ __ ] yeah yeah oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> never have now right of course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like you you're like I want to be seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in this way so I'm gonna say opinion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that isn't really mine but I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> who will view me if I like I look like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my son my first videos and I [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> cringe man I could not finish them oh my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> god I'm so [ __ ] glad that the way the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> internet was it was like the perfect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time I think for when I was growing up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like yeah there is still the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of thing of you could say whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the [ __ ] you wanted I got away with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right like I'm sure I said some [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> horrible stuff on runescape and Xbox </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Live people right off like you know now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean kind of stuff gets hold against </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you yeah yeah I'm glad that I had that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> room to grow room to know that school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> days was garbage you know without having </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to make a video about it I mean my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> school days is a masterpiece guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> actually make a video what you did you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh your channel we're watching five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes I kind of watch it cuz so cringy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's like me and like a [ __ ] late </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> during the era where like known as the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guy as to where the wheel hats yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had like I had a like a chop I had those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the hugely chop behind and I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also wearing this like rainbow beanie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with like a scarf attached to any [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> love to cross to save the leaves I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know why anyone was like oh yeah this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> guy's looks good but like yeah like on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ironically I was like you know what now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I'd like mulling it over I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> school days is ending is really freaking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's a channel right now like I'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> keep that [ __ ] up because it is getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a drive he's gonna I can't I like to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> keep it up until I kind of remind my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> audience that like you know I used to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like this but now obviously I've changed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> my view on school days and a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shows because I've as you said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had the room to grow now and the room to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> watch yeah I think it's funny to look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> back here old videos where your cringes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] yeah I used to be like this is what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like now you know yeah I mean you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> can see clear improvement I like I like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> seeing the growth you know yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that feels good it feels it hurts to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch some of your older videos I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> actually watched it and I'm like I sound </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so much more British yeah so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't realize such a northern accent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah start of YouTube well when I made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you you have like the thickest Walsh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> accent yeah it's kind of been like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> destroyed yeah which is nice you know I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean I use to be clearly here but I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think that's to coincide with all like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> YouTube growth I think you have that as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well especially in your tastes and anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're a teenager and what you like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you know you can allow yourself a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trash taste for a reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Joey's Joey's really pulling his weight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on that this episode has been on [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> point and to bring the trashy and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> alright if Seoul is gonna do is gonna be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me like why is it every podcast someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I can never escape for that's why I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think it's that it's that moment as an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anime fan when you watch school days and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like two paths which one are you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna go are you gonna go down like just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> admitting your tastes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like the modern-day like Pokemon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> versus Digimon yeah school days good old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> school days back it's like the anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> litmus test thank you well school days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just way more culturally important for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the anime fandom than I've realized that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> least for you know in the mid you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 2010 that right yeah I think that was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> big like taste indicator oh and also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anyone who said they liked it was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] liar at the time you know no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because at that time I remember this I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> felt like I was too [ __ ] the idiot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cuz I'm like the only guy that thinks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the show is garbage like okay school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> days come out it was like 2007 it was it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was during the Golden Age okay so 2007 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah cuz I think it was 2006 saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that right I watched that at like 2013 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and that was just that argument was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> still going on yeah until 2013 and a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sonic's aspect that's still going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> today </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously a lot lesser but I mean you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can argue that we brought it back yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how many anime do you know that have had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like discussions like that where it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like brought up time and it's so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> decisive well right I think this is the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> only anime that's like properly trashy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know enemies no it's no trap that it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just keeps being brought up because I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> can you know point shows like say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Evangelion or something that's you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we can discuss till the end of times and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> fans probably will discuss that too at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the end of time but in terms of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shows that I count as [ __ ] awful yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um school days is just a show that just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't a few slice the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> cockroach every time I step on it every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> time I think it'll never escape from it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> dude that's that's the beauty of school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 20 oh my god I love how this was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like search for your origin story in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Texas the downfall of anime the absolute </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] roasting of my 10 out of 10 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> opinions just like a Brazos of anime you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know it's just like that's basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what it is it's like an action if like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if a browsers had a good ending we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably all be arguing about it right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the equivalent it's like it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah so heated about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it I just it gives like a visceral </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> reaction to everyone who dislikes this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> guys are living adapt I'm just looking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> forward to the giant discussion this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna cause and like the Sabra it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna be a whole threat again this time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I am interested to see what you the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> viewers you have seen school they think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of it and yeah if you're wrong on I mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I I said anything else we can talk about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> over then I think that's a good place to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> end if yeah I feel like that's that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just took the wind out of my sails I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know how I can possibly be calm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about anything else today but you do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> have something important about our we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually started the trash taste patreon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as you can see the production value is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> quite high for this podcast and we have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> editors helping us and stuff and it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> whole system that we have and sadly it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't fund itself it's a lot of money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to run basically I just want to talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about because you know I feel like when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we were making this podcast we didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> want to settle for like cheap production </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> values we wanted this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be you know comparable to any other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> high budget pot yeah yeah like to us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this was a passion project yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we've put quite a lot of our own savings </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> into that's an understatement </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> expensive like you know several thousand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dollars into making this and plus you </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> us are pretty well off we'd be fine if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we just don't want our passion project </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to be bleeding money which right now it </SPEAKER_02>
