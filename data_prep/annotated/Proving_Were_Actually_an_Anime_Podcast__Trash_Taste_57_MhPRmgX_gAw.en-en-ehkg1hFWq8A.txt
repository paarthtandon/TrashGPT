<SPEAKER_01> - I'll give you a quick run-through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of Dhar Mann video right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hi, I am cheating wife. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (moody music) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hi, I am husband with failing business. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Damn, you're so gross. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to cheat on you, she cheats. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (coins clanking) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My business is now succeeding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cheating wife wants to come
back and sleep with him again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but he's like, no, no, I'm successful now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Moral of the story, don't
cheat on your husband. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (bones cracking) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, then everyone clapped. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (applause) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (chill ambience music) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Welcome to Trash Tastes Podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is the most recent episode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll ever experience
on Trash Taste, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. This is the first time, I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> since we started that we used
the entirety of our backlog. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So we can talk about topics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that happens literally just last week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as this is airing right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whoa! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which, I actually do want to, but- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Timely! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But, I did see a thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were like, please, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can you start talking
about more recent topics? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so annoying hearing
it like four weeks later. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I like the fact that we get
to like sit on it a little bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and we get to talk about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, it comes out later. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause so much happens
or so much changes, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Especially if it just happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you know, something might happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it completely changes
our opinions or situations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then we just look like idiots. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just poorly, aged videos, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, I think it
just works well for us as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it just proves that, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we don't have to talk about
current topics to get people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to watch us hopefully. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - By the way do you want
to introduce ourselves? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We're here with the boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think I did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hello we're the boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We really just like went right into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're the boys, that's it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hello, this is like
episode two of season two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You know who we are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know who we are, obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think episode 54 was
like five weeks ahead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the episode after that was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one week ahead.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's like, it's interesting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I do like the fact that, I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the way we record it, is cause that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how we like to do it,
right? - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We like to have the backlog
so that we always give you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an episode weekly and we
don't really give a shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about trending topics, most of the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] No. No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think we want to just talk anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Most trending topics just don't mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> anything to us really. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and even then really, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we don't really go that deeply into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, we're not doing
a two hour deep dive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on the newest scandal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] I mean how- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We just kind of mention
it in passing like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, that was a shitty thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is what I will
be talking about today. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean how can you when
it literally just happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you have so little
information to work off, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, and also I feel like
we're not, like a drama channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you want the hot
scoops, the hot takes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not from us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] No.
- [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have hot takes about
fucking food and all other shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We have hot takes about
like non-timely topics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But speaking of hot topics, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there is one that came up
recently that I thought was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just so incredibly fucking stupid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I do want to talk about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Go on. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I tweeted about it yesterday, as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was the crypto, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the crypto scam, but the FaZe Clan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I tweeted about
that yesterday as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not being funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you believe in any financial advice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from someone from the FaZe Clan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - FaZe Clan! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have to start
questioning what's going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I know most of this kids are, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, I don't think most of them are young </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because how the fuck do
they have crypto wallets? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm 25 and I barely can
get a crypto wallet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Very, very, very naive parents. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I am all out the loop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Can you explain to me what I missed? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah that's right, Garnt, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So FaZe Clan, which if you don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are an absolutely massive
organization on YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They have members that I can not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> distinguish to save my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They all sound and feel
very familiar in my head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's also like 70
of them or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. There's like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a shitload of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I don't know how many there is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's about like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think there's less than 10 of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're all massive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, there's more than 10. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is there? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There has to be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just know that they are gamers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're gamers, so ya
they're mainly gamers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They mainly do, you know,
very click-bait videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A lot of them to cover very hot games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So like, when it's Fortnite,
they're Fortnite, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they kind of pick
up the biggest creators. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Most of them have over
like 5 million subs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So most of them have
over 10 million subs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And a few of them have recently started, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, advertising cryptocurrencies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I like where this is going! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It seems to have been a concerning topic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with influencers in general recently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where they've been-
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, I don't mind you talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about your crypto investments and whatnot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, there's a difference between that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and being like, "Hey, invest in whatever." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So there was the big scandal this time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was that, there was a coin called </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Save the Kids- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah.
- [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Foundation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's literally called like,
this is like a parody. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, this is what, like a parody movie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would call this scam.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Save the Kids. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it had like all of them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it had this like flashy promotional video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where all of them were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm here to save the kids," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all the FaZe Clan members were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm holding to save the kids." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so they advertise this coin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they also like had someone
who helped them develop it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So they were in from the start developing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this coin, making it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
[Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So they had all the coin
before even went live. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And if you don't know
how cryptocurrency works, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not gonna explain it
because, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's videos on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Frankly I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All I know is that they had the money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before they had access to this marketplace </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before anyone did, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they already had all the money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They promoted the fuck out of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it's typically called
a pump and dump, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you promote the shit out of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The value goes up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then you sell off your- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then, they sold all
of their coin immediately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So when this coin went up in value </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it went immediately to shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There's actually graphs
of it that you can see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like, day one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like up here and then it just goes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (imitates falling rocket) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah so I think it started
off like one, one penny, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was worth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - These coins. And then it was, well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think now it's worth less
than a hundredth of a penny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's like a
thousandth of of a penny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's even less than that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah, it's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Feels like that should be illegal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it might be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, if you did this stuff like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the stock market, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it would be very illegal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. That's what I'm saying, right! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like some Wolf of
Wall Street shit, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that's the... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I feel like I'm
just the guy watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the shit show that is crypto. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't really give a
about getting into crypto, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I love keeping up with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and love seeing the drama. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're always just
at each other's throat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on whether they want regulation or not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so that's the debate of do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should it be regulated to stop shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this from happening? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But even then I think the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if the FEC, or I think that's what it is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wanted to investigate, I
think they could arrest them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And, someone actually
found their wallets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Their crypto wallets, which is unique </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to the person who buys or sells a crypto. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You can only have one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. It's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or you can have more than one wallet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's a unique thing
that everyone can see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause crypto is public. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so people managed to
find the FaZe Clan's wallets, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And saw that at least one
of them, a bunch of them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a bunch of them all sold immediately, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which shows that they kind
of had some malicious intent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And one of them had done like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> four of these schemes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and sold immediately every single time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (snickering) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And bear in mind, if
this was for, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these people have like 10 million subs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So their income is probably
already over, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> seven figures a year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so they're doing these,
I mean, they're just scams. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's blatantly what they are, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, these, these, these are just- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Call it what it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a fucking scam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is a scam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're running these scams that could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> easily put them in jail. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And some of them only made like 50 grand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And don't get me wrong 50
grand is a lot of money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a lot of money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But in retrospect of how much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're already probably making. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bro if they did a raid
fucking Shadow Legends, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'd get 100K, are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> why are they risking their life for 50K? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's not a lot in like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the grand scheme of things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the amount that they're making </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and for what they're
putting on the line as well? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like going into tax evasion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like save a tenner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, what are the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what the fuck are they doing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At least, at least when you rob people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you can wear a ski mask. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like, they're
fucking promoting it publicly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then their fucking wallets are public. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought they were
like making millions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's what it sounds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what it sounded like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's sounded so elaborate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And so like crazy that I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these guys must be getting
millions from this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> No, they made like 60K. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, what you
guys are so fucking dumb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is the dumbest thing I've seen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like at least with the fucking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole Tmartn CSGO gambling thing- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, Yeah. That's
what they remind me of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At least he was
probably making millions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. Easily. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you're gonna like risk your life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least, that's what pissed
me off the most about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, you guys are so fucking dumb. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I couldn't believe this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, when I saw it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just upload a couple of vlogs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just add a shitload of minerals, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, you'd probably
make the same amount. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah. It's just, I, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I've watched channels
that are dedicated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to finding these like crypto scams </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's so many YouTubers doing this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so appalling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so sad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's pretty fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like the more like I've
seen people reacting to it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I've just never looked into
what was going on myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It just seems like, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> very much like the CSO skim scam, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I forget what that scam was called. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kind of like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but at least at least gambling, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's something there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just lose with this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> then you just getting scammed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - At least you get skins. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah this is like a
butterfly knife. I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't get anything
with this crypto shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, and there was a bunch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of other YouTubers were
doing it too, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's quite a lot. Quite a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, I think like, I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Rice Scum, I think was involved
in the FaZe thing as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - For fuck's sake! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well Rice Scum is in FaZe Clan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was in FaZe Clan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So he was part of the campaign as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because I saw- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then Sam Pepper is apparently, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you remember Sam Pepper? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs and claps) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So Sam Pepper is a well known, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very well known prank channel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was canceled a while back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Of course he is known. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's very popular right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because he's doing crypto scams. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are we just going through
like the fucking top 10 list </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of YouTuber scumbags that were- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Literally, literally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because, that's what
it sounds like, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pick a YouTube scumbag, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're doing this cyrpto bullshit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're literally doing crypto bullshit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Logan Paul was doing it as well, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Logan Paul, yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Logan Paul was pushing this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course he was! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never, been one for like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you should lose your platform for stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But, I genuinely think if
you're doing this shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you shouldn't be allowed on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well yeah of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How YouTube let's like
people who do this shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like still upload. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like, cause it's, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we already have a bad
enough rep as YouTubers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We already have like one of
the worst reps of any reps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The last thing we need
is every single person over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 10 million subs fucking
shilling garbage crypto </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is blatantly a scam. You know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's so shitty as well, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like internet
personalities are like built </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> on like a trust, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Of like, I love this content creator. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who is trusting these guys? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love these people.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And, what I want to know is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how they're getting away with this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's no regulation on it,. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, as much as you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of people don't want
websites to get involved. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Rightfully so, because
YouTube and Twitter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they normally try and enforce shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a fucking mess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's kind of this thing of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> well maybe there should be exceptions, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they're notably being scumbags. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean, I don't even know is if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what they're doing is illegal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but I assume if it is illegal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then that is like a genuine
reason to de-platform them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It definitely feels illegal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's for sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It definitely feels illegal! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> This definitely shouldn't feel illegal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever they're doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, that's literally
like being like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'll give you $10 JK it's 10 cents." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, it's literally that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just don't understand what sick fuck, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like builds up this audience, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then just is like, "All right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just going to take their
money," like, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well again that's, what's
the shitty thing, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, it's built on a trust system. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your viewers trust you as a personality. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] It's so shat. It's so shat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They'll listen to
anything you say, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Being like, "Oh, well, if my
favorite content creators says, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I should do this, I
should probably do this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, so I feel it works both ways, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, obviously
influencers are kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of fucked in a sense, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they're literally taking advantage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of a fan base that trusts them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But, at the same time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the viewers aren't really
thinking for themselves, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're not thinking like,
hmm, this might be a scam. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's hard. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause you do like, it's unfortunate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> People do build up trust. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, for some reason, they trusted someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with the name FaZe in front of their name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, it's just, it's sad, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just, the idea of someone
like looking up to this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this person who plays
Fortnite or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fortnite. (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We clearly are very knowledgeable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about what FaZe Clan does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know and a- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is the most gamer
one out of us three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and even he's having
trouble describing them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's that side of gaming that is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> blatantly marketed towards, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, under 16 year olds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not really into that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, and it's sad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just really sad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just don't understand
how you could go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a meet and greet ever and
look, your fans in the eye, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and be like, I'm so glad to meet you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, no you're fucking not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Thank you for changing my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're just a fucking
wallet, when you need them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's one thing to
like e-beg in various ways. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, I think this is just like a- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's e-steal isn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're just like stealing, it's fucked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like what blows my
mind hearing the story is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there are so many legitimate
ways to make money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is not this shady. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean fuck you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like how much did Logan Paul and Jake Paul </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> make from like a fucking
boxing match, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what blows my mind- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that Logan Paul </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> must have made what, 20,
$30 million from that fight? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then he's here promoting
dink donk, coin of dinged, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever it is, fucking coin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some dumb ass fucking name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, what are you doing, man? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're already fucking rich as shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you really need to do this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, this is what blows my mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't understand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, cause, like I've
thought that, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as much as they are
scumbags and everything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They're also like fucking geniuses </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for being able to monetize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how fucking hated they are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because they've made millions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from doing boxing matches. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I'm just like, well, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was pretty clever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll give you the rep for,
you know, monetizing your- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - At least you're putting
your body on the line, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah monetizing you being a scumbag. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then there's just
this, which is, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not nowhere near as
profitable as getting punched </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the face, and I'd much
rather get punched in the face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thank you very much, (Joey
laughs) honestly, honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah no, honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Jeez. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If I have the options to
get punched in the face, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or do the sponsorship, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd be like punch me
in the face every time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do I get paid the same amount? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah same amount. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just a flesh wound. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the would you rather, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Would you rather get punched
in the face for $20 million </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or scam people out of crypto for $50,000? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or do an illegal act? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Which would you rather do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Man, it's just sad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The whole thing is so
sad every time I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh yeah, YouTube is, a lot
of them are pretty bad huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And guaranteed as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, when this does break
out into like, the mainstream, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if it hasn't fucking already, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like news outlets are going to pick it up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're going to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "These Youtubers are
doing blah, blah, blah." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know what sucks is that, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they might be douche bags. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of these guys are
like the faces of YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So seeing them, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like represented of YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as a whole and doing
these like shitty things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's going to make us look like shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even though we're sitting here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally laughing at them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for being how fucking dumb they were. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah it sucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean I always look
at that side of YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's just so alien to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I don't normally keep up with like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how can I say like, the kind of like side </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of YouTube, which is mostly like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess based in LA </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and mostly like aimed towards, yeah, like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The LA YouTube scene, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> The LA YouTube scene is just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's notorious of just being insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is like a different world to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't get it sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. And I would like to say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they don't obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> represent all of YouTube, but I think- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's obvious to like
most of our audience, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I feel like there's
very little audience- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like crossover between our stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and their stuff to begin with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But, that's why I'm holding
Trash Taste coin, guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Make sure to have those diamonds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - TT coin! The TT coin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hold your diamond hands. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Trash Taste, fucking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Could you imagine? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Monkey coin rise up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Monkey coin! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Monkey coin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That'll be it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's probably already
a thing to be fair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Probably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's so many coins. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Well probably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - My God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What else you guys been up to, huh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well I see what you guys have been up to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's getting your
first vaccine shot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was broadcasted live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. We did do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - On my Japanese television. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] That's all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got like fucking stared down by like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the Minister of Health or whatever he was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. The- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What was he again? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I guess the
Anthony Fauci of Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, essentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, we got a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is it weird to say that
our vaccine was sponsored? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - This vaccine is sponsored by. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And, it was in a sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It kind of was, but not really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was, and it wasn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, you know, I don't know what- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We didn't get paid to get vaccines. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So I guess it wasn't sponsored. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so the, the
company that we work for, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's obviously a
subsidiary of a subsidiary, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is owned by Kadokawa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And Kadokawa in Japan, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I disagree with this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They were only really
giving the vaccines out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to big companies with over a
thousand employees, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To give so that they could
give it to their employees. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But, I just think that
you should just give it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to anyone who wants it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause apparently, you know, people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> all the population here haven't
been too receptive to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They haven't been
taking it much, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So yeah. They had it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And, I believe Kadokawa, was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, well let's
make it a press event." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah because Dwango,
which is the company </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that owns Niconico, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like, the Japanese
YouTube, essentially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They wanted to do this
program where they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we need to get foreigners
living in Japan vaccined. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We want to show that off are being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "It doesn't matter if you're a foreigner, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can get vaccined here guys, yeah." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, like every foreigner
living here, isn't like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can you just give me the
fucking vaccine already? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like we know the vaccine exists. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They were like, "Well,
Trash Tastes has a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of foreigners in it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So they were like, "Yeah,
you can have the vaccine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you go on TV." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was thinking like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fuck well it could be
months before I get it here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know why I'm
going to get it. You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, it's not like
I've never done this before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck it, I'll get stabbed on TV. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. At least again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> at least you weren't given
the death glare, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> On TV? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah well so what happened was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we turn up to this place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and we fill out a form
and there's already like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> people like shuffling us around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, obviously it's
a very strange experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if you've never been
on like a press thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And to be honest, we haven't been on many, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but essentially you turn up at a place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then like a group
of 10 people are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Come here, come here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do this thing. Do this thing." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they're shoving you around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll just keep following." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you like, "Just
fill out this form. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fill it out now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right. Okay. Fuck it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, come here, come here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You gotta get to do this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I'm like, "All right,
well, all right, well shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What's going on? Fuck.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Meanwhile, this entire time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this entire thing is live-streamed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> On Niconico in front of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was like 35,000 people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what 35,000
people are just watched. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are just sitting there watching
people getting vaccinated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not sure if it was
total views of live viewers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was live views. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and so- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But, I saw how many comments there were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just like completely
filled up the screen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So with Niconico, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not like YouTube comments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you can read them down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on like on like the bottom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, if you comment something it like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> appears live on the feed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's pretty cool, but
also really distracting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah it's really distracting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a cool feature I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. So then we get shuffled across </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to this other room with like 20 cameras, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a bunch of people and me and Joey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just looked so out of place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because everyone is wearing suits. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we're just like, "All right." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And Connor and I are
rocking in our JoJo shirts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah we were in JoJo shirts, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because I was like "If I'm going TV, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm wearing JoJo merch." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they were like, "Sit down here." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And, I was like, "Okay, cool." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And literally like two seconds later </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after they told us to sit down, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the Health Minister- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Comes around the corner and like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Emperor Palpatine,
just stares us down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, "Yes." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah what the fuck was
up with that death stare </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he gave you guys? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, so before that as well right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Before that. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's like, he's like, "How was it?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And we were, and Joey,
didn't say anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. He looked at me and
he was, like, in English, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> he was like, "How was it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, I was this
close to being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Bro, I literally just walked in." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like we haven't gotten it yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> We're waiting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so Joey, he didn't respond. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And we were really awkward,
because we were like confused. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then, as he's walking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Oh, we haven't had it yet." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he goes, "Oh," and
then just walks off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then has a five minute conversation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the Japanese cosplayers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And me and Joey are like,
"All right, well. Okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right. Should we go get it now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, wait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There were Japanese cosplayers there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah there was someone
from Final Fantasy Seven </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> next to me, just chilling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just in cosplay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - In cosplay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. In cosplay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was really strange. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was this like a vaccine like event, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or was this a fucking
anime expo or something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think, I think the event was to like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They were Japanese influencers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. They Japanese influencers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh. Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it was like foreign influencers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese influencers, musicians, talents, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So they just came in costume? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. They came in costume. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's so weird! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I think while we
don't really give a shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the Japanese talent very much- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Care about upholding the image. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah like the image. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Okay. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And, me and Joey were like fuck it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're just tell them joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess that's upholding the image. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, when I was getting the vaccine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> from my periphery, like I
could see from my periphery, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just the Health Minister
staring down at me, like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] It was this really funny video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like four angles of this guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just staring at Joey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with like a whole press team behind him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was really bizarre. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It looks so fucking ominous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was really ominous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like a scene from
like fucking JoJo or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It looked like a parody. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like when, especially when
they like zoom in on you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like, this
is like built for memes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's like, "Yes, the Anime Man." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like literally, Emporer
Palpatine just walking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> around with his like subordinates. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It's like, "Do it!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Snap him!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, cause when I went, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I went like a
few hours afterwards, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because I was busy winning
a Shadowverse tournament </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - GG by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I came in afterwards, and it
was like pretty chill for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't have any cameras, no interview. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you guys have to do
interviews or anything like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, we just went on like
a livestream afterwards </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and said, watch Trash Tastes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Did you, did you
have to sit in front of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there was like a weird like shrine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> looking thing after you got the shot? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] A shrine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So after we got the shot, one of the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was like seven camera angles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on this Niconico live stream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But one of the camera angles was through, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was on this table and it was through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these like Torii gates. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was a really shit angle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was a really shit angle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You could barely see our faces, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but basically they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> once we got the shots done, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we came out, and they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, sit down and give us a couple </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like words on how your experience was." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So Connor and I got sat in
front of this Torii shrine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And they were like, "How was it?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "Its a
fucking needle, wasn't it?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've done this before, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just, it's just the vaccine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then, we use that as the opportunity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like watch Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn, promoting Trash
Tastes during a vaccine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I guarantee you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most of them didn't
understand what we said. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, it's all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the thought that counts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I saw Sydney's clip
where went in front of it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and she just says, yeah,
I'm an aero-gay YouTuber. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And she literally said that and
the comments were just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone thought she was like
a JAV actress or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Poor choice of words. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But, yeah, I mean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah, I guess I traded,
you know, I let them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we were Guinea pigs for the press </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that we could get vaccines. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Worth it. Honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Honestly like when, when we got the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when we got like the offer from Meilyne, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Meilyne just messages
us one day and was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Guys, good news. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can secure you guys a vaccine." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we're just like, "Great." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, as you know, as, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as hopefully many companies
are getting vaccinated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's fucking brilliant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, she was like,
"But there's a catch." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "What'd you mean
there's a fucking catch? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just, I just want to get vaccinated." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, "Well you can get it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you appear on Niconico
and livestream it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, "What kind of
sponsorship offer is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is like literally the
weirdest sponsorship offer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've ever heard in my life." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've never done anything with Niconico. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not really a sponsorship. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> We didn't have to do much, just turn up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It kind of felt like it at the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but it wasn't technically
a sponsorship offer, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Slowly getting there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> First jab complete. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Next one in the end of this month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. End of this month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then, we'll be fully 5G'd up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Fully 5G positive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm honestly impressed,
because it just seemed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a switch just like flicked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like the Japanese vaccination program. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like, we went from no vaccines </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to everyone's getting a vaccine now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well yeah, because I think its </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the government finally realized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They were like, "Olympics is a month away, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and no one's been vaccinated yet." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They were like, yeah
that's not a good look. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We should probably do
something about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because Japan, normally isn't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't used to really having eyes on them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They don't really kind
of very much like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And now they have all
the eyes on them watching. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally everything
they do and criticizing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So they're not, I don't think
they're like used to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. But- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - America is like, "First time, huh?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got these like really
fucking awful back pains. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Did you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like the day after I
got the vaccine shot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most of the time it's
like, oh my, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my left arm or whatever
arm you got was sore, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only I got it on the
left arm and this entire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> part was just aching, like fucking crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was like, I'm feeling sleepy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm feeling drowsy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Meanwhile, I woke up the next day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, I feel like someone just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like drop kicked me in the back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So strange I've never heard anyone say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they got back pain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's weird right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And, it's like only me
and Aki are the only ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that have got this side effect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone else was just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bro if I scream too loudly, you might, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you might fucking turn into a titan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was about to say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Obviously you were just injected </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with that fucking titan juice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's probably why.
That's probably why- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor screaming) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why the health
minister was there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was going to say that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> He better not be going fucking titan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like they give you the vaccine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with a bottle the wine there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We got to put spoiler
warnings for that, that joke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like fucking
Historia looking at me, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like you better
turn into a fucking titan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I swear to god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're going to put a
spoiler warning, fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's probably the first
ever just casual spoiler </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we've ever done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This episode is sponsored by Bokksu. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> I was extremely tired of the day of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And, I couldn't do anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I decided I was
going to watch a TV show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was an animation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not quite an anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Oh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or, technically an
anime, technically in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is an anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is an anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I watched Invincible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (instrumental music) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (blood splatters) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it good? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. It's amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I need to watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, there must be a reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> why this show's getting memed a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was really blown away by how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just incredible it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cut to title screen right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (exciting music) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Not invincible. Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Incredible. Sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, what are you fucking doing?. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, oh, I love the Disney movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Incredibles. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I love the Disney movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not Pixar. Fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, fuck man, it's so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I just, I want season two now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you sell it to me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, what's it about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I know it's about superheroes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's kind of hard to sell
it without spoiling it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because there's a massive spoiler </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the very first episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. It's one of those things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it is literally the best show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to experience knowing nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause I almost think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that me seeing some of the memes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spoiled a bit for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, because I imagined
those twists would have been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so much more impactful if I
didn't know they were coming, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I knew they were coming, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I saw the memes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But, if anyone, I'm not going
to talk too much about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I will just say that it is
probably one of the best TV shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've watched in like the past year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is really fucking good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - How many episodes is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Eight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's only 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it eight? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Eight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Eight episodes, and
they're 45 minutes long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's, it's just amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's everything is fucking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you watch The Boys at all? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did not.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's very similar to The Boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's very similar to The Boys, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is funny that they are both </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Amazon Prime exclusives. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, if you didn't watch
The Boys, that's fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You just, it's a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd say a more brutal take on
the superhero genre, maybe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I heard The Boys is like
super fucking gory, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd say like The Boys
is more like humory. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Lot more humor involved,
whereas Invincible is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just like pretty brutal at times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just brutal. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Invincible was less of
like a, like a parody </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like a subversion
of the superhero genre </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and more of just like, ah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> describe it without spoiling
major plot points, so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a deconstruction maybe? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wouldn't say it was a deconstruction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like, you
know, if realistically, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if superheroes are just
randomly like powers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that were given out, some
people are going to be assholes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not that that's what
happens here, but it's again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to talk about it
much other than it is amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've watched it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Anyone watching this, if you've been, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've been thinking about
it, 100% go watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I've definitely
been thinking about that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the boys, so yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You should watch both because I like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with watching invincible, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was the first time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember after I finished the season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or finished the series, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was the first time
I had like an episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just really shock me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like, you know,
we watch a lot of anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We read a lot of media. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so it's been the
first time in a long time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where something has just
shocked me in that way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I just it's something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I just hadn't seen before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So that's why I think
it's really worth watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and watch it before
everyone starts jumping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> on this trend and everyone starts like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to fucking rip
them off or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Or do their own take on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was a comic before
if I'm not mistaken, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It was a comic before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, from what I've heard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I've been told, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we haven't really had too many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like comic book adaptations outside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the very safe family
friendly Marvel owned ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What I've been told and
what my friends tell me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like there's so many good stories </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the comic books that
have just not been touched. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, so many mature ones as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And, I'm hoping that this will lead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to more adaptations of
really fucking mature comics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I feel the last time we got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a mature comic adaptation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I thought was pretty
good or like, it wasn't good, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was really
entertaining was Sin City. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I never watched that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The movie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. That was originally
based off a comic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like Watchmen in the movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like that movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like that movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like how you just like
really whispered that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like Watchmen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like people
don't like that movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Isn't it Watchmen? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Watchmen. Yeah. It's Watchmen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Watchman. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Watchman. A watch man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's Inspector Gadget. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. Cause like I heard the same thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about Sin City as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like a lot of people,
like, "No. It was crap," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, it was like, it
was over the top, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But, I'm like, isn't it
supposed to be over the top? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a comic book. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure there's a bunch
of comic book aficionados </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the comment section that would tell us, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Actually, there's these
amazing adaptations out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because I heard that Watchmen was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just really hated by
everyone who read the comics, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I watched it and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought it was a good movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have no idea about the source material. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Same thing with a V for Vendetta as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Love V for Vendetta. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I fucking love that movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And apparently comic
book readers hated it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe they have a legitimate reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel that's the
same with like anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - From what I know it
could be fucking total- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bro, you're literally like calling out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> manga readers, right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It's literally
just all manga readers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like, "Oh no, it wasn't that good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The manga was way better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because literally the
comic book was wat better." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As an anime fan, I know how it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As a manga reader, I know how it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know we're going from
topic to topic fast here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but speaking of that kind of topic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of manga and anime
adaptations and whatnot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and not getting it right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I recently watched and
read Records of Ragnarok. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And know there's gonna be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause when I was live
streaming, people were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, well Netflix paid you to react to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you can't say a bad thing about it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, that's not true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] That's not true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We can say bad things about
it, and I'm going to do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So yeah. With, with that as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. We just reacted to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It wasn't like you
have to say good thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like react to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But you know, if you please, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> please don't be too mean, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. "Don't like rip us to shreds." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not going to be like, "Oh thank you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for bringing me here, Netflix. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Wow. This looks like shit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, when we're talking about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I will give my honest
opinions on the show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. To be fair, the scenes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we did react to were
probably the better scenes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. They definitely showed us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the better fight of the two, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> even then it was like, you
know, it was all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. It was- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially compared to
the manga, it was yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause, cause like I will say this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. We, you know, we obviously
were sponsored by Netflix </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to react to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we tried to give like, I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was honestly hype
for the show in general </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm a huge fan of the manga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I was pretty hype. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And, we were obviously shown, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we weren't showed the entire episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We were shown just like clips of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like five minutes of it, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like same thing as
like the trailer. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you know, I was, I honestly- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the opening
to Records of Ragnarok </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was fucking hype.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's Maximum the Hormone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maximum the Hormone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is the Death
Note's second opening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor screams) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So, it was fucking hype. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I honestly went
into it with high hopes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because, why wouldn't I? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And having, 'cause I watched
the final product as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I, yeah. I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I will say I am disappointed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with how it was adapted
because I feel like the fights </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> deserved better treatments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I don't know what happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the production process </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or what's kind of went
on behind the scenes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it wasn't the final product </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I was personally hoping for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it was fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I saw a lot of YouTube videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where people were like,
"It's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't support this shit. It's terrible." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, you don't want like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's still better than
a lot of adaptations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we've had like in recent memory, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I feel like they're bastardized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One Punch Man season two
way more than this did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't, man, some of
the One Punch Man fights </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> were so appalling in season two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. But I feel like, ah, I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a tough one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because, for both of them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I would recommend the
manga over the anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Definitely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. Yeah. 100%. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, even then reading
Records of Ragnarok going back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, yeah, this is cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And, you could do this anime adaptation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the way that I think people wanted, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's just never going to happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I don't think we're ever going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get the Record of Ragnarok adaptation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people wanted. Like-
- [Garnt] No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think the story is that good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where a company would
believe in it enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I read it. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like the story's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There isn't much of a story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's literally just a battle show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is fine. It's cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But, I was sitting there and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I could see why, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is never gonna be
the most popular manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like this is never going
to be in like the top 10. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It purely just builds
itself off like hype. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Am I wrong in saying that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, it doesn't need
to be in the top 10 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get a decent adaptation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we can talk about the Berserk adaptation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's definitely a top 10 manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Sure. Sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And look at the
adaptations it got, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've gotten so used
to the current climate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of adaptations we've been getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, I just
couldn't see like a show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is literally all
fighting like 24 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been done justice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where are anime is right now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I would say, look at
God of High School, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God of High School, has a very mid story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The story of the anime
was very mid as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but my fucking God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fight scenes and the
animation were absolutely amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like God of High School </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Records of Ragnarok
have a lot of similarities. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I mean, they're both
just like tournament arc, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the God of High
School had a big focus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on martial arts and like,
that kind of movement. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, I feel like that was specific </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to that director who knew very much- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean the director
was a very fucking talented </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's the same guy
who did Jujutsu Kaisen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but so I mean, I'm saying this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that, you know, it could
have got a good adaptation, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but unfortunately I don't think it got. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's the most
five out of 10 adaptation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Records of Ragnarok. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. It's pretty much
bog standard, I thought. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's a little, at
times it was disappointing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But, when I read the manga, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well, it kind of gives
you the same feeling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not going to lie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Genuinely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought the like the manga
art was fucking incredible- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. It is, but it's- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is, which is why like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've already sold me on this. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a mediocre story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's just a
fucking tournament arc, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's just dumb fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, it's just a
lot of fun and then like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just hypes the wrong story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know I'm going to get for this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I read both the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so there's a fight between
Adam of Adam and Eve, and Zeus, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] And Zeus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - and everyone was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "This is the most epic fight of all time." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And, I was like, "Yeah, it's pretty good." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was reading it and I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I actually think it
was better in the anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> even though it wasn't even that good." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you for real? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you actually for real? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That fucking screenshot
like fucking, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where the panel loads. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, it's literally
like reading the manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's literally reading the manga- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - With pretty animated slides. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Welcome to Trash Takes, everybody. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What is this take I'm hearing right now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just think that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You are the guy who couldn't get over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the fucking like animated manga </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like, what was it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Way of the Househusband? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And here you are in an actual
anime that needs animation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's an action
anime, and you prefer it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I realize this is
making me look terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember, because that's
just the way it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was some animation that I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "I don't like how this
looks," but I, this one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they literally just showed screenshots </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the fucking fight in the manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm like, you know what,
at least they just gave up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> At least they were like, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just don't even try. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I genuinely, I wish I wish I was joking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I know this is weird,
but I genuinely didn't care. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, that's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait. So you prefer the anime
adaptation of that fight to- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I watched the anime
and then I read the manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It might've been an order thing, but yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, yeah, I think I
just preferred watching the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nah. You're on crack, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're on crack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I really liked the music
and the voice acting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It added so much to it too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never fucking heard that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an opinion that's just so wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm to get grilled for this. I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want to know if there's
a single fucking person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> watching this right now that
will actually agree with you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who's like, "Yeah. Yeah. Finally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Finally, I'm not the only one." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like, I know that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when you look at it, you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this looks better, but I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's personal preference. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I just thought that when I
was watching it, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think this deserves to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have like music, voice acting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just enjoyed that more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I was, when I carried
on reading the manga, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought this is good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, I actually wanted it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to just see the animation of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is the guy who
watches Seven Deadly Sins </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> season three, and is just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] No! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what? It's probably
better than the manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's probably better than the manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - See, that's what I'm saying, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Would I rather, what we get
is just like the manga colored </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or would I rather Seven
Deadly Sins, season three? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Get that out of here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They literally made the art 10 times worse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than it is in the manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> At least they just took the
fucking art from the manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, if I had literally grabbed the manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and colored it in and
then played some music </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as you read it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And voice acting. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> If you literally can't animate it, don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you know what I mean? Like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just do the old cell like movements. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey yells) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, it's like fucking, what is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I love the like CircleTunes
animation on YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? Where you just pop, do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Just move it around. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just fucking do that, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Genuinely, I don't know why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know it sounds strange </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I guess I've
just become so detached </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to giving a shit, where
like these people seem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to like fucking seethe
weekly about manga art </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> not being adapted properly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And, it's like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. No. I get that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I get that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, that's obviously
taking it too far. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I know that this
obviously isn't that good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but also at the same time, I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have we not learned that this
is always, this is the norm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, this is what we're getting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I don't think so, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I feel like with
anime art and manga art, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's two totally different mediums, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's, I fell like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It still has to look close enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because I feel like, for example, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm bringing up an another example now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm talking about
Junji Ito adaptations, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you, did you watch the Junji Ito? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Did you watch the Junji Ito, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like the short story adaptation? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember what it was called. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes. Unfortunately I did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. That was literally
just like copying the manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> page panel by panel, by panel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's just- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then, making it underwhelming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then, just making it
completely underwhelming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And, that's just because
the arcs just couldn't be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> transferred over to the big screen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like, it just wasn't enough detail. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm so sad about that anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the art. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I find that with fights, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I find them so much more frustrating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to figure out reading a
manga than in an anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I get that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because there's some
fights where I'm like, wait, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. No. I get that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But the thing is the
Zeus versus Adam fight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the manga is very
easily understandable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. I know. I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know exactly what's happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's basically just two
dudes punching the shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> out of each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> How can you fuck that up? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> How do you not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How do you not know what's going on there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're not talking about
like the Demon Slayer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking room rotating fight, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] No. I know. I know. I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's literally just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're in a fucking stadium, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like, I was like, all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so I read the manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, yep, it's just two dudes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they were literally
just like aura, aura, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> auraing each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, what about this were people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like coming to the manga on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, it's literally just like people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just pumped like fists, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the exact same page over and over again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - People just like
detailed fights in manga- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I appreciate it. I look at it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "That's nice." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But also I just, I just, I want the voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, did you enjoy the anime, then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I had a great time with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, like people
are it's unwatchable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a good show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not unwatchable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so easy to turn your
brain off and enjoy that show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not to the point
where it's unwatchable, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I feel like it took
like a really good manga </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and made it an average show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's how I feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's my honest opinion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I feel like the
manga is kind of average. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You think so? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Reading it I'm like, "You know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> After the first two fights
or every single fight after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think there's three
more fights after that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I predicted who was
going to win immediately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just based off how they entered. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was so obvious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the latest fight
in the manga as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The one that's been finished </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was so obviously that
the guy was going to lose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> from the start that I
was totally uninvested. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just talking about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't read the latest manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I haven't read the
latest chapter either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I haven't read like
the latest fight, so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, what was the last fight
that you saw in the manga? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was a Jack the
Ripper was the one I saw. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I loved that fight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was a great fight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, I knew that Jack the
Ripper was going to win. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It was very obvious he was going to win. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow, spoilers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Spoilers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The next fight after that fight, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think you'll immediately be able to tell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who's going to win within
like the first two chapters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd be lying if I said
that I didn't foresee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> some of the fights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But, that's what I
thought was so good about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's genuinely, everyone's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "It's the art about Adam and
Zeus fight that was the best. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think that was the
best part about Adam and Zeus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Adam and Zeus, I didn't
know until the last moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who was going to win that fight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Right. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's that, and it was just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I loved how the flight just
evolved and progressed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's basically every trope
about like an anime fight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> put into this one fight, but
just like expanded to 10 or 11, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it was just pure, macho fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it, you know, it doesn't
require a lot of thinking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It doesn't require a lot of brain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's what I love
about Records of Ragnorok. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It like, takes out all the bullshit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like we don't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we know you don't care about story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We know you don't give a
about story, here, hit it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let me just give you fights
and fights and fights. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's what I love about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's where I felt
that when everyone was saying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, it's the art, it's the fights." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, I think the really
good thing that it had going, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> especially in the start. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think probably
what made it so appealing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to people is that the fights in the start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I genuinely had no idea
who was going to win. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could not, I didn't have any idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I feel like after
the third fight especially, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought it was so boring. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, I sleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was obvious he was
going to win from the start. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I feel like just the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that that show was just constructed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in general was not meant for
like long form serialization. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause again, it's like, oh cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Here's the 17th fight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, because of the
way that the show did it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the start, it was
like, "Here's two guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> None of them were bad guys. Second fight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Here's two guys. Very strong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> None of them are bad guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Make your own mind up
who you want to root for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Third fight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This guy's the bad guy. Real bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No one likes him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Third guy. Oh, this guy's the good guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, he's real good." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then the good guy wins and
then you're like all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then, the fourth one, it's so obvious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> he's trying to do the old switcheroo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "Oh, he's the bad guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh he's going to, oh we
want him to lose." You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's so obvious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because, he tries to sell
it so hard, sell the show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sorry. I'm very off of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, it's fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like it definitely
got weaker, and I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And, even though I've caught up to it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how much I'm
going to keep reading it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because I feel like I've had enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, yeah, man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really care about keep reading it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I just read it whenever I'm
looking for some dumb, fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Switch my brain off because like what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like the biggest
difference between the manga </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the anime adaptation for me was that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the anime is just missing this intensity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I kind of felt
when reading the manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, I'm pretty sure it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because when you're reading manga, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, because of the
art, you can kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can kind of just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you feel this intensity 'cause like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're filling in the gaps
with your mind. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's how really manga
works for me, at least. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> With anime, you don't, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's presented right in front of you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the movement is there. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's why to me like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine if One Punch Man season one got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the same adaptation as season two. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What part of the big
appeal of One Punch Man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the manga at least is the art
is fucking incredible. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And, I feel like just because you see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the difference between
season one and season two, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just because season two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just feels so much more
flat compared to the manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's just because the story's there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've got the same story, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but just the intensity of the art- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's no impact, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The intensity- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've already, I've
started, even though it was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was a slight disappointing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I still love season
two of One Punch Man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I really enjoyed it. Honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love One Punch Man, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's one of my favorite
manga and shows of all time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I think this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I get that, but like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love the story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know how you
can watch season one- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And being like that
was fucking incredible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then watch a show that
was half as good as one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Season one of Trash Takes, we find out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Connor doesn't have ears. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Season two of Trash Takes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we find out Connor doesn't have eyes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. I'm not saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's just turning into
fucking Helen Keller. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not saying that One Punch Man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> season two is not a downgrade. It is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's still a banger a show though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's still great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, One Punch Man for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> although the action was amazing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like the amazing tiramisu </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> after your five course meal,
you know the animation right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To me, it was always, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was always the story in One Punch Man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, 'cause it seems
like it doesn't have it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then season two, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they introduced Garou. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Garou, Garou, Garou? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garou. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Garou. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. I love that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is such a good, good
aspect in the story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I love how it plays into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then the manga now is amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I fucking love reading the manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think the story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, I mean this is going
to one hot take to another. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> All right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Honestly, I don't think the story- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Shit on one I love, Garnt. Do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just shit on one I love. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Tell me I'm wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think the story of One
Punch Man is like top tier. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's a good story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, if you're going to
talk about story from one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean fucking Mob Psycho 100, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think has a way better
story than One Punch Man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have to agree with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I guess, but Mob
is more of a neater story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everything wraps up
nicely. Everything about- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just feels like it's more of a story, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm not saying One Punch Man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't have a story, obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it has a pretty decent story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would rank Mob higher
than One Punch Man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. By far by far. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Mob, to me is the full package. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Not by far, calm down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is. It is. It is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not by far. Come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mob Psycho is like pretty
much the full package </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on everything you want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's got a great animation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's got a very good story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Very well written characters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like One Punch Man- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - One Punch Man just kind of wrote </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off a gimmick, essentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It kind of like I liked- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, they used it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They turned a gimmick
into a lovable story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They turned a gimmick
into a lovable story, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I feel couldn't sustain itself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. I disagree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the story right now is amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not saying the story
is bad in One Punch Man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Fuck you, Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But, I think Mob Psycho
definitely had a better story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, Mob Psycho is finished. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, One Punch Man's still going. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Scientist's tick check that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Bigger length equals better story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, it means never
admit one piece is good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No. I take that back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. I don't know. I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Although I agree that Mob
Psycho 100 is probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the strongest story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's something about One Punch Man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> season two that really gets me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. It gets me going. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] It just gets you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It gets me going. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It gets me going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just your personal
preference, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're entitled to your wrong opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, for me
season two was, it was okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was okay. It was great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, season two for
me, it was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all right, time to read the manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even in the manga, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like that arc
that season two adapted, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was one of the lesser
exciting parts of the story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like the real good
part of the story is what's- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's literally the arc after. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally the arc after. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's when the story
starts getting interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But, I mean, there's like the issue is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you got to deal with Saitoma </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as, you know, as a story element. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, I feel like he just hasn't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or there hasn't been like the right way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like deal with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because, I feel like the
most interesting part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of One Punch Man, season two
and season three is Garou. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, I feel like that was the element </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that he added to try to save that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But, Saitama's still still there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's only so much you
can play off that as a concept. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Season three? Is that just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sorry. I'm saying if
season three did get adapted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We haven't heard anything
about that. Have we? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It got, did it get announced? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I don't think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did Mob Psycho season
three get announced? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think there's
enough for season three. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is there? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's from what I understand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's not that much left of mob psycho. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dunno. I didn't finish Mob Psycho. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What, how does he know finish it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause he's the anime man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause, I just had not enough time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I was reading other things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Brah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Brah. It's so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I was reading
what is probably going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to be anime of the year, AKA Chainsawman. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh God. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That trailer dropped and it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like 10 million views on Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my gosh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if we're going to talk about a trailer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that made me nut, that's a
trailer that made me nut. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That trailer definitely like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they knew what they were doing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I was like, "MAPPA,
you son of a bitch." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You son of a bitch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You did it again." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You son of a bitch,
MAPPA, you did it again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. So what MAPPA were
doing Attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And, they saw all those comments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that people were like, "Oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why couldn't they animate
Attack on Titan like this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What's going on?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, Do you remember
the first Attack on Titan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> season four trailer? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It looked fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, like compared to the final product- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I'm scared of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I'm scared of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. That's what everybody's scared of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We also learned from like,
when Ken came on the podcast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shout out to that episode,
he was telling us, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not really about the studio. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's about the guy in
charge and who he brings on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It's about the director
and the team of animators. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, you know, if you
have good connections </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you can bring someone on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I almost feel like the studio </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> almost doesn't matter, sometimes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a slight indication, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I feel like it's so inconsistent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. Absolutely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, it's definitely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of it has got to do
with the team behind it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and director behind it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, we just talked
about Jujutsu Kaisen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> also by MAPPA, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but that was like such
a well animated show, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even compared to like other MAPPA shows. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's just mostly
because of the team behind it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And, I'm hoping that Chainsaw
Man gets a good adaptation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't even read the fucking manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I re-read the manga
when the trailer dropped. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You now when you have those, those shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or those, you know, properties. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what you
call them, (mumbles). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - IPs? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - IPs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - IPs where you just know
they're going to be bangers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so you don't,
you're not like in a rush </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to jump into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, I know I've
got something coming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've got a little present
under the Christmas tree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can unwrap it anytime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know it's there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You need like a 10 out of 10
in the waiting, just in case. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that's definitely mine right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I know it's coming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm waiting for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just praying. I'm just going, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm also honestly- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's airing in the Fall, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Chainsawman? Is that this year? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's either this year
or early next year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck, if it's this year, Jesus like it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this year doesn't need another good anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My fucking God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's getting too much, now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's too much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's too much to watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] I know. I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've not watched that much anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just kind of watch it
if it's on Netflix now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've become so normy that like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really want to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just don't want to have to deal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like shitty websites, now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It really takes me out of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. I feel that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I've watched like
the first episode of Trese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Fillipino one.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was pretty good. It was pretty good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would need to watch more of it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it seemed pretty good so far. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's Trese about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the one that's set in Manila </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the Philippines. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Trese, it's basically, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think of if Ghosts in
the Shell and Blood Sea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had a baby and it was
born in the Philippines. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what that show is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ghost hunter show kind of thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ghost hunter, like monster hunter show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's pretty badass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I really enjoyed
everything I saw from it so far. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You should watch it and
actually form an opinion on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. The weird thing
about Netflix anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or Netflix shows is that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you just browse on Netflix
and there's this show, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you've just never heard of before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're like, has
anyone talks about this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. Like, no, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've literally seen no exposure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for this one show and you
just end up putting it on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like, oh,
that was pretty decent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, that's how I
felt about Castlevania. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Oh, Castlevania. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When that first came out,
I was like, oh, what is this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I never saw even Netflix
promoting the show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, oh, I'll give it a go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I liked the games. And I watched it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I heard they might be producing
a spinoff or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. 'Cause apparently
the main, that story's over, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they might be doing a spinoff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I really want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I want more sexy voice acting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So good. Watch CastlevaniaiIf
you haven't already. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The only anime I've
been watching recently, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which I highly recommend is a Odd Taxi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I've been meaning to watch that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I've been meaning to watch that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's just something that's
just gone under the radar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And it is probably like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think maybe my anime of the season. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ooh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's tough. It really,
really was a sleeper hit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can tell you what's
not anime of the season </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking Wonder Egg Priority. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - God. I was so sad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We'll get on to that, but yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, okay, so from Odd
Taxi, I don't know anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but I've also been told that
you don't want to know anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it spoils it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - From what everyone's told me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's probably why it's having </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a hard time getting promoted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have to go into it blind right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because, if you tell
people what it's about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it sounds like one of those shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that kind of gets ruined a bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like all spoiled if you tell
them even anything about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kind of. It's more so like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's kind of hard to
tell you what it is about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's about a lot of things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I assume it's about Taxis. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kind of, like the biggest thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the reason it's called Odd Taxi is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the main character
is a taxi driver, I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I guess like the hardest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or the easiest way to describe it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's kind of like a
Tarantino movie or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something along those lines, where- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it like Taxi Driver,
the Scorsese film? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You said that to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, I'm pretty sure I know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what's going to happen in this thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just off that description alone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where I'm like, "Oh, I
bet there's going to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a bunch of people
who come in the taxi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and they seem all unrelated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then we find out that
everything is all related </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and tied together in a neat story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Right. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I bet that's what it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. That's exactly what it's like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tarantino. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I mean, but I mean, that's the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like the easiest
way you can describe it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it is kind of
like a Tarantino movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And what I love about Odd Taxi is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's been so long since
I've just seen an anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that has just set up its premise, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> told it's story and then
just wrapped everything up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in a neat little package. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, the part of the
reason I think it like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> blew up a lot in like the past week is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just 'cause it's ending was
just really fucking good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It tied everything up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's finished now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It's finished now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How many episodes? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's 13 episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you just, you watch this anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's 13 episodes and that's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everything's tied up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a really, really good ending that- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How do we milk it for more? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If it's good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How do we merchandise it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt, think about these things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've got to have an anime
that has a clean ending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It's just clean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just a clean anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm going to watch. I'm sold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's been so long
since I've seen an anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's just got a really tight script </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to where it sets up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything it needs to set up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - A race. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It gives you the right. Yeah. Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Exactly, just like a race. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It gives you- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just like it. Just like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It gives you the right climax </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for everything that is set up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it just ends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, I'm just like. Damn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's just everything I need in the show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I love about
watching TV shows, and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Damn. All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's been so long
since I've seen a TV show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just end like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, I got to watch Boys, Odd Taxi, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was about to say Erased. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not erased. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Invincible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Invincible. That's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So many to watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And apparently I didn't
watch Wonder Egg Priority, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but I heard that it was a mess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I watched up to episode 10, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I'm only- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You should probably
just stop where you're at. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I loved what I saw. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You should probably stop
where you're at, 'cause. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. So, what the fuck happened? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Basically, well, for starters, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well, I don't want to give too much away, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but basically half of the
OVA is a fucking recap, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which already was like a red flag to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, we don't need a recap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't do that here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We don't do that here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why do you need a recap in an ending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You asked me, man, you fucking asked me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait a minute, in the 20 minute episode? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] 40. It was 40. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it was 40,
45, something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. So it was- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was two episodes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - About 15 minutes of it was a recap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a really long recap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> At least it felt like a long time to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, when they get too
comfortable with recapping shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, something's going wrong, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like, "Oh, getting
a little too comfortable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with those recaps over there, huh, anime?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then, they just added
like three new elements </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the story that just was
introduced, but never resolved. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So we're like, wait, wait. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you literally just added this element, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 20 minutes before the
ending, and then that's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, when people
like love a show so much, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't wanna admit that it's wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I bet there's people on Twitter that like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I bet those people on
Twitter that were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Now, now guys, hold on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They might be onto something here." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Please, please do something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fix what you've done, please. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it was just like,
and I just felt so shitty, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like, again, like the first season </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I watched it, it was amazing. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you've watched up until episode 10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fucking amazing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I couldn't wait for it to be concluded. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. And, unfortunately, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it wasn't even concluded
with the final episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It just left more questions than answers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And, everyone was just like, "Cool." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So wait, so wait. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When they didn't conclude it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did they leave room for a season two? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Or was that just a, "Well, fuck you guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is how it ends." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think they tried to
do like a really like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> open-ended like Madoka-esque ending, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> except unlike the Madoka
ending, nothing was explained. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, like you couldn't even
form a theories about what, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was anything there, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> At least the Madoka ending,
it was kind of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all right, we can kind of figure out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucks your wife. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Leaves. Chat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, we can kind of figure out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why it ended like this. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a lot of it is like
very like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a metaphorical and everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we can kind of figure out
theories of what this might mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But with Wonder, they kind of did that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but they were like no clues for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Figure it out. Bye. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, you like the show? Fuck you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It literally was just like, it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it felt like CloverWorks was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, I give up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck it. End it. Roll the credits." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Didn't CloverWorks also
adapt Promised Neverland? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Promised Neverland season two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ooh. Ooh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they've been on not a
great streak, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is such a shame, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because they always start
off so strong. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Promised Neverland
started off really strong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Wonder Egg started off really strong, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and none of them have been
able to stick the landing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone's gonna, anytime
they get anything now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's going good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone's going to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Guys, don't get excited. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just wait. Just wait." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just wait, just wait, just wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just wait until the ending happens. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I was so disappointed
when I heard that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I was actually, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I watched up to episode 10 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I really, really was enjoying it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But then I remember thinking, I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Ah, it's still setting a plot points </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and still exploring
characters, 10 episodes in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's got to end in three episodes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's not a lot of time there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It definitely was built. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel for a 24 episode,
like a two core series, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but I feel like they just
weren't given the opportunity to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just also can't believe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what they did to Promised
Neverland season two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, if you don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Promised Neverland was an amazing show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One of the best selling manga, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like the top five, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was four, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It sold more than My Hero Academia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It's like the fourth
top five best selling manga </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of all time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The first season was amazing
if you haven't watched it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The manga is fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then, instead of just
like doing what they were doing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like, "Now, hold on guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What if we just do something else?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, they were literally like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right. So we just
finished the current arc, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how many chapters do we have left? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like 150? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> How many episodes do we have left? Three. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Skip about 120 episodes and
just go straight to the end." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. That's- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's literally what they did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They fucked the show up completely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then, the final
episode was literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a PowerPoint presentation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then, and you know
how it is, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like when you
get a bad adaptation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a cool-down period where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's not a set rule, but
it's like a societal rule </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where you can't make a remake
now within the next 10 years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, it's 10 years now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're not going to get a
good Promised Neverland. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Adaptation until someone is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Wow, dust this off." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean look at this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, they tried to
recover with the live action. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But, that was also horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a live action? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was Korean though. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. It was Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was Japanese? I saw the poster. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It looked like a porno film. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I dunno why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It didn't look good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think the most live
action anime adaptations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> do look like a porno film. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think porno parodies actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of look better, sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Japanese like movie posters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> also look like Japanese porn posters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the same production quality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They literally, it's really bizarre. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I've seen like AX cosplay shoots </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that look better than
some of these posters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, it's wild seeing like just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how they look sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I remember the Full Metal Alchemist, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like live action one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still haven't seen that movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I fucking refuse to,
because I saw the trailer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, if someone
with like, like 500 subs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> uploaded this as like a
April Fool's parody movie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would believe it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it was that bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> The costumes were horrible looking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like fucking Ed would
look like a crack addict. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like with his like hair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like all over the place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, no, don't do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would you massacre my boy like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It looked so bad? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't get over how they
all look like porn videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They actually do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dead ass, I've seen
some like porn parodies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of anime that looked better than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some live action animated films. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just had this thought the other day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, you know, put on a JAV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, how come I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just casually? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just casually post some JAV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was on the train, put some JAV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought, huh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How come I've never seen one above 640 P? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Never. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never seen a JAV. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's just cause they
go straight to DVD. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probably. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The motherfuckers ain't
got 1080P lying around? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I just thought
about it and I'm like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's because the ones that are 1080P </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are hidden behind a paywall. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But, surely someone's
pirating them. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh yeah. Of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was sitting there and I'm
like these, these posters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like movie posters,
amazing immaculate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> immaculate posters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And every single time,
I'm fighting for my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to find 720P. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll be lucky if I can find it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, I thought what's up with that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Why is it only? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Maybe- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I cannot tell, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even have an inkling
of what, what year JAVs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know for those
of you who don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> JAV is the Japanese porn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have no idea what year these were made. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't even have an idea
of when they were made. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, you go on the American porn, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they're in fucking 8K. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> What's going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What's going on Japan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think anyone's looking for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like eight K pixelation of dick, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's still pixelate
at the end of the day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not that I need it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just think the technology
is available. You know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know they can get these cameras. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why aren't they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or, maybe what it is is that
the actual JAV is in like 4k, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then it's the piraters who are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll just download the HD version. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I refuse to believe there's not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for some reason I've never seen it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Have you ever seen it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never seen it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What, 1080P JAV? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I've seen it again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Again, it's hidden behind a pay wall. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like tell me your sources. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That was just a thought
I was thinking, sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because we got off, we were
talking about the movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I'm sure it's out there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somewhere deep down in the web, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like, can I be bothered
to look for it? No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. That's me too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna spend
more than five minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] No.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Speaking of things I've been watching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay.
- Yeah? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not a TV show
or a movie or an anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ooh. Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was watching a particular livestream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know where we're
going and we shouldn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Women always say men
don't have feelings. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, I definitely had feelings </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when I was watching a Coco's
Graduation livestream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, that was fucking insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was nuts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I saw like on the news that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it was like,
oh, like internet news. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, not the TV news. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I saw on the internet news that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that ended up being, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's the seventh highest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> livestream of all time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Livestream of all time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I saw that as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> She, I think she capped at 480,000 people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> watching her live, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. During the concert
bit, she was like 480,000. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was kind of wondering if
he was going to break 500K. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, come on, you can do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Half a mil. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can do it, simps. Come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I believe in you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was nuts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because I was watching that live </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's some parts, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the chat was going so fast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it wasn't literally
lagging the stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I saw. I saw. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It was crazy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just occasionally popping in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just seeing what was going on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I didn't care much about like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the whole like idle side of things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I've never really
cared about the whole, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whole live idle side of things
or whatever, but like yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there were parts where I was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting a little emotional here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, honestly, same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I couldn't watch it live, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we were doing
something at the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - but I watched like the
recording afterwards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And honestly it was like, I'm, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as I've said of what
I watched less VTubers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now than I did last year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But man, it was getting
emotional at some points. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Holy Shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I honestly think
this is an end of an era </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for Hololive because I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Hololive owes cocoa so fucking much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Absolutely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because she is basically the sole reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why hololive is as big internationally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She's basically the reason
why Hololive English exists. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I feel like to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like the end of an era for Hololive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she's done so much for the company </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and now she's just not there anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like she did move
out of her own accord, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is happy that no big, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like controversy happened
to make her move. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's fully respectable
that she was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "I kind of just don't
want to be hear anymore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for whatever reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> See you later," kind of thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which would just made it
even more bitter sweet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I'm happy that
she made the decision </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to move on and do whatever
she wants to do now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But, you know, it is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And she went out with a fucking bang. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Holy Shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I saw those super chats, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to think about how much money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she made from that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you're not enjoying
it, go out on top, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then also, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean she clearly enjoys
doing other stuff on the side. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, why not, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you can bring a massive
audience over with you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, if you do a show like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like people of course go check
out what you're doing next. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So it was a brilliant idea as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I mean, I think honestly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Coco in terms of just like looking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at each talent and as content creators, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I do think she is genuinely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of the most talented content creators </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Hololive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And, that's just, and
I mean, if she wasn't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then she wouldn't have had the success </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that she did internationally, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Can I say massive brain
idea that she prerecorded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like the interview sections and
put English subtitles on it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, that is so gigabrain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I was like, wait, how are they? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> How are they subtitling that fast? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like whoa is that just like a track? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This subtitler is a mad man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. The JoJo event
panel people are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "How are they doing this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> This is impossible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At first, I just thought that I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some fucking light speed translator </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but I go, (Garnt makes computer sound) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, "I've got
this boys. I got this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I was like that's so gigabrain, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because she clearly knows
how like Eric and her </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> international fan base was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as big as a Japanese fan base. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's like why not get both of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in at the same time? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So gigabrain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I feel like that's
why the live stream was partly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> how it broke so many records. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just because it wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just the Japanese audience watching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it, wasn't only just gonna be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a Japanese audience watching it anyway, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there was always going to
be a big part of the audience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They just didn't get what was going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, I was like, should I cry now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it always- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, am I crying now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Am I crying? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are you crying? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it the goodbye time? No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right now? Right now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right now it's oh. Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Thanks to the subtitles, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone can get involved in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, it was just like a fivehead move. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Absolutely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. And, it's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's sad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What did you think of it Connor? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't really watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I was watching it occasionally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Wow, this is pretty cool." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It was all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, again, like
I've mentioned before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't really like, I'm
not like a massive simp </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of any of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if that's a derogatory term. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Banned on Twitch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't particularly
like watch a lot of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I know people are like,
"Well, you collab with them." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. It's different though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I, you know, to me
it was like, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, it was cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it was an epic show from what I saw. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Epic, sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't say that word
without being sarcastic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Epic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was clearly just
an amazing production. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Props to the team. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, if you're going to go out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why not fucking do it like that? You know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Fucking out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause it's like, I feel like, wait, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what was I going to say again? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like they did
really put on a good show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was going out with a bang. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And, if there was a way that
she was going to go out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this was the best way to go out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I completely agree with her creatively. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And, I hope the best for
her future endeavors, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I would choose the same thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would choose to go with a bang </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rather than just like fizzle out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fizzle out. Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Absolutely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially if you're not
happy with what you're doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? If it's inevitable
that it's going to happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So yeah, it was the right move, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just really now
puts into perspective. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like who who's the
next one that's going to go? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If there is going to be
another one that's going to go- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's an interesting thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I feel that because
it was so new and so fresh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the idea of people are gonna leave. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so odd. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I guess they, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't always repeat
it with people joining. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's going to get to a point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where there's going to be as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> many people leaving as it was joining. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There has to be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the thing. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, I do wonder </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause Coco was the first Hololive talent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to leave Hololive on
her own accord, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I'm just thinking like, I'm sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess of we know, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. That we know of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That we know of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like, I'm sure like her announcing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that she was going to leave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably planted in some
of other talent's heads </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had to be like, "Oh,-" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can leave? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can just quit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well yeah, I think, the
most interesting thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for me personally about VTubers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like the politics of it all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It seems like there
is like a lot of rules. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially on the JP side </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's just really
entertaining watching it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because everyone's like,
"No, you can't turn left. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have to turn right." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, and everyone's
like freaking out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's really, I don't know- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like thousands of
people back seating you, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's very fun watching
this kind of stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, and the rules
and all the politics. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's very, it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like people turn anime
into a Game of Thrones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes, these Vtubers
and it's heller exciting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I love watching it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like a spectator, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In that sense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think that this, yeah,
this does ask the question of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is this going to be a normal thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How will it be dealt with? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What impact will this have
on VTubing as a whole? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Who knows? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to be watching on the sidelines </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having a great time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because recently there's been a couple </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like bigger Nijisanji VTubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as well that are like
left on their own accord. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's like, I feel
it's like slowly starting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to become a thing of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just especially the bigger creators </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of realizing that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, if I stay in, you know,
this kind of like agency, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then I'm kind of limited
to what I can do." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You are. You can only
be a Vtuber, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, it's only up until
they get to a certain point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they realize like,
"Oh, if I just leave, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I have so many more
opportunities that I can try out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for myself without
being like, restricted." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the question, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a Catch 22. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I feel like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without saying anything too
private, like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like Coco was one of the few </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who had established yourself
like outside, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like, especially
with how big she is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she can do whatever the
hell she wants, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And be able to establish herself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, I feel like with, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially with some Hololive VTubers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're only known for
being Hololive VTubers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sure. Sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like a catch 22 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they could leave
whenever they want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, if they leave, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what would they be saying goodbye to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, they'd basically
have to like build themselves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up from the ground up again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And with the VTubing
scene being how it is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they can't really build up their other, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> any other kind of thing that
they do outside of Hololive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? Because that's the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They kind of just be
like typecasted, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the secrecy behind the Vtubing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there is a reason for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But, at the same time,
if there is a VTuber, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who does want to talk
about their other lives </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> then they just can't with
the platform they have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And, they're just-
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Going to be known </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as this Hololive VTuber </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rather than anything else they
may potentially want to be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sure. Sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is why, if I think
if we saw someone leave </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a Vtuber Agency to become another VTuber, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd feel like that's like the wrong idea, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the whole point
is to expand, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And do something else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Otherwise, why did you leave? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just made it harder
on yourself. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. Right. And also like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously Hololive is big
and there's, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's other agencies and this is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, God, there's fucking so many now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What I find it interesting now
as a content creator is that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, in YouTube and Twitch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like, there's hierarchies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right, of like your size. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? And like with
YouTube and Twitch where you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're kind of on your own, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you kind of just do your own thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You do what you want. If
you're with an agency, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's kind of expectations
of you to perform </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or do anything. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so, you know, when
you start bringing in talent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you keep bringing in talent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what happens when you have too much, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> too many people and the
market is oversaturated, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's partially your agency. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So what if you have too many VTubers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and maybe y'all some of the
Vtubers aren't doing too well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> struggling a little bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How do you handle that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, what do you do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you like, just leave it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] You just, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause that's where I'm
like interested in seeing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how they handle that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause that'll really show
what their mindset is- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - On how to handle situations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well because, I think
currently Hololive now has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like less than 30, no, around 30 I'd say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of all? No. There's
more than that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Actually if you include EN and IN and IDN </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a whole list- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, there's a whole list
of languages in the future. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's say, yeah okay, let's guess like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably around like
less than 50, I reckon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is still a lot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then you have agencies like Nijisanji </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that have literally hundreds of VTubers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, you know, do you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're an agency where
you're like, okay, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if we want to keep bringing in new talent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we've got to hire more staff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We can't afford to, to it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause not everyone's
pulling in the same numbers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not everyone can be the
number one, obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you start cutting off talent? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> If so, how does that look publicly? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. I mean, I feel like
that's a lose, lose, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you can't just cut off
talent because no matter what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you cut talent off the fact, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their fan base is gonna
fucking make a lot of noise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you don't come
out looking good at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I guess, I dunno,
it's, it's interesting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't think- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's just so many problems, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and the challenges that
I think will arise, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because we haven't seen them yet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's been so new. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think down the line, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're gonna be coming into these things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just interested to see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> how the fan bases will handle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all these things coming up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they're going
to happen at some point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sure. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, right now
with the VTubing scene, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's kind of like the wild west. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. It is. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it's the new thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's just starting
to establish itself now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's, it's only
getting, it's only getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the point now where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, we, we had the
massive explosion in 2020, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and now we're kind of seeing
what the YouTube scene, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> VTubing scene, sorry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is going to be really
like in 2021 and above </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you know, right now Coco leaving, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a massive creator on the platform. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And arguably she, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the longest time, she
was the face of Hololive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially like early 2020, she was- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Internationally especially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Internationally, she was the face. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And now it's kind of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's becoming a new kind of scene now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, it's interesting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's going to be interesting
to see how the scene develops. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's just so many
interesting things that are, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that happen and challenges
that will come up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in that kind of a space </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as opposed to normal YouTubing and Twitch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That, I just, cause
we live this job, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I'm just fascinated
by how a company would deal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or how it would tackle
some of those challenges. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's going to be interesting to see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who they'll sideline, right? Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I don't know. That's
what I find most interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about it. - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just love seeing the scene. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's such an interest, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this is the first time
we've probably God knows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when we can see this again,
where a whole kind of genre </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has just popped up- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Very quickly and explodes
and is very self-contained </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because normally everything's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it self-contained? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's the most
self-contained we've seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> out of any genre on online. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I think Hololive
is obviously definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very self-contained by,
you know, by design, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I feel like VTubing as
a whole is now kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> especially with the amount of VTubers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that have popped up on Twitch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and every other streaming platform. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Now, it's not so much, but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess it was interesting at the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think, it's everyone's
just doing everything now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's still
self-contained in a sense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like, yeah, you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot more like individual
VTubers now doing things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with other individual
VTubers and you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Vtubers, and agencies and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But at the end of the day, if you yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> also aren't a Vtuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's very difficult to do anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with those kinds of people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> More difficult than I'd say, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like if I wanted to collab
with like another YouTuber. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's just a humor thing, really. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you have the same
kind of content-ish aimed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> at the same audience kind of
thing, it's doable, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like VTubing is just
obviously the trends now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I feel like if
anything, if you're just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you want to start off
streaming or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or just you're a new content creator, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then just by being a VTuber, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're more likely to get
noticed than just by like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being a normal on-camera streamer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sure. Sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Unfortunately, I don't know why that is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It just is now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - People like anime, Bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's just how it is, isn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. People just want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to see anime girls and boys, apparently. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They just hate the real people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is there a big male Vtuber? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think we've seen
any big one, though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Actually the, the biggest
Vtuber in Nigisangi is a guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. There's this guy called Kuzuha </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who I think has like almost 900K subs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh shit. Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. And he was really
interesting as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because he was actually
scouted by Nijisanji, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because he was originally
an individual Vtuber. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who gained so much of a
massive and dedicated fan base </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that he got picked up by Nijisanji. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, now he's the
biggest Nijisanji streamer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And, he's essentially the
biggest male streamer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wonder why I'm never getting
recommended clips of him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause he's very Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I get recommended
Japanese clips all the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I don't watch this, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - stop shoving the bandwidth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, he's really fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I watched a couple of his streams, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he's super fun to watch, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's just really
interesting how he managed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to stand on top of a very female oriented </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like agency, right?. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah, because that is interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think we in English, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think there's a big male VTuber. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is weird to think because most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the big streamers are male. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, streaming is like right now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> at least the male
dominated market where you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you got like Valkyrae and Pokimane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up there in the top 10. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But, everyone else I think is male. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] It's messed up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like with VTubers pretty much, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think 90% of the big VTubers are female. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Right now, at least. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, definitely. I mean- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wonder why do you think that is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, just throwing ideas out there. Like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wifus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I think literally wifus. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - People want to watch
cute girls than cute boys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's just how it is. Unfortunately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You think so? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like it's too easy
to say that that's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's gotta be a reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe, I've never like I've watched. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because sometimes I'll
just click the Vtuber tag </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on Twitch and I'll browse through, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know, and I haven't
really seen many guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in there that I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah, it's not like super
naturally entertaining. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. It's tough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because what makes this might be getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into a different topic, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but what does make a popular streamer? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe, you know, maybe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. It's tough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like, what is the
audience for male streamers? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is it still mostly males or- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. I feel I
don't know if Twitch tells me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It depends on the contents, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have a pretty healthy
balance, I think. Both. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you even look that up on Twitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck if I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, you probably can. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know you can on YouTube, but like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, you can? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll check later and we'll
put it on the screen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it is weird now
that I think about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> why there are so few
big, bigger male Vtubers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to the females. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't want to say like the meme, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but is it, is it maybe the fact
that if you're a, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you would just be a normal male streamer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you were good at it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is there benefits to
being a VTuber as a male </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over just doing, showing
your face if you can? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's really strange, because like, I feel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel actually like internationally, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this idea of like VTubers
has very much been created </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and established through
Hololive where like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to realize that
Hololive is actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the weirder one because they're
more of like an idol agency. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whereas like Nijisanji
VTubers and like Vshojo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or like even like the
individual VTubers, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're not idols. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They're just streamers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wonder if it's the case of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people like, this is gonna to sound bad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think this is true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think guys want to watch a guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who they think is their bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They think it's that mate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They feel like they can
joke with, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's and their humor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, I think that guys
want to watch girls, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're the ideal of their
girl that they want to watch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You think almost, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I agree with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I think that works
perfectly with Vtubing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you can give the
character, you want to play it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you can also put a nice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> healthy injection of personality. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wonder if that doesn't
quite work with guys, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but then again, I guess that's
the question of what's the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're a male, Vtuber,
watch your target demo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you trying to be the sexy VTuber? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I've seen those guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who are trying to be the sexy Vtuber, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I cringe internally, and a lot- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] 'cause I think- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They do their voice like "Yeah. Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm a male Vtuber." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. 'Cause I feel like with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of male VTubers I've seen- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm going to get shit for doing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. I've got, I think
that's a legit point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I think like with a
lot of male VTubers I see. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And, it's kind of like they
trying to take the Hololive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of a model and flip it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and gender it and gender flip it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Except I don't think it works at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. And I think at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of male streamers
that are big have like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> an equal amount of male to female viewers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if not, maybe more so male. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is really interesting. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because again, when I
was looking up on Kuzuha, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the top streamer for Nijisanji. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> His audience is 95% like female. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That makes sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] But, it's really weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also in Japan that is normally like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they're very much more
willing to buy into that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, what's really weird
is that his personality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> does not match that demographic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - His personality is a
little more like gruff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just like straight to the point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> He's really like foul mouthed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, that's popular in Japan, though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know that as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is popular in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But, like you would think
that the standard formula </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to get a female audience, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is like, as you said,
like the very like, ah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like type of guys. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But then I don't think that is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think when you try to
be sexy, you're not sexy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And also, you know- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially when you're an avatar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what for me,
maybe because I'm older. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I see a guy who's
using an anime avatar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he's doing this like edging voice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where like, (Connor breathes deeply) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, bro, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like literally just
imagine a guy in his room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in front of like a Dell
monitor going, "Oh yeah. Oh." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In front of his poor Yeti. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It's like, to me,
it's like, I don't want that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not shitting on anybody, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not saying they are out there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I have seen some that have done it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, Oh, for fuck's sake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Nah, I know what they're doing. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think there just hasn't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's hard because I think if
you're the type of personality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that would need to kill it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as a male VTuber is
also the kind of person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who wouldn't give a fuck
about showing their face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> At least I think so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like if anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> unlike being a female VTuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but being a male VTuber
actually makes it harder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for you to get noticed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah. Definitely. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, which I've never
really thought until now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's hard, because I'm
sure there's gonna be tons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of male VTubers out there who are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "You are totally wrong," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's like, well I think we come from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a perspective of just
general entertainment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and YouTube and then live streaming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we have these kind of, I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we've been doing this
for a very long time- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and we have kind of, we know what kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of personalities work in certain areas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I'm not thinking about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like when you're in the community, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're almost to regurgitative
of ideas around you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, you kind of see, you
copy everything around you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that's what people do. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't do, you don't
try and stand out, but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's tough because I love- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] It's fascinating. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It's so interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause that's the thing is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like no one's
really figured it out yet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in English at least. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure someone's going
to come and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "No, well what about this guy?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, if they had done it- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We don't know every Vtuber. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - If they'd of done it, if
they've killed it really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they'll probably be high up. You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If they're not right
now, they will be soon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll eat my words. You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The fact that we can't immediately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> say a name is I think telling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like super big. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know I'm talking about like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because I obviously
do know male Vtubers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah. Same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But none of them are pulling
in like the numbers close to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, none of them are
pulling in the numbers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that female Vtubers are or anywhere close </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from what I've seen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] No. No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean all the big
agencies, all the big groups, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the main focus is the female VTubers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like the male VTubers, there are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for example Holo Stars, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that always seems like tacked on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Holo Stars doesn't really pull </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in that much compared to the girls. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It really doesn't. It really doesn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. It really
doesn't, unfortunately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for whatever reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel it's because again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that's on Hololive and
not promoting Holo Stars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as much as Hololive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I also just think that
like they don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, it's so difficult. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it is genuinely very difficult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get the right personalities. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's also difficult
to like really nail down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a target demographic, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially if you're a guy like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you do have so many avenues, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unlike a lot of female Vtubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like you'll target
demographic is very obvious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I also want to
say that I don't, I'm not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're not trying to sit here and argue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's easy to be a female Vtuber. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think the right
personality has like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of figured it out yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's the same, but
it's, you know, it's just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I think the important thing is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can't just take what works </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for a female VTuber, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but put it in the male avatar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 100%. 100%. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, expect it to
produce the same results. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it is a very different field </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there is a discussion there about why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, it's the same with
female streamers as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a reason I think that, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of the top streamers
right now are males. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, that's just the
way things are right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think it's kind of
the reverse for VTubers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Never really thought about it until now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It's fascinating. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> This is what, the stuff that I wake up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in middle of the night
thinking about. You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - In a cold sweat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, this is why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is why, like again,
like I don't really watch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not like an avid watcher of anyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just kind of like watch
channels here and there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and watch like, I'll go on Twitch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've watched a lot of
the small VTubers on Twitch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll just flick between them
at night, watch five minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All Right. I've seen enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Watch five minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right. I've seen enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just kind of like seeing what
everyone's doing, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just trying to find
something out there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's really interesting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And again, I think
because the scene is so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so young right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's got all of these
really interesting problems </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like haven't been figured out yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas YouTube and Twitch
had been gamified to death. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like we can probably tell you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's going to be good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and who isn't and who's gonna
be able to figure stuff out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's, again, it's super interesting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, I find it so fascinating, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I love, since I'm obsessed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with YouTube obsessed with Twitch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love everything about content creation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the fact that I get to experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something brand new kind
of pop up and get to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watch it unfold is like the
most fun I've had in forever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I just like YouTube man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. That's why I've
just been really enjoying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like kind of watching around
all these different kinds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of Vtubers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. It's fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just, 'cause, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the longest time I always just thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> VTubing equals Hololive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When, now I know that is
completely not the case. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's so many variants out there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that are just completely
different to a Hololive story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. When I find a
guy who I think is small </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and is about to blow
up and kill it, VTuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll write it down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll let you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll be like I told you so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Promote it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, right now, I don't
think there's anyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who's kind of got the right formula </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's going to take off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Everyone's still
trying to figure out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> their own thing right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think so. I think
everyone's kind of scrambling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Just going to see what's going to work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I feel like
the male VTubing scenes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were waiting for
that first big creator </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that everyone's going to follow, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it only takes one, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. The Ninja of Male Vtubers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I've not seeing enough movement. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause like Hololive figured out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the perfect formula for female
VTubers and everyone like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now that they're like, write that down, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> do it again and in the more languages. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then it worked and now
VTubing's massive for females. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I feel like it's going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to take that first massive male creator </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on the same level as Hololive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like other big female creators, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's going to be like, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is what works,
everyone copy this guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's how it always is, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] That's how it always is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is what works. Copy it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then again, that's why I feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not really going anywhere right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just because everyone's
just copying everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who isn't seeing massive success. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So, it's interesting. Again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's that meme of like
the artists are giving $50 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the same artist just
going around in circles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I mean, that's what Twitch is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's iterating on
each other and copying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's how it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, that's how it's always kind of been. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's always one person who's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> how about I don't that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Someone always has that one idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that just changes the system. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then, eventually
that original person will </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just set a trend and then that
trend will become the norm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then you build on that trend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you keep building on that trend. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then, the new system is created. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It's just like
the clickbait law, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, clickbait evolves on YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because then there's this
like anti-clickbait meta </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I always see pop up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that eventually becomes
the clickbait itself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] True, true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I remember like ages
ago before, like before, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like ProZD popularized the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, I don't give a
shit about clickbait," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just going to be my face, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just like a very basic title. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - With like no caps or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then that just became, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that became a whole
genre in and of itself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because a video with no clickbait </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and a shit ton of views is clickbait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because, you're curious,
how did this get viewed? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This has to something's
going on here, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you saw like, you know, like a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that had one of those like
Indian Facebook posts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> levels of editing that
had like 10 million views, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd click on that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because you're like, how the fuck does </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this have 10 million views? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then they have the top place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That reminds me of the
shit you were showing me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like last Thursday. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was sharing Garnt,
have you seen Dhar Mann? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was showing Garnt Dhar Mann, and also- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my fucking God. What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't get it. I don't get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How has this got so many views? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Garnt isn't into the YouTube desire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So there's a channel called Dhar Mann. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't even know how to
describe it. What is he? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He does these and he, I swear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so popular now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone knows about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He does these videos where
it's basically like a message, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like motivational speech, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - There'll be one where it's
like gold digger gets exposed- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or actor quits, because
he got hate comment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Basically be like, alright, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this guy gets a hate comment online. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then Dhar Mann comes in with a piece </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of motivational advice
that flips it on its head </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the bullies feel like shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the guy who was being bullied, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gets a Lamborghini, succeeds in life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's always that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the most stereotypical, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> man gets bullied or
someone does bad thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Gets the comeuppance for the bad thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the person who got
did wrong gets done right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's always how it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, his videos just
hit in like the perfect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's literally Facebook videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not the perfect, I mean
it is Facebook videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's even, it hits
that uncanny valley, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where it's just so weird to watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of these videos and just think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the most like bare bones message </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can present in the video. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the way, the way I,
the way I thought of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching these videos
that were getting like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tens of millions of views, by the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's, like a R slash
that rarely happens post- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In every video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because every video ends with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then everyone claps. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, that's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What was the dude again
on Facebook Prince Ea? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Prince Ea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Prince Ea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like he kind of did like a similar thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing where he'd do like
these like beat poetry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like too deep for you like life lessons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, I'm just like,
no one lives like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then he did like
videos where he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> depression is just
sadness. Stop being sad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He did like videos like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. He was like, depression
is like this TV remote. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It comes. Then it goes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It comes, then it goes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You should turn it off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just terrible. And then
yeah and I showed Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Yeah, this guy gets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 30 million views a
video and he uploads daily. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which like respect to
him and his production crew </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the videos are
like a very well shot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. They're very well presented. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It should be because he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> probably making $50 million a year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, rather low. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and you got like
different, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you've got so many different actors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> playing these parts as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you've got like a proper crew </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pumping these videos out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And, I just think like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because there's so like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's so few times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I watch a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I watch a trend on YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, "I don't get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't get it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, how is this doing this well? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because sometimes you see
a video and you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, this isn't my type of content, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I can see why it's doing well." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then, Connor shows me this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like the hottest trend right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> getting fucking blowing
everyone out in terms of views. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm just like, "How?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. I mean, that's
also just really funny, but- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I think it
definitely also helps, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fact that there are a
lot of YouTubers out there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like poking the shit out of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There's so many views
that are just mocking it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. So, like that in and of itself is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just free promotion, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] It's just so- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And, I guarantee there's lots of people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like hate watching this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so preachy that you
can't help but watch it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and think fucking hell, like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, "It ain't that deep, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It really ain't that deep." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like I've fucking
seen Disney movies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> less preachy or cheesy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. Right? Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right? Like it's, it's fascinating. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I found it like fascinating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> seeing that this was the hot thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's going on right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I also showed him Arcade Craniacs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if you don't know what that is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you know what that is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. What's that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the guys who do the 3:00 AM </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Among Us a BTS meal video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I told him. It's honestly impossible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not like a real video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, the point is is that
they're basically this channel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that parodies kid videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the 3:00 AM videos for literal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like five-year-olds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but including like adult
jokes that kids wouldn't get, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but also mocking and parodying the style. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really, like it's the
most internet humor thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've ever watched, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so good. I don't even,
I can't even explain it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like, just watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] All right. All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And, you'll see it like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's the channel called? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Arcade Craniacs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Arcade Craniacs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. And like, they just do a thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like, "Oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I went to get the BTS meal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then at 3:00 AM </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and then the BTS Jimin
was delivered to my door </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he like pronounced the
name horribly or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's already funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then he's like, what is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he drinks the Sprite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's like, it's BTS sweat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know I was at the concert, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it tastes like their sweat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's just like, what is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need to watch this now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, and it's so popular
right now on YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's so fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's going on with YouTube recently? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just so obscure now and weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so good though. I
love where it's going. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's getting so meta, like everything is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so meta right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you haven't checked
it out, I kind of think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to watch a lot of YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to enjoy it because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a parody on shit YouTube
that adults wouldn't watch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you would only know
if you watch videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that roasted the kid's content anyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or you seen the memes of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It requires like four
layers of YouTube knowledge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to enjoy it, but if you
watch a shit ton of YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you might enjoy it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, check it out. It's
a fever dream anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's very funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - All of what we've discussed right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has just been a fever dream to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We talk a lot about YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's just because we live it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We watch it so much. It's so
relevant to everything we do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When you show me Dhar Mann, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I ended up staying up like drunk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> till 4:00 AM watching his videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just being like, "Wow, what is going on?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why did you watch them? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where was my invite? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That sounds like an amazing time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, you were away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. You were away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It would have to get
a little celebration </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to open this office. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then we went back and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Let me show Dhar Mann. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just like my, my drunk 4:00 AM mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like could not comprehend
what I was watching. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause it was like, it
was a fever dream for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Watch one Dhar Mann video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I can't, it's so hard to explain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what makes it weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll give you a quick
run-through of Dhar Mann video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll do one it's like, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hi. I am cheating wife." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hi, I am husband with failing business." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Damn, you're so gross poor husband. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Get away from me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to cheat on you with someone." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She cheats, and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Wow. My business is now succeeding." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Cheating wife wants to come
back and sleep with him again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but he's like, "No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm successful now and
happy in a relationship. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Moral of the story, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't cheat on your husband </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who is working hard and
being nice. That's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like what? It's just- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then everyone claps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not even deep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just common sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, it's just, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Watch it. It's funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's pretty funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I saw one about like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't watch it alone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Get, get a bunch of your friends, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> have a few beers and then
enjoy the nature of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I saw one that was like against </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> someone being racist towards an Asian dad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to open a nail salon
or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I think it was more of
the story is don't be racist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was just like, great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I liked the idea that somebody out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who is a susceptible to a video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> changing their whole view on racism </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they just watched
this and they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Shit, I've been racist this whole time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't believe this." You know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I should go and apologize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to the two Asians I know in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's like, it's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's like, you're out
here hustling, and I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, it, that's easy
to make money off of do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But, it's not going to
change anyone's mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, you know, I
appreciate the sentiment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because obviously, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> racism is bad, you know,
in case you didn't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you didn't know, you
should watch a YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of Dhar Mann. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. But I was racist before Dhar Mann. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like every white man, I was racist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was going to cheat on my boyfriend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was trying hard to
succeed in his business </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> until I saw- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then I opened a fortune cookie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or a Dhar Mann video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally the
fortune cookies of YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was a gold digger
before I met Dhar Mann. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Now, I'm not longer a gold digger, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I appreciate everything in life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Speaking about like the reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why you weren't there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to share our Dhar Mann watch sesh Joey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I heard you went to Nintendo world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah you did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? How did you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it possibly the Nintendo
World shirt I'm wearing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. You look like
a fucking staff member. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Can I help you? Can I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I forgot that you were there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can I just say the Nintendo
World staff like uniforms? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're not uniforms. That's drip. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it'll literally, it
literally looks so fucking cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I want that for merch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck these other, even
though I bought this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fuck these other shirts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, I want what they're wearing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck you, but I'm going to buy it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, Aki and I went to USJ,
Universal Studios Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's Nintendo World
there for our anniversary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Very cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'd never been to USJ before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In fact, I very much
despise amusement parks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey doesn't like amusement parks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't like amusement parks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like thrill ride amusement parks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like roller coasters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm the complete opposite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate roller coasters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why do you hate fun? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's wrong with you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think that's why I
don't like amusement parks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because a lot of amusement
parks are very focused on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like roller coasters
and like thrill rides. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the best part. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's literally the best part. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's literally the reason- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you hate about them? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why do you hate fun? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't hate fun,
because they're not fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, they're not fun? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think roller
coasters are fun at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you scared of them? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm A, I'm scared of
them, but also B I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> why do I have to wait
in line for two hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to enjoy a ride that lasts five minutes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's an experience you'll never get. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's an experience I can get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In fact, it's an experience
I don't want to get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I will fully buy the fact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that I am very much a pussy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it comes to roller coasters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Your words, not mine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, it's fine. I will live with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But so we went to Nintendo World </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it opened up in what was it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like February of this year? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was a couple of months ago, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but obviously it was
fucked for a little bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because of like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because of "finna
open during a pandemic." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like, I'm going
to open during pandemic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then like no one came over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was fucked for a few months, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I think like a month or two ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they like reopened to the public. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So we were like, "Fuck it. Let's go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like we couldn't go during
the press event. Let's go." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm an Nintendo boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm a gamer boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like Nintendo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're gamer girl. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm a gamer boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've played a video game before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I know Mario. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we went dead ass, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was probably the most fun I've ever had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in an amusement park. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was so fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So first of all, they
absolutely nailed the aesthetic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never, like people talk about- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That was probably the thing
that it looked amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It looks amazing like
in the promotional videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It looks a hundred times more impressive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when you're there in real life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was it sunny when you went? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We were kind of in the
middle of a typhoon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did it still look good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It still looked amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because all the
promotional pictures are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in like the best lighting in existence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I bet it would look and
feel amazing in the clouds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause that's what it's like in the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If it was pouring it down, you'd be like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. I think the
weather was on our side </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the weather like subsided </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like kind of halfway through the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But when we were there, it
was like pouring quite a bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But even in the rain, like I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought they had just
oversaturated the trailer footage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it looked more impressive. I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, they didn't over
saturate this at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They didn't color correct this at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This looks just as good
as in the trailer footage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's really impressive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the scale of it
is so massive looking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, because like you see like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the little like kind of mounds in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the background and you think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, that must be like really tiny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're fucking huge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're like buildings </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can like walk into. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no, I was just going to say like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the one thing that
I really enjoyed about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the fact that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, there's only
like two rides, three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's. That's what I
was kind of like sad about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that there was only two rides </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and one of them was like a
car that takes you around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was like, wow, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there is put all of the budget
into the set design, huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. If you're into
like amusement parks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because of like roller
coasters and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think that's
really the place for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Luckily, it's in USJ, so there's plenty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of roller coasters in USJ, but like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It'd be perfect for you though, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Perfect for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's probably why
you enjoyed it so much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I'm a fucking Nintendo
boy through and through. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And there were no real like
roller coasters type of thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think the thing
that impressed me the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the fact that you can
buy these like kind of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even know what they are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like these electronic
watches essentially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can wrap around
and it essentially connects </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the entirety of Nintendo World </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and makes the entire park interactive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, how big is the park? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Damn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. How big is the park? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want to say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How long can you see everything in? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like an hour? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. Easily in an hour. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - See the thing is even within, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though the space isn't big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so jam packed with
shit that you can do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like literally there isn't a
single piece of wasted space. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like this was engineered
to shit where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we got to feel every little space </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up with something to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, I feel like the electronic bands </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that you have to buy it
like 3000 yen or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like 30 bucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like 30 bucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think if you don't buy that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're probably missing out
on it about 70% of the park. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What does it allow
you to do with the band? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so the bands, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what they do is there are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so there's an app that
connects to the band </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that app, when you look at it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, so you have to download the app? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. So you download the app. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God, that's so annoying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean, it's
a little bit annoying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess if you're a tourist though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're a tourist watch out for that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe pre-download the app. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, he was showing
me the app earlier. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It fucking looks incredible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can show you to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You download the app </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you go to the
Super Nintendo World </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it loads up essentially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh. Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then, you get a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so basically there are these like stamps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can get for achievements </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you unlock by interacting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in Super Nintendo Wall. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, you're literally just
playing achievement hunter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with this theme park. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm literally getting X-Box achievements </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> except instead of X-Box, they're Nintendo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bruh. I'm gaming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bruh, have your 100%ed Nintendo World? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like what's kind
of big brained about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, that looks so clean, honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is clean, and like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it does like an interactive map as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that shows you like all of the locations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you've been to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh. Okay. That, I'd fuck with that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. So, you know exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like which parts of the world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you haven't explored yet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or haven't actually interacted with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that's so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like, it's honestly like the band is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> half the experience
because there's a couple </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of rides in Nintendo World </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can't even access,
if you don't have the band. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's kind of shitty though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you pay full price for the ticket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you gotta pay
30 bucks to get that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought so too, but
then the actual amount </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of experience that you can get on top, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you do pay for the 30 bucks is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's completely worth it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll trust you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's also good as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's also good as well,
because there's so much, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it adds replay value
to actually going back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like doing achievements </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like getting the best scores </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and all that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, if you go around
with like a bunch of friends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, I went around with Aki, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we were like trying to
fucking like one up each other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in terms of like achievements
and all of that kind of stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and like that is half the fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Trash Taste special. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just kidding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, USA hit us up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just realized that
Nintendo really just added </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> micro transactions to a bunch
of real life theme parks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They really did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, I dunno, I thought
it was fucking big brained. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you can eat if you're, especially, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you like love anything Nintendo- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And, you're like fully ready </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to like immerse yourself
in the actual park. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, it's like Marioland. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Then if you're fully
ready to immerse yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the land, like completely, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just forget about the fact that like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, this is essentially
one big micro transaction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you live the dream, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you live the dream like
you do at any amusement park, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it is the most fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, how long did you spend in there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We spent about like five
or six hours in there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but I could easily spend
a whole day in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well like, we spent about
like maybe three quarters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the day there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I wanted to like go around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the other parts of USJ,
'cause I'd never been before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we went to like Harry Potter World </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like Jurassic Park World, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and all that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's there as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's the good thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can spend like a decent
amount of time there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but if you get bored, just pop on over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to Harry Potter World
which is like literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two minute walk from
Nintendo World, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, it was super fucking fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I want to go at some point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I haven't been in a rush to go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I know that eventually
when people come to visit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're going to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to go there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And, I'll be like,
"All right, let's go." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't want to go that like five times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and have to take someone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, let's go again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How were the crowds there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There crowds, well, it
was like decently crowded. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think right now USJs really banking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off Nintendo World, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because I think the majority of the park </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was at Nintendo World. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. That's right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it is the newest thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like they're shilling the
fuck out of Nintendo stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even outside of Nintendo World. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I mean, when I went there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it totally made sense as
to why that was the case. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it was, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> damn this is like
completely different level </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of upgrade to like any
other world out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want to go. I want to go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want to go as well, and I want to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> before the country fully opens up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you get like the rush. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, you know it's going to
be hell when there's tourists. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Tourists are going to be flooding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You probably enjoyed it
'Cause there was no one there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like, imagine it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're at Nintendo World. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, "Whoa,
what secrets can I see?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then, there's a line
for like every single thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And every single thing you've
got a bump or you use the- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. We only had to
wait like max 15 minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for each ride. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is very good
for an amusement park. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is really good for USJ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because, as we know
the worst thing about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> amusement park are the
crowds and the lines, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because like, I think they also like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like a good cue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I like a good wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the British
coming out in you man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is. I like a good cue. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't mind waiting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I think they also structured it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so that they were like anticipating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the massive amount of lines. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like the VR
Mario Kart, for example, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is easily the best
ride that they have there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did VR, Mario Kart with
you in Ikebukuro, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - At VR park, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it the same thing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Completely different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So, VR Mario Kart in VR park in Ikebukuro, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> used to be in Shinjuku was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're in like a still cart </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have the VR goggles on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you have like the glove on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can use to grab items and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but the car had hydraulics in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you would like when
you did forward it turned. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. But this time around
in the Nintendo World, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the car itself is also moving. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's like moving on a rail. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then when you move it does it move? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And when you move it it moves </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have the VR goggles
on so that everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> around you now is basically a hologram. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, it's just VR go-kart? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - VR go-karting essentially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds fun. I'm down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a hectic dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's super fucking hectic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like that, obviously that one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think is going to be the most popular, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think they perfectly
planned for it as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because from the entrance of the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to enter Bowser's
Castle to get to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, like the front of it
looks like Bowser's Castle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like the interior and
everything is completely, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> perfectly modeled off the Bowser's Castle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So you like go up the stairs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's a giant Bowser statue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you have to walk past. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, that's all part of the line. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, you walk past it and
it's like all the Mario Kart, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like trophies all
stacked up like in order. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] That's cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like they clearly anticipated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for there to be a lot of people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, they were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we got to make waiting
in line entertaining. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what like Disney
already did so well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, I don't really like Disney, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the themeing was on point, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Disney's theming was on point,
but then Nintendo was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let me one up that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let me one up it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a lot easier, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you have a smaller
contained land to work with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Definitely. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, but I mean, I do want to go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I will go at some point,
I don't know fucking when. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The only thing that would one up that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if they added other Nintendo franchises </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then kind of expand on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Like Zelda. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because right now it's only
really the Mario universe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If the added light Zelda stuff Kobe stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or, like any of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do wonder if this was like a thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that Nintendo wanted to
do or Universal was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Come on Nintendo, we've
got a little plot of land." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have a feeling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> This is kind of like a
trial run for Nintendo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] That's what I thought. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if we opened up like a fully dedicated, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Nintendo World where there was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different worlds for different franchises, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we don't want it to completely fuck up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So let's just like borrow USJ for a second </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like, "Can we like test it out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with like one small segment?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And if it does, well then maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> down the line we'll make like
an actual fully dedicated- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because, they could do a Nintendo World. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like and actually have like, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They have enough franchises. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - With the amount of money
they made during the pandemic, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> especially dude like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They could easily
open up their own world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if they wanted to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, just think of all
the properties they have, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, all right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well you've got like everything covered. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you can do any ride, any excuse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what I mean?
Like everything's covered. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why, haven't they done this already? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Come on, Nintendo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, Nintendo Land
from what the sounds of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sounds really fucking good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and really fun already. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, imagine that on like
a full-scale theme park </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and maybe Joey will have an amusement park </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that you actually enjoy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Right. Cause I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly like that was
probably the most fun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've had in an amusement park ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What food do they have there? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. Som they have Toad's Cafeteria. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. And, what do they sell
in Toad's Cafeteria House? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - At Toad's Cafeteria, they sell, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the food that it was
actually pretty decent, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not the best themed food I've had. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I've been to like
a lot of like themed- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Does it look like Mario characters? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So one of them was this like tiramisu- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like tiramisu </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was shaped after
the like question block. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh. That sounds fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. So, there's a tiramisu
shaped like question block. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's also like a mushroom soup, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like the container is
actually like the red mushroom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh. Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you like open up the red mushroom cap </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like there's mushroom
soup on the inside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was pretty cute. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like it when the thing is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the design of the character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever they're trying to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not intrusive to
the flavor of the food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It really me off when they
do that shit at Disneyland. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or, when they like make
into like smiley faces </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with my food and I'm like, listen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't care about my
food being a smiley face. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't fucking do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to feel like I'm two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't give a shit at your theming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want you to draw a
smiley thing on my steak. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a fucking steak. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, obviously I feel obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like Nintendo wall was definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> aimed more towards like younger children. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. It's geared towards me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm adult. I don't like it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck children. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but I feel like
they added so many elements </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that like adults could also easily enjoy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I fucking enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My mom would never
buy me the food anyway, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I was a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, it didn't matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She'd bring the food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She's like, "You're not
having a theme park. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's ridiculously
expensive, Connor. No way." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was a bit expensive. But you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> as a first time experience,
I think we had to try it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was, again- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like cinema popcorn, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wasn't the best experience
I've had at a themed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like cafe or anything, but pretty decent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I don't know if it's still there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but in the UK and like the
best, my favorite theme park, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they had the Alton Towers. Great one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They had a restaurant that
was like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> eight dollars all you can eat pizza. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Oh shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was like, "Yo, I'm like, yo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's go to the theme park." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What, for the rides?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
- For the pizza bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - For the all you can eat pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck yeah, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it was great, 'cause you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you could vomit all off on the ride. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meanwhile, you go to Disneyland. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, "Would you
like a slice of pizza? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Eight dollars, please? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the thing, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't think I would
appreciate it that much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until I was given all you can eat pizza </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for like eight bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, it wasn't great pizza, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was all you could eat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] That's what counts. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - On my life, I was like
this is the best theme park. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck the rides. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck the theming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All you can eat pizza. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you put that at a theme park, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it automatically goes up a star rating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That just becomes
the best establishment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got to Mario World, they're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unlimited tiramisu, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just normal tiramisu, we
just got it from somewhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Okay shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. Now we're playing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay fine." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah fuck yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just give me food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just play the Mario
theme in the background </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'll feel like it's themed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's just something so nice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you go to a theme park </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and for one minute, they're
not trying to rip you off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel the only thing
about Nintendo World </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that I was like, "Whoa,
that's a bit weird," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was toad speaking Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What does that sound like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor squawks) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because, when you go
into Toads' Cafeteria, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like, on like a projection screen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like Toad, like in the kitchen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like preparing food and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he like notices you coming in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, he's like, "Oh, hey," kind of thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but in Japanese and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, that's, that's weird. Don't talk." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. In Japanese games,
they use the English for the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well, it's bad English but they record it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but they use
like that (Joey squawks) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> type of voice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then at the theme park, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they can't get away with just- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Konichiwa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's just like, "Yeah, Konichiwa," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, "Oh, that's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just go (Joey squawks)
and then just be with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor squawks) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. It's really fucking bizarre. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - (Connor squawks) Eat
my fucking head. Eat me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Drink out of my head please. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> My head is your communion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck Toad? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. That was the only
part where was like, hmm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like the same thing
happened in Harry Potter World. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause we went to like, one of the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the rides of Harry Potter world is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that you go into the Hogwarts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like a kind of
4D interactive, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it feels like you're on a
broom and going through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Harry Potter and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's a really
fucking cool and intense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Only thing that threw me off is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Daniel Radcliffe, speaking Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you saying
Radcliffe speaks Japenese? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone was speaking Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Does he have like a
British Japanese accent? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it was just literally just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they just grabbed a random
like anime voice actor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I was like,
"Yeah, (foreign language)," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like, "Oh, this is weird." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Daniel, what happened to you bro? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like anime double. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What was the best
line that he boiped out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The best line? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was just like, when you are, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a scene where you like go like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> fight through all the dementors </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's I think in the English version, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can actually see
Daniel Radcliffe mouthing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, "Wow, that was
a close one. Wasn't it?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or, something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, in the Japanese one, he
was like, (foreign language) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like "Oh, Daniel, why?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would they massacre my boy like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did they say the English spells? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the English spells,
but said in Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, what is it the ah? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, it's like in Castle Carna. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, it's not like, Wingardian Leviosah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like Wingardian Leviosah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know why that's so funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Foreign people trying to speak English. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Very funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] I know. I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but overall Nintendo was- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Out of 10? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like solid nine, I reckon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nine out of 10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Really makes you feel like Mario. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How much was that T-shirt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I must know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How much was this one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This one was a 3,500 yen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess that's not too bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was expecting you to be like $50. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, there were like
$50 ones as well. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What were they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, they better be like designer Gucci. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, one of them, I actually bought it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it looked really cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it was at the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was next to the Bowser's Castle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was like a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they themed the much store
next to the VR Mario Kart theme </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as like in looking like the inside </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like a Mario Kart garage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So they had like all of the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there was one shirt that I bought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that had like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in a lot of like a car racing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like jackets that had like
all the patches of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the sponsors? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that sounds cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it was a shirt
and all the patches were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Mario themed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Mm-hmm (affirmative). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So like that was really cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Ooh, 55 bucks? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck it. I'll take it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Sometimes for me it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not about the price. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, does it look cool? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And is it thing that I can only get here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll probably fucking get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Man, 12 year old would- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why they can
hike up the price. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exclusivity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And, I'm like "Take my money, Nintendo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You been taking my money for 26 years now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not going to be mad." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What did you think is
the best part of the park </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that you enjoyed? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the fact that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> buying like the electronic
bracelet and the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The micro transaction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's legit the fact that they made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> literally every single aspect of the park </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interactive in some way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't wait for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because like there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like all these like question blocks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that are just randomly lying around, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can punch it and it
makes like the coin sound </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then the coins get
added to your bracelet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It's just, imagine you rock up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a family of six
and then they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, you have to pay
a yeah, an extra 180?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "What, what?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It'd be so sad though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wish they would do
include it in the ticket. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or, I'm sure, maybe you can,
can you buy a tickete what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Can you buy a ticket that includes it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can buy it with the ticket. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That'd be cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, we didn't know about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So we were just like,
"Oh. This is an option." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Download the app before
you go as well, I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can't wait for the Nintendo
World speed runners to go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We need a Nintendo World any percent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nintendo World any percent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And, I'll fucking do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm going to try and go
for the record if I go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And, don't go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Alright, well I guess
that's it for today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't really have
anything else to talk about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We can talk about
one other thing though. </SPEAKER_03>
