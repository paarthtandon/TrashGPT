<SPEAKER_00> yeah and you see we've already got wine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> glasses because we had no idea what this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could possibly be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it is fancy so basically at our </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> supermarket i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> tell the story while you're opening that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so basically at the supermarket that we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> live near which i'm not gonna say yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh there's like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a boost section like a liquor store </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> section and i didn't know for the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> longest time that not only is there a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> liquor sauce section but there's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a dedicated section to wine okay like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like room i guess so i got a uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> an italian one i think overall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i i misread this at first i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> buruto </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like i was like this is this anime one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> naruto </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> borrows so wide yeah it just sounds like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a generic dragon ball villain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> thank you very much no worries i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> know too much about wines apart from if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um red or white what colors </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if they're red or white or if they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the ten from drops of god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't think it's that but barolo is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like uh i think it's like pretty well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> known in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> italy i think right the guy was like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah if you want like a well-known </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> italian wine like get barolo so uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> hey if anyone's watching this episode or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> listening to this episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably you're italian let us know if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> barolo i just thought they were like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] is a barolo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> rolo that's what they call boruto </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> actually it's funny because how i got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into wine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because how i got into wine initially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was literally um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drops of god because before that i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like why does anyone would drink wine i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just want a cold beer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't want to like but after reading </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you read drops of god once and you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like i love wine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wine's great i i read drops of god on a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think it was what was the flight i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know it's from like america or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> somewhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and uh i remembered reading drops of god </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know when like the little cart </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comes by yeah what do you want to drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of course i want what i'm a connoisseur </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of fine taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of course why even ask me the question </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i was about to ask i hope you were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> wine on the flight away so so she you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> know she gets out there the little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bottle of wine they crack open and pours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it into this plastic cup for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like the most pathetic drink </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'd ever had i was sitting there like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> swirling this plastic cup that like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know ten-year-old would drink a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> drink out yeah yeah just mean that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's good yeah because table wine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we all know table wine on flights is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grape juice with hand sanitizer in it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's it's disgusting i mean because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you you can't even taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> uh like things that aren't like super </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> salty right on flights anyway yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel like wine is the worst thing i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like it's that point when you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> watching something that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> super good like for example when you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watching shokugeki </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this food looks amazing and you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sitting there with your [ __ ] takeaway </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> combining meal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like this is this is kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like a5b </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> now just imagine hard enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing more orgasmic than craft mac and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cheese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which was another meme that uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> originated from drops of god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if if oh come on i'm sorry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the podcast is starting now happy </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> discussing today what's the topic i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the topic of you know we we talked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh we because we live quite close </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> together right we live within </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know walking distance yeah so i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think a good topic would be how we you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> know what our experiences are like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> living here in japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now that we've all finally moved here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because we just moved here um how many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> months have we been living here now it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually like eight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> eight months she's crazy really yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah october so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just hit june so it was like and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this was like middle too it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> seven and a half months i guess yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and that's it does not feel like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> no well to be fair the last two months i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> might as well have been living in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] australia </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i like quarantine does things to you and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i hadn't heard anyone speak japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about two months except for like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> brief moment where you'd go out to buy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> groceries and you i just forget that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was living in japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah legit like i remember like catching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the train for the first time in like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> two months and i was just like the world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is full of water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like i felt like i was uh like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> cast away like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when he like tom hanks after castaway </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when he came back to humanity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know because i don't i don't know if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you guys have but yet but i still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> haven't gone into tokyo yet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> uh uh i went there like central tokyo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah i think the first time i went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yesterday and that was literally just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it was like quarantine was over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just on like the day of my birthday yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh this is this is fate i'm i'm gonna go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out and uh have some nice food but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even now there's like a lot of places </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are still closed yeah so it's it's still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not like everything's open yet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um but yeah it's it's been a really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fast eight months it hasn't felt like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eight years at all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i guess my first question to you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> guys my first question to you guys is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> made you decide to move to japan in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first place because you've been here for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how many years now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've been here four years now yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> guess for you it's more obvious though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean yeah because i've spent what like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> half my life here and i have family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> up north and in tokyo um at least with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'm pretty sure i've said this in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> videos before but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was gonna move to japan after i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> graduated from uni anyway </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i i think this was like back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when i had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe like 20k 30k subs so i wasn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing it full time at all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i was in like my second year of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> university and i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interning at like a japanese like it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> company which i believe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is now like defunct like it doesn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> exist anymore i don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so glad that internship never went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> through yeah but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so i i was gonna move to japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anyway because like it just makes sense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for me because i'm fluent in both </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> english and japanese which is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> such a huge plus here like if you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> both languages like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can pretty much get a job anywhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we'll we'll get to that yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we'll get to that and like no one in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> australia gives a [ __ ] if you can speak </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah exactly like my dad's works at like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a japanese it company for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 30 years he can't speak a word in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese yeah it's because no one in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> office can speak japanese right but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> here it's like if you can speak english </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you can do business with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> anybody yeah in or out of japan so it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just was like a natural process for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i get my paper i work at like some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] it company in japan and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we're all good so yeah it's funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i i reckon one of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> few industries where japanese is it can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> be super super important </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is anime and manga exactly exactly yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you might start your luck there yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly so like either way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like it was just a natural like path for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me to like move here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but you know instead of you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing that desk job that i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had set my plans on uh you know youtube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for me blew up like in my third year of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uni when i graduated and so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like all right i'll guess i'll do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this guess i'll do youtube for as long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> as i can and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're still doing it i'm still doing it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> somehow i'm still doing it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i know it's crazy the story of or i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> guess like the the original plan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that was brought up to you guys about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bbq yes like a year ago </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because i wanted to move here for a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> while i remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like since we first met each other and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> since my first trip to japan i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i could really see myself living here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this is and this is not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the typical weeb kind of fantasy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i actually never had that you know i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what like i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back in back in the day when it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mid-2000s yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the weeaboo dream was to live in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> japan and you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> work in the anime work in the anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> industry it was just like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dream that nobody had ever proven or you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it was just that weeb dream but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never really wanted that i was like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know i'm i'm happy with a normal career </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah um i'd never really fantasized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about going to japan but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember the first time i came here it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was so eye-opening for me because it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know when you know that feeling when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like man this country just works </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in a lot of ways and it's to do with my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i'm like this this could be a really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good opportunity for me yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i definitely felt the same thing with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> how i thought about japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i i couldn't have cared less about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> living here and i thought people were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> learning the language </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> at the time you know i was like 15 14 i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like that's kind of cringe bro </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like now now that you know i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually started to learn it i regret it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so much i regret that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't learn any because i could have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been like a few months ahead at least </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i wish i was more weeaboo yeah like now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now that the cringy weeaboo phase is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> over i wish i was that cringey weeaboo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because that would give me so much more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of an advantage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> now that i'm hearing yeah yeah exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a part of me with i remember when i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> used to think that way like anyone who's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learning it it's just like wow it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sad you're never like actually gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learn it but like to be fair if you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learning anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know any other kind of language </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if you only speak one i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good good on you like better yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know gives a [ __ ] and i really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> regret that i thought that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone everyone who's learning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese because of anime is pathetic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah but then again i was like an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> edgy teenager right and we all think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like like like you said i had no i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no intention or want to live here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i was pretty content in the uk and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even when i visited here i thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wow this is an amazing place to come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> visit right but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't think i was still sold yet on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> moving here because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think i don't know about you guys but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i really like need friends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> for every weeb but i i do need like to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> have friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i like see often otherwise like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really get like upset like you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the antithesis of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> every weirdo yeah like i i need to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> socialize or i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> really like it really starts to take a </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> able to you know have a good social </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> circle or meet people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean luckily that hasn't been the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> case but because i guess the big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> difference between you and me is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i've already like before japan i'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> already lived in thailand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for right right three years um so i had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> moving to a different country and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> finding new friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and to me it was like okay that's i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just starting the process </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all over again and it's just a new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> adventure i guess yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so it was a lot easier for me to decide </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hey i'm gonna i'm gonna move to japan i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> guess the biggest thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's you know made me think is that do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i really want to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> through this process again how long do i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> see myself actually living here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah um and to me it was like this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the last big move </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm gonna do before i kind of start to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think about yeah that's crazy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> staying in one place just flying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different countries every few months </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> which is what i was doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before yeah yeah i i don't know how you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> were doing that for like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like it was because you were you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> were going from like thailand to uk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to america america and then yeah it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it wasn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like i had three offices i had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> one in thailand one in the uk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and one in america that's a major </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> entrepreneur </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like the traveling just gets to you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man because i oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know when you're like at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> university you're like i just want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> travel i want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get out i want to experience new things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you do it every year for about a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> four years and it [ __ ] it [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> gets you in yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i think i'm definitely starting to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> phase out of that like i love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just any excuse to travel is great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because now i'm really starting to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to test </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> some some travel remember like when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> traveling to anime cons was exciting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and now the thought of having to go on a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> plane to get somewhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that was to me to me it's it's a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> harder than it used to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i guess because it's just because how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's become </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's always a 10 plus hour flight and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like the thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that is really draining we must sound so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> god i'm so annoyed we have to travel so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's i hate to win these concerts pay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for our travel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right but yeah i mean you know it's i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guess it happens right when you travel a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] ton i'm sure any anyone who has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like parents or family </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> friends who work their whole business is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to travel it does become drainage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean because it's it is a job i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because i like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's people want to travel but if you've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> ever had like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> office job which i did for the bbc and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you had to travel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to europe you have to travel to these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> places and it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hours and hours of traveling for the job </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it drains you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no matter where you're traveling to if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you travel there enough it'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it'll eventually drain you and it will </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a massive difference between </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> traveling for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> pleasure oh yeah for business and i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it doesn't seem </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it might not seem there's like a huge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> difference especially to someone who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't travel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot but after a while you're just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh man i have to go on this flight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> versus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yay i get to go on this flight i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the only time i'm like excited for a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> flight is when like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> netflix drops like a whole show yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that i'm like super hyped for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like yeah sweet like at 10 hours no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> one bothered me yeah i haven't watched </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this hell yeah that's like the only time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the worst is when you get to the app </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like [ __ ] i didn't download </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh god oh no we have to pay for shitty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> wi-fi to scroll on twitter for 12 hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> cool i have to play this solitaire game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for 10 hours that doesn't require any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> internet yeah it's like when you sit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> down for a [ __ ] and you realize your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> phone's on one percent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like what do i do when this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> battery runs out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like another thing is like time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> differences and yeah adjusting sleep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> schedule </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i got a question for you because we went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through the same kind of flight how did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> find the traveling to the crunchyroll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime awards because to put things in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> perspective we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had we were there for like one day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one two two days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right um and we had to travel how long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> did you have to travel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 16 ish hours i think it was for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crunchyroll anime awards yeah for me it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was 21 hours of traveling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because you're in the uk at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> time i was in thailand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is even worse yeah that was the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> straw that broke the camel's back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after that i was like right you know if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if i'm traveling too far </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's got to be something man i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i remember hanging out with you after </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you came back from that and you were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> still pissed off about like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you had to endure that and i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all right well you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i just want to say cheers you're all for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> not inviting me to that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you saved me a lot of trouble no i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a great experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i'm trying to i'm trying to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brand uh friendly here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> my brand like i'm not saying the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experience is bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what i'm the the thing that was bad was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> me having to adjust </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> immediately to uh to like a 16 hour time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then two days later have to adjust </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> back yeah and try to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in like try to be in a working state not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to mention in between that you have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go on stage in front of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thousands of people yeah and be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah just just just nail this don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> act like you're sleepy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah no pressure it was fun overall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i like uh networking with people and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like meeting other youtubers you don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> get to see often is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty fun but anyway cycling back to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the japan stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when in your timeline did you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> get like i guess presented with the idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or the offer of moving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like when was that or do you remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the date ish i can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> remember the dates the exact time and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> location </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> roughly um when was it for you because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i know that you knew you were like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> offer had been presented itself to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and i think it must have been like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in either like february march-ish this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like three or four months before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> ax i know that yeah when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember it was like at least a year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ago when i heard about it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so it was i think i guess from the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> timeline where it came up to me knowing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was possibility </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me actually like finishing the move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it was probably like like seven eight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> months oh yeah it's it's been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's been well over a year for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> knew that you knew before me so yeah how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it happened for me was i was i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was just sitting in a book walker </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meeting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we were just talking about i can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember some some random stuff about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what book walker you know wants to do in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the future and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um the person who i was talking to which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can i can i mention your name alan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not going to throw i'm not going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> throw you on there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so so melin who is basically our manager </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're all our managers now um she </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically just asked me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have you ever thought about moving to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that was just kind of a this it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of came out of nowhere for me yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like i didn't know how to react to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like that's a loaded question yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i'm not gonna say no but you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know when you like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ask the question and it's obviously for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a purpose like it's not just it's not a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hypothetical yeah yeah yeah and you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh this this this could actually be a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> thing yeah and so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um i went away i thought about it and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah if i'm not gonna do it now then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when in my life am i gonna do it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah and then i guess the idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just grew from there from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what if like from it being a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> hypothetical question to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what needs to happen to be able to bring </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> an annie tuber </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to japan as a job yeah right right right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and so that started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> my whole process when did you when did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you hear about it uh yeah i think it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it must have been around march february </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not 100 sure i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think i was i think i was on call with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> maylene i think maylene brought it up to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and and was basically the same thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> hypothetical do you like japan or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something like that right and i think i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> oh wait or maybe i was in japan at the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was something right a thing where it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like not concrete and it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hey think about it you know like if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> want to do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then i think uh two or three months </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> later it became a bit more serious of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay do you want to do it i think was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that similar thing to you yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i think we had time to think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about it and then seriously they asked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and it went from the it went from a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hypothetical to oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah oh this is actually happening i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm moving to japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and this because yeah i don't think i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> spoke to you about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your thoughts on it i maybe i might have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> at the time but i can't remember but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were you like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from the first time you got heard or you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> were given the offer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were you gonna take it or yeah i think i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was i think i was always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to take it i think because i had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> wanted to move to japan for a while even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for a little bit yeah i hadn't really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> put much thought into how long i wanted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to stay here but i was thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hey you're going to get this chance yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> once in your life i want to i want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like if i hated it then i would great at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> least at least i've done it right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um but i was i was pretty concrete </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when i got the offer yeah that you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna take it i was gonna take it i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what i was more worried about was how it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to happen or how what the process </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i think there's a lot of stuff like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i guess because we'd only interacted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with book walker through maylene yeah it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think maybe we were a bit like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> skeptical about what goes on in the back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> end right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i don't know what's happening right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah um but they're great by the way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> uh the two characters very nice and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> melee will kill me if i say i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's against their contract um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but i think the huge like advantage for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least youtube was the fact that and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know a lot of people who don't do this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely should is that you guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> visited japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> enough times yeah to like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well i mean i i was there for a while i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i know a lot of stories of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> people who move here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like thinking like oh japan is this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a wonderful place yeah you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like nothing could go wrong and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone's so friendly and then they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> move here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and their expectations are just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> completely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> rejected yeah there's a lot of stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's different between </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> moving here and living visiting and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> moving here which we can get into later </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for me i think it goes back to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> mentality of i never felt like moving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here or i never thought i would you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> want to move here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um because of the fact that i liked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime you know i think i think that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the biggest thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if you want to move to japan just purely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for anime you're gonna have a basketball </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> play the weeaboo dream yeah it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's not it's not real </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like honestly there's probably worse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reasons but it's pretty what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like for me in terms of my exposure to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime it hasn't actually increased too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> compared to when i was living in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> thailand because there is like a massive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime fandom in thailand and just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> asia in general </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so unlike like there was there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> big difference between like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like say england to japan but from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> thailand to japan i still have to watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime online sub because i can't watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't watch it on tv because i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it yet even if you did the schedule of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> airing is so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i'm not going to stay up till 3am </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's just not worth it exactly it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of reminds me like old cartoon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> broadcast schedule right like yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just all over the place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> constantly like it's weird yeah anyway i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think when i was presented with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> offer i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't initially i wasn't that keen on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it mainly because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i didn't really know anything and i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know when someone's like hey you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to come here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to this country it's like okay i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> japan's cool but i literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't yeah i literally don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> anything yeah um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think over time i just especially when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i found out that you were gonna go 100 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think that was like all right well at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> least i have you know my boys here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so if i do get lonely i'll be good yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i mean you know meeting friends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't a problem anyway but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think it is scary though it is part of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it yeah i think that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i'll go into later with like what i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think is important yeah you move here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then just got to the point where i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had nothing better going on and people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> gave me so much [ __ ] for saying that in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> my video by the way i got oh really yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i literally said in my video i said uh i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> said nothing better going on that's why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i moved here and people think that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm being like nonchalant or joking like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i didn't like when you're a youtuber you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't have anything to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other than youtube and hang out with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> your friends and do whatever you need to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do to be happy but yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i literally had nothing better going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so i'm like in my head </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no reason why i wouldn't take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this because it gives me a purpose to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know just better myself as a person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i get to learn new things get to meet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> new people i mean that's a huge reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why i moved as well is because like in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> australia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know what are you doing right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i had like great friends you know from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uni </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and high school who i would hang out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> with every now and then right yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i had places to go to yeah but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it wasn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> exciting anymore for me like it was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> routine yeah and like totally i hate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> getting into a routine with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything right so i was like yeah i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i haven't like yes i've spent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> half my life here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> technically but i haven't really like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gone out to like fully support the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> country and even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> four years later i'm nowhere near close </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to exploring this place yeah like there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> are so many more places i want to go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i still haven't left tokyo it's been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like eight months like i haven't left </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> tokyo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that road trip that we planned all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> once once the roanoke is gone it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happening okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i've i've left tokyo once yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the the decision to move to japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> funnily enough was probably the easiest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> part of the process </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really oh yeah okay well first of all i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> mean you're very lucky </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah you know if if you're half japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and have a japanese passport </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's gonna be easy to move here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for anyone else who's thinking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> moving to japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> uh whatever visa you're thinking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coming on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it is going to be a tower yeah it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and this year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or this year from oh sorry from april uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this year i believe they changed the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> rules to make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> visas more uh easy or easier to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they need more immigrants to work here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the population's getting older </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they allocated 40 000 worker permits </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and in the article </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they only managed to allocate 4 000 this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> year of the 40 000. what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the yeah wait it's 40 000 like per </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> year uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for some specific kind of uh like visa </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for this year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right right they only managed to do one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> tenth of that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like not a problem because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> don't think there's like and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like there's not demand to move here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah probably one of the countries that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i think people have most interested in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> moving to out of a lot of places right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's just i think that that if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> anything says a lot about how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> difficult it is to move here yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly i mean i can't speak on any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> other visa processes but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know everyone i've talked to has had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like a difficult process unless you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just coming here for a tourist visa </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> super easy it's super easy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or if you're one of those countries that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> has working holiday visas yeah which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately uh america does not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so sorry like like if you want advice on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how to move here easily get a working </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> holiday visa yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> probably gonna be i think those last uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe like a year and a half </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah year and a half i think it depends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> on the country at least australians have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a year and a half wow right i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe uk has like six months to a year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> depends but yeah a lot of paperwork it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> fell out yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think the hardest part of the process </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was finding an apartment oh my god oh my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean i'm a japanese citizen and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> still a pain in the ass </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you hear about on youtube and twitter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and everything like it's hard it's hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you see some people saying like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people are exaggerating it is it is 100 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> percent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] difficult especially if you're a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> foreigner as well uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you basically play under different rules </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's sad to say like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i you know in the uk i think if you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> money you get an apartment i think more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> importantly especially if you're a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> youtuber </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my god oh what because the the the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hardest thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at least in japan from my experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> about why it's so hard to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a [ __ ] apartment here is because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> freelancing is not a job here yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> freelancing you might as well be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> unemployed according to this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> government's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the government's like that typical asian </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> parent yeah it's like what you're not a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doctor or an engineer or a lawyer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like you're out of here you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unemployed right yeah you're working </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> part-time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's due to because they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> worried about if you can pay all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> rent and what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah right but the thing is is that they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't even like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know at least in like i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about the uk or thailand but at least in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> australia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you when you sign up for like an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apartment right usually the landlord </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> will be like okay can i see your bank </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> account </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like just to see how much money you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have saved up you know regardless of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what job you do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we just want to see that you have you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know money in the bank and if you do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you're like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but here in japan they don't check your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bank they check </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your work status to make sure that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like a constant flow of money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> coming yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's not just that as well because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're not japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and especially if you can't speak </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japanese most places aren't even going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to talk to you or consider you because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was a big problem we had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we went through like an agency </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made a list of about 10 to 20 apartments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we were interested in um and we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sent it off and applied </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for reject rejected from all of them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> jesus christ and we had a company as a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> guarantor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like having the like payments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> secured wasn't the issue it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of the time it was really dumb </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff like yeah can you sort the bins </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> properly and like stuff like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yes we're not 12 year old it's like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like the main concern you'll hear all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the time is can you sort your trash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> properly and it's like okay it might be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different from where i'm from but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i can learn yeah it's like like the the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> government councils in the area give you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> an english manual that tells you how to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do it like it is tedious and it is a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more complex in most places but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not like it's not rocket science </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's not like you're having to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like the weirdest stuff imaginable to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this stuff like it's basically just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rinse your stuff separate all of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's pretty much it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and i know there's some places uh in in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> europe that do way more thorough that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably don't have this concern when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> letting people yeah right houses it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like because it's the least of your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> concerns it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know yeah it's ridiculous yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the thing is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that if you'd go through an agency for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> example that specializes in foreigners </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and people who can't speak japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're going to be paying so much for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that ability to pay like a premium </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for that bill and that rent so it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you you either have a [ __ ] difficult </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> time finding a place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and getting past all the barriers or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just gonna pay a [ __ ] ton of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and those aren't two very good options </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the the only concern that they often </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cite like building managers etc </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that i find is like somewhat all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's fair enough is that they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> worried that you'll run away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but run away and not pay the rent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but if you have a guarantor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the whole [ __ ] point of that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> problem which you can't run away you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if we run away you're still getting your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> money like yeah and the house is vacant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> great no damage to it like this is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> win-win for the company i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> understand like we do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you play by their rules it's because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like typical </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like this is like one aspect of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's definitely one of the worst culture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i learned very quickly it's that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't matter what the business is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if they're not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 100 million sure that this is going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it might as well no risk they don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do risk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in any business venture whether that be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> paying for rent or like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything it's like if they're not 100 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> million </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> sure in every possible avenue ever yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just not happening and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know you know that's ridiculous i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think that'd be interesting to talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> about later on when we get to more of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the stuff that we've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experienced here yeah um but like was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there any part of the visa process </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> applying for i'm sure people are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> wondering i got a lot of emails i'm sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you did as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people asking hey how did you get a visa </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like was it hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> etc etc yeah if there's any advice you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can give someone who's watching who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> wants to come japan what would you say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like the main piece of advice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if they want to get a working visa um i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean i didn't apply for a working visa </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but uh so i don't have too much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience we didn't apply for it we had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immigration lawyers help us yeah we had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> immigration lawyers help us but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean i've applied for visas before and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah the worst the most painful part is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just waiting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's you're gonna be waiting a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you're gonna be waiting a long time and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just gonna be in this limbo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> limbo kind of because we had what it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the initial thing where they filed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for something called a certificate of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eligibility </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is basically if the government </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> decides if you can have a visa </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which isn't the visa itself which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> already sounds to me like that sounds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like we're adding steps </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where steps don't need to be but as you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> move to japan you'll learn that's what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they love to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so yeah we had to wait what was it six </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weeks for that six to eight weeks yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it could have been six to eight weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for this piece of paper to arrive which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then they send by post which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> makes you feel so uneasy because you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they're sending me a piece of paper </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through the mail </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i've waited two months for and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just like something's gonna go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone's gonna take it so you get you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get this piece of paper right um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get this this thing you need to prove </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you have a good reason to work in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan that you're the job or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know because you have to say what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your work is yeah they need to check </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> are actually like in that field et </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> cetera et cetera we had to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> send so much evidence yeah that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we were we were doing valuable work that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which i'm sure some people would argue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> youtube isn't but you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah at the end of the day if we bring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in money to the government and pay taxes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's valuable work right yeah but yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how many companies we've worked with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's notable that you know that that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then why we need to be in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what it felt like was i was applying for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a job yeah yeah you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like here's here's all my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> achievements here's what i can bring for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> please please let me play on your team </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> coach </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and then yeah so we get that certificate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of eligibility yeah which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is we get that and then you have to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> embassy so you turn that into a visa and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> then they'll put uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah again there's more steps because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first of all if you live in the uk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> uh the only embassy is in london now i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> felt i would feel bad for someone who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lives in like in the north of scotland </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't think they have an embassy in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scotland no no and in wales i had to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> all the way from wales that i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> luckily this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fast train doesn't matter yeah point is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one embassy so you're going to be taking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a day trip to get this thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah worst part is is that then if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go to the embassy which you might have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have to have traveled cross-country for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to wait five days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to then actually get the visa which is a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> little thing that is print out and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> staple in your passport so you have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the embassy you have to go back right so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i i just went home because i'm like i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> not staying in london for five days yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like if you're if you're poor you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you haven't got much money and you can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know the train tickets in the uk are </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> certificate which i didn't lose great i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> redo it so i had to scramble to get a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> new passport and that was the whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing and i got one within like five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> days luckily and </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> joked about it on twitter but like i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like not okay that day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh no no no and the worst part is right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's when you [ __ ] up this badly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you can accept that you [ __ ] up but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's messaging your friends being </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> and it's just you like just breaking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every message and it just ends with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i don't i don't think i can come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and i'm still annoyed to this day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i went around this is a very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> small town where i lost it i went around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like every shop in that area </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i had literally everyone in that area </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hey if you find this passport </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> not i'm gonna just cancel it today </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i still never heard anything yeah i like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was crazy and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know how i lost it so like from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your experience yeah to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for anyone who's listening if there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything that you need to know to make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the process </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> easier what would you guys say get a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> degree yeah degree helps a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> especially if it's you know like not an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> associates like like like a bachelor's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> degree </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i think a lot of their forms didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recognize associates i think it actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> said like specified like but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think associates is a thing in japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not a thing in the uk i don't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's not the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in japan right i mean it is a thing but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's not like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah as heavily emphasized on as a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> bachelor's degree </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i and i i saw a lot of people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> asking like oh how did we get it etc </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you you need to like have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> especially with a country this strict </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you need to have like concrete proof </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that like you can do something here like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't just come here on a whim </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you're worth unless unless you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like extremely extremely rich and they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> want your tax money like i think that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the only other reason like you need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even then you need a degree yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll find a way to because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll be like where are you getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this money from yeah and i imagine just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> having like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a a fair amount of experience in what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're doing and the reason you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coming here will help you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> uh i mean i can't talk about most just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what we went through or basically just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> come here to teach english </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that is like the instant like get in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> button yeah pretty much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can speak english and i can teach it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to someone they feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's probably like not a bad way to if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you if your goal ultimately is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> living in japan forever it's probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not a bad way to like transition into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> living here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because i know i know a lot of friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> personally who did start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with teaching english and then gradually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> moved on to something else cause like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you can gain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by teaching english english you can gain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> connections in the country yeah and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that transitions to an like a normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> office job or something like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> working with the company you know but if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you just want to get your foot through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the door i'm teaching english would be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the easiest way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for anyone to be able to do it but you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> still need a degree </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah either way you need a degree but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they pretty much accept everyone on that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as far as i'm aware </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again if you have a degree yeah it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't matter how good your high school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> essays were if you don't have a degree </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in in that like yeah which is why i'm so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> glad to drop out of university </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> listen to your asian parents go to uni </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if you want to go to youtube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> degrees right yeah yeah okay engineering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> baby let's go oh really yeah engineering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i never actually have known what you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have an engineering degree i haven't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah he has electrical engineering i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have mechanical engineering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> oh wow but he's a masters i have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bachelor's i've got a [ __ ] masters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> model </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> look at this boy spending more than four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> years at uni </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i i got to the third year i was like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't do it anymore i can't i can't do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this yeah i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have i got the required minimum yeah get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me out of here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't want to be here for another year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dude so like now that you guys moved to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what would you say are the pros and cons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of actually living here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean i want i want to know from you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> guys right because i mean i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experienced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan pretty much for half my life so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me the pros and cons are just very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> natural to me and i feel like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most of the cons that we might me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and god might have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you won't ever experience because one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can speak the language and read it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> fluently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and i don't know man there's some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> though that's the face of a foreign </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'm just gonna say it there's a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of discrimination here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i mean what country does i would say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i like understand it more because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> growing up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in and like in an asian country there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely discrimination in asia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just very different from what you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> see in the west i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the thing it's not racism it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's more xenophobia yeah yeah right and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you guys don't know the difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> between that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like racism is where it's like oh you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a different race to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so therefore you are worse than me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and xenophobia is like oh you're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> here yeah therefore you're i think he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comes because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i think it comes more from a place of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ignorance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's just you know because you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guys didn't open the country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean japan has been a closed island </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like the past two thousand exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what do you expect exactly um so it it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like it makes sense to me um but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for example finding finding an apartment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was my first experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with that where if you didn't if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> want if you're not japanese and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you didn't speak japanese then they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like scared to even touch you you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> consider you or even like or in that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> case </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially when you have a company </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> backing you in my mind i was like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't see what the problem is here like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like the model tenant here i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> single i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we can't write your name in kanji yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right that's the problem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> katakana name ew gross but i mean i have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that problem too because like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even though i am japanese and you have a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japanese name </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah the fact that i don't look it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> already a huge like wall that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah regular japanese people find a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> difficulty in getting over because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really funny as well because like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> during my intern days as well like i had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be like the guy to like if there was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a business partner coming to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> office </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i had to be the one to like get on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> phone with them and being like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're gonna you guys are coming at this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time in this day okay i'll come down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like meet you guys and greet you up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the office yeah but when i speak </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese i don't have an accent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and my name is japanese so there were so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> many times where i would go down to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> greet them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they'd be like who the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> are you the you're not the person on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> phone ryan i was like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i am it's like oh oh we thought you were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> japanese and i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i am japanese and they're like and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just so so many of like the older </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> generation especially they just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> can't fathom that there are these things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> called </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hafuz yeah it's just not a thing it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you're either japanese or you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> not japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah because the way i treat is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> treat it is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i treat it like exactly the same how i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would treat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my grandmother or like my grand my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> grandad who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lived in thailand in this in the small </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> village their entire [ __ ] life knew </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nothing about the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> outside world so they just they just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know yeah it's the same way with a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of japanese people where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of them especially like older </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people have never interacted with a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> foreigner or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or even like got to know them or even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> knows what's what the outside world is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like beyond what they see on the news </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and what they see on tv you know what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you don't want to like import </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> anything from japanese tv </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no no like you don't oh my god some of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the stuff they are it's like we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> called trash taste podcasts like if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's anything trashier than trash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taste podcast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it is [ __ ] japanese tv it is full of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> absolute </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> garbage yeah it's it's something i wish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that like a lot of youtubers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whose channel is focused all about japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> look speak about a little more because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not like something you can ignore </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're if you're foreign and or even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> look foreign and live here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're gonna experience it like totally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i didn't know anything about this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because no youtubers talk about it or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> anything yeah i feel like it's such an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> important </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like topic especially when you talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about living in japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's gonna be a factor like you're gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> be stared at and it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like like you've said like it's it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a place of like hatred or anything it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't see those kind of people a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of problem with a lot of like j </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> vloggers that do cover topics like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like when you live here you pretty much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get to know every j vlogger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah natural it's such a small community </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so i know pretty much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every like notable job you hear and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> there's been a number of them that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know that have made topics on like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the blatant xenophobia here in japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah but the problem is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think a lot of those videos aren't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taken seriously by the internet because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's seen as like a privileged problem </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah it's like you get to live in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japan you know so therefore </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you should just be able to put up with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this [ __ ] right because you get to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experience all this other cool stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know that's not the point of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> video right like it's still a problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> regardless of how privileged you may </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> living here like i think the worst thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that happened to me was um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the time one time we got the police </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> called on us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah and uh explain why we got the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> police call </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we didn't do anything illegal we just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> played mario party really loud yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> at like two in the morning very drunk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that that was all bad you know we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> caught we can't really complain about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so basically we got a noise complaint um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so the policeman came </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he basically asked joey you know um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who is he with yeah and i remember you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you saying like oh there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know one american one you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> british person and then there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me who who i'm thai so he mentioned that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm i'm with a thai friend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and as soon as he mentioned that he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with a thai friend the police was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> policeman was like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can we see your thai friend can we see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your thai friend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i go up there and i start getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grilled </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about why i'm here they want to see my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> passport and everything and they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> asking me about my my visa </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you show them your british party no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no as soon as i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as soon i was like oh i have a british </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> passport though they were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay you're free to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it was so messed up and i was like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> what the [ __ ] just happened what was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that it was so messed up like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and and the fact that they like only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> called you yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up there even though there was like a it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> multi-like cultural room in probably the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> entire apartment building i'm gonna say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it now i wasn't making the noise </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you weren't like the quietest one there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if anything and it's just i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that was the first time i like ever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> experienced that too and i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> jesus christ like they can't even be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> subtle about no no no yeah and i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you do know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this is like not cool right like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but to them it's just yeah you know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> think you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know i know i get stared out a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot which is weird for me because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously coming from like the widest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> place on earth i was just like another </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know just another like person and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i would've never experienced this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah um which i guess is also strange </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like um this goes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but okay in japan not exactly known for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the best like legal system if you will </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally if you're like arrested or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever or convicted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh charged with a crime you normally get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's like a 98 99 conviction </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know where this is going right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but also like this is the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've ever been like around police where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like [ __ ] please don't stop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me please don't stop like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i guess this is like conor checking his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> white privilege for the first time ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i if the police stop me right i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't explain to them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why i might like i don't know what i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> might do that's wrong you know what i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't want to get [ __ ] arrested </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like i get myself out of that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and yeah it's just a weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> experience for me that i've never felt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before and i'm sure people are like wow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> connor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> really seeing his white privilege for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first time ever in his life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's weird it's weird though right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because that's like stuff that i never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> considered i have to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> worry about ever right you have to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of experience it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately like first hand to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> really understand it right and that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the problem is that there are so many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i guess you know controversial topics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that concerning being a foreigner </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> living in japan that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm sure a lot of jvloggers want to talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about but because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> from the position that they're talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about it from it's very difficult to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> bring it up like oh they hate chinese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> people right because because it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's also like for someone who's the for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a foreigner who's never lived in japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's very hard to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> swallow and understand being like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that doesn't happen right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that must be just you whereas it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very much a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> common occurrence for any like foreigner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who lives here unfortunately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's unfortunate but it's it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a thing where you move here and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> realize there's pretty quickly yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty quickly yeah it's you know it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> works differently and people view you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> differently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as well um but i think to me that is you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the worst experience i've had yeah about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> moving to japan apart from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay can we talk about how slow japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> businesses work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] god everyone has this image that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan's this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like super optimized place like the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> optimized system on earth they figured </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it out speed running business </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like things just work you go to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurant you press a button on a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tablet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the food just appears in front of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you you know you're like this is the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> future </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you and then you go to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese business and you're like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that is that a fax machine are you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> using a fax machine right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or just like stuff you never even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> considered like a problem or like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> asking for permission for like the the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> slightest thing on earth like it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you show a logo or something in a video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we gotta find permission to do that it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just [ __ ] upload it it's a problem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll tell us you know see but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the thing right is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> japan doesn't understand what well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no risk as well but at least with like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what we do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> business-wise japan doesn't have fair </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> use </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no yeah so it's so difficult to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> permission for any like if you ask like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like as you said it's like can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can i just show this logo of your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> company that is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> publicly available to anybody yeah just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like slap it on for like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two seconds i'm not even gonna like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mention your name just slap it on it has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to go through like a hundred layers of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the company </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just to get a simple yes and that could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> take like a couple of days if you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> lucky </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah usually a week to maybe a month </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a business model where there's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine if every employer was a boss and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone had to ask for permission </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> constantly it's like you employees can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make their own decisions they have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ask </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their boss who then asks their boss and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that takes a week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's just to see if you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sharpen your pencil right like we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> haven't even got to business yet like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're just trying to figure out what the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] happening it's not even just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> business it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stunning everything it's everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> everything moves so slowly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i remember when you sign up for a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gym membership oh my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it took us how an hour hour and a half </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an hour and a half to sign up for a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] to get a gym car </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right because you know you know in um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know in america or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like basically everywhere where you get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get the terms and conditions right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] scroll through you click accept </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no in japan you're gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sit there and you're gonna read every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] term and you can agree to every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] term individually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're gonna they're gonna sit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there with you to make sure you read it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you not only are subject to going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through the fine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> print which is no longer fine it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> print </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like but they're like let me read it out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in case you're a [ __ ] illiterate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> piece of [ __ ] it's like see that's why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like when i signed up for the gym </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> membership because it's all written in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japanese right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i straight up just said like i can read </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i saved myself like an hour of pain i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> listening to this like [ __ ] hour-long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> monologue from this like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i think that's because we were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> foreign he was like he he really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really wanted to make sure he understood </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and bear in mind these weren't terms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like conditions that were like any like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> social things it was like literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the the bare bones of what a gym needs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to make sure you know like right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know don't run on the treadmill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you know your legs don't work right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just stuff like don't basically don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sue us stuff right stuff you wouldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> take for granted i remember he was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> asking us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> our translator like if we understood </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every single point every one of them is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you understand that on the treadmill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to have your hands on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> treadmill at all times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i looked at like like our friend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> abby i was like is he serious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's not a joke right he wants me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like like he legally has to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i have to agree that i'm gonna put my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> hands on have you ever seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like anyone butter like a crippled old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> man right on the treadmill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yes because that's how i run like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> three hands </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no one does that and you literally like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're signing this agreement and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> turn your head to see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ten people on the treadmill none of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> holding their hands and you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yes i agree and it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's all [ __ ] that's all you do and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and this is the stuff that you never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experience as a tourist because yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like perfectly separated the stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you experience as a tourist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah to like the stuff you experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> living here and the moment you do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is remotely permanent or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> reoccurring in a contract you you better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be ready to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bring every document that you've ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had in your life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the hanko which you'll lose a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm surprised they didn't ask for like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] birth certificate when signing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> up for the gym because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so formal with everything it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't need to know my life story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the perfect word everything in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan is so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> formal and you don't see it as a tourist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because everything when you're in japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on tourism </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're just sightseeing everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just works right you go to a restaurant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just works </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> living here all the little intricacies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and all the little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> things you take for granted that should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be quick yeah just takes a million </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> processors when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just the most unoptimized thing in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the world yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and there's just like a lot of things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that don't make sense like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in contracts like i've going back to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> paying rent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's this thing called a key fee what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was it like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what's this it's like it's key money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> money more money and and i mean you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> explain it if you want go ahead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay what can i explain it's two months </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of rent some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes it's so the amount is about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two months of rent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you pay to the rent owner to say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thank you for renting me your place for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> free like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't get any you don't get it back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you you this money is literally not a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> deposit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you just pay two months of rent just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which you also have to pay a deposit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and then on top of the deposit that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to pay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just it's basically a dick sucking thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like that's what it is it's like thank </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you so much for letting me stay in your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> apartment that's what it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it doesn't end there because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you then have to pay the rental </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the agency that got you the house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to pay a month's rent to them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as a fee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is just stupid because i think in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every other country they take their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> split </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from the person renting the house right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like not from you because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> renting a house shouldn't be you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shouldn't have to pay like six to eight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> months </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up front that's ridiculous yeah and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think it's the reason why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh a lot of homeless people here also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> struggle to get houses because how the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] are you gonna get six months worth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of rent right good money are you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> kidding me like that's like you expect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you when you look at the rent you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> expect like okay this is how much i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> going to pay for the first time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah you're paying like me two months </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah maybe like a month or two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah but like no it's like double </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or triple that and i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jesus christ like it's ridiculous yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stupid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's like yes six months worth of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> rent yeah in one sitting and you're not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna get like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two months of that back at all because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they want you to stay in that apartment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't want you to leave </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and i i like i like going around i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like moving getting a new place seeing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how things are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> knowing what i like you don't like but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now it's pretty much just solidified </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that i'm not leaving this because i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna charge out the ass if i want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> move </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like a minimum of like two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> years to like stay in one place two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> years yeah and even then if you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> moving like the amount like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that you paid in that first month that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that if you split that across two years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of rent yeah you'd be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way overpriced oh yeah i think that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i that's that's one thing right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about like uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> living in japan that i've i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> personally never understood for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> longest time but i think finally now i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i do understand is when people say like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> man japan is such an expensive place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but like when you think about it it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like no it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like because you know when when i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh japan is such an expensive place i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think like getting out eating out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like drinking and i'm like no it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> relatively cheap but then you think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> all the bills six months worth of rent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in the first month kind of [ __ ] i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe yeah it is a little bit ridiculous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and expensive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean you can live frugally here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's uh it's not too hard to live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you can live cheap it's it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not a problem i mean convinies you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> live offline yeah oh my god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we can do a whole episode that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically the best thing about japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no matter where you are you are in with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like a hundred meter radius of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything you need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like no questions japan is the only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> country where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the word convenience store actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lives up to its name </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah because it is actually one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the most convenient places that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> god i love kombini so [ __ ] much man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not even the food the food's amazing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you expect this like if you go to a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gas station in any country in the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and you try and convince me to buy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> something that's been cooked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in that building yeah i would rather </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like just get salmonella like i'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna risk you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just seeing what they give me you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i mean like yeah those nasty hot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dogs that have been on rotation for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 20 hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least but the one thing that like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> thought was just like the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> genius thing that japan does which i do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not understand why every other country </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't do this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is the fact they just have like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> printing machine in there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so no one needs to buy a printer or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> buying you can just go to this place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's probably within like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know 100 meters of you 200 meters at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most max yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you pay like 10 cents or whatever and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you can get a printed a4 copy of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever you want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because no one needs to print that much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] right no i've never needed to print </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more than like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one document expensive right and it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dries </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as well so you might print one thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's gone dry yeah and i feel so bad for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> admitting that i've done this but in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uk uh and university </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when we had to have a printer i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> printing a lot of documents i used to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the ink was more expensive to buy on its </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> own than just buying a new printer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah every time i ran out of ink i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> bought a new </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> serious printer that's like 200 iq move </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because bear in mind right this is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time when you're university right where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're losing 20 pounds which is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 30 bucks at the time it was like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> big deal right like i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't get any money i can't afford </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to lose 30 bucks that's like 10 instant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ramens dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like like like two nights out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah if i'm good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so i would go to like the charity shop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh and just like give it to them and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every single like month on cue i'd come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in with a printer and just the exact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> amazon basics printer and give it and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just thought like i can appreciate this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so much now that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in japan if you want to print anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't have to buy a printer you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't have to [ __ ] around worrying about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which ink cartridge mats with your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> printer yeah you go to the convenience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> store and you print it off and it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it makes sense and the best thing is is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that like you know if you do need to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like print out like a document or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything you can just be like oh i can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do that but you know i can also buy like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a drink </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah i can stock up my fridge yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's all there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i can pay my bills you can pay your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bills </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can pay your bills at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> convenience store yeah that's wild to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't anymore because that just takes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time but i did it you just did directly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it was a novelty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because i think the best and worst </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> part of japan to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that it's like a dichotomy it either </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> works exceedingly well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> too well exceedingly optimized always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just a hundred processors to do the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> simplest [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no middle ground nothing here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> works okay yeah it either works </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exceedingly well or it just doesn't work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all i think it's normally like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a public demand right convenience stores </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trains everyone is using them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 24 7. we want this easy as possible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all that it all works flawlessly yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think where it comes into play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mostly is with like government agencies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like big companies that have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> higher ups that don't want to change </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> things very fastly yeah and if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> thought like companies in the west don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to change things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> my god you are in for like a surprise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most japanese companies haven't changed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> since like the 70s because because not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only do they not want to change things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> even if the person before them dies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like well they didn't want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> change it and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> really don't want to like you know step </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> on their toes even though they don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exist anymore you know it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> we've got to keep everything the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> way it was that's been working the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> problem though is that japan has such a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> double-edged sword </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in terms of like maintaining culture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it works </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's maintaining tradition it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very traditional in a lot of ways like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man look look i'm looking at japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> web design </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god oh my god man i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i take it for granted how good we had it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like i didn't realize that i cared about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> users i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i i when i was interning i was in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> web division department because that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> what i measured in at uni right so i had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go around fixing basically like clients </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like old websites </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and like anybody who like ever did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything like html or css related can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> relate to this but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i almost had a stroke when i looked at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the source code and i saw a table </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm like that's something we haven't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> used since like the early 90s like not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is like early 90s type of web </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> design and they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> still using it today yeah yeah i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> think i've seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a single animation on a web page in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no like there's no graphics at all it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it literally looks like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the first like windows iteration like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just it just looks so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] cluttered weirdly enough the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> best web design i have seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is like landing pages for new anime yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah yeah yeah that's it that's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah good websites that i've seen i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like damn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> these javascript for this [ __ ] jesus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before we move on to the logistics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i want to talk about staying to the car </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to thank the pros </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how good the [ __ ] food is oh my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> moving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> moving here from england oh my god where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good food is you either it's you you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> either have to pay a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or you have to cook it yourself it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> every everything here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tastes good it's it's it's just true </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you never have a bad experience in japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with food i swear to god that's like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> difference that i tell my parents the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in in the uk i don't know about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> australia but when you go to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> restaurant </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not a gamble it's but it kind of is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like you don't know if it's going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay or amazing and it's always a coin </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> flip you just don't know and you have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go to find out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> oh no that's 100 how it works in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> australia right because there might be a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurant owned by a guy who has no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> idea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what he's doing doesn't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about the food but in japan it is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guaranteed no matter where you go you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> will get good food yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you are like never like you never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> overcharged </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> either like you always pay a fair amount </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and when you are overcharged </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is like the the taste and experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is worth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly exactly i remember saying very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> harsh words to my mom when she used to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i'm like how dare you give me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> these this bland food all my life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when this stuff existed how many times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> must i have beans and toast mother how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> many times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> can a man eat beans and toast i actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> still like it like when like when the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> combini food here is better than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of the restaurant food you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> find in british restaurants i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go to yeah i'm like man there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> something wrong with me there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> something wrong here man so that's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> insane thing is that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know if it's i don't know if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> japan's the only country that's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's cheaper to eat out than it is to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cook your own food it's the same thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in thailand i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because at least in australia like jesus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> christ </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> no one goes to restaurants because it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i don't want to gamble </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if this 25 pasta is going to be good or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> not like i'm sorry i'm like i'm not that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> rich </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'd rather just go to a supermarket and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just cook a five dollar pasta i'm here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in japan and to get like a single lime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a single lime i paid two dollars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah two dollars for a single [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the something i wish no i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> think anyone's mentioned that on youtube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people don't tell you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how expensive it is to cook here yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i don't know if this is just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe in america it's different no we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> not from america and i know the prices </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for fresh food in america is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> ridiculous yeah but in the uk i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know about australia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the uk like buying ingredients is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so incredibly cheap nobody </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> eating out is not so much you do it for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the food it's more of like an experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with your friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no no it's for an event right it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> luxury yeah don't do it because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you you have the money it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like you do it for a reason and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you like if you speak to someone in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> uk and i know that if you say like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eat out every day in the uk everyone's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the [ __ ] wrong yeah because like in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the uk you don't eat out alone yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's very rare to do something like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eating out alone in here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more people eat out alone than cook yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then cook </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know because it's just more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> convenient and it's cheaper as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because my god vegetables here meats are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay but vegetables are so expensive and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like and the biggest offender in my mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> lime's terrible peppers you know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> normal bell peppers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah in the uk i distinctly remember in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like aldi or even like tesco </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like one pound 29 right for a pack </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of three bell peppers right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like what 1.60 yeah in japan for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a single bell pepper which comes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> with its own packaging </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like 180 yen so if you want to have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three bell peppers so that's that's two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> bucks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> six dollars for three bell pepper are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you [ __ ] good can we talk about the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> biggest defender though which is fruits </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my gosh roots </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i like okay they're good they're good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're good they're amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but jesus talk about overpriced yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know there are like japan has this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like weird obsession when it comes to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fruits where it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh it's from this you've got a massage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> oh it's from the specific prefecture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that specializes in that fruit therefore </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you want to buy an apple from like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> aomori prefecture which is like known </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the apples it's like you know a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> regular apple like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know about the uk but at least </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in australia it's like if you want like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a freshly ground </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we don't [ __ ] know where apples come </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from like good quality like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> home-grown apple </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> it's not proven but uh it's it's like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> wives tale right </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> right like you know you'd think that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're in the age of science right like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i thought that people like knew that </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the amount of like uh just weight </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> we're one of the most healthiest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> healthiest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> countries in the world and yet i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's something ridiculous like one in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> three people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> diet it's crazy and i'm like you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> need to diet because i and and that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know that whole thing comes from the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> whole ridiculous standard of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone's here everybody needs to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> bulimic otherwise you're not considered </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> beautiful yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like going back to the fruit thing i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i remember uh me and aki </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went to like this new supermarket that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> opened up near our place </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> of them in there and it was like 400 yen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like okay a tad expensive but not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bad right next to there there was a pack </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of another 30 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cherries but they were from like ibaraki </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or like somewhere local </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was obviously some kind of brand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right guess how much these cherries were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just going off japan experience like 30 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> bucks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay so like three thousand yen how much </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> yeah two thousand five hundred yen right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> twenty five bucks yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think of uh six thousand five hundred </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> jesus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for thirty cherries homegrown </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay like what like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i saw like i was really tempted to buy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just being like i swear to god if one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cherry doesn't give me an orgasm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's not worth it yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i know right it's not worth it it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good it's good fruit don't get me wrong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but is it worth the [ __ ] premium </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that i'm paying right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't think so i don't think so like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's already </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a luxury just to buy regular food yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah regular non-branded food exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like who is buying this that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's my biggest concern it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what kind of fruit elitist is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> buying these like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 60 dollar cherries from like down the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> road you know five-star michelin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] cherries like what who is buying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and being like yes i can definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> taste like the homegrown quality in this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the it's the [ __ ] elderly it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the grandmaster this is hidden health </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> benefits </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this is low gmo this cherry will fix </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> your erectile dysfunction </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this isn't from america it's homegrown </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> going back to you know uh people who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stay thin in japan i think one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> preconception i had is that i would just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> move to japan and because oh god because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> japanese food is so healthy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just like lose weight automatically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'd like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> zero efforts lose weight automatically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> most restaurants </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have a menu surprise surprise and uh if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you just pick the unhealthy option you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> read the unhealthy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah you gain just as much weight i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> think the whole preconception is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i think especially when it comes from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like americans yeah yeah it's just it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not so much about like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the actual fact that like the food is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> healthier and i'm sure like if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like constantly go eat out of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> traditional japanese restaurants that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> sort of traditional japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> food yes you're probably getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> healthier stuff yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think it just seems healthier </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when compared to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> americans because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the portion sizes are just smaller that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and like the whole conbini all that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff is definitely not healthy oh no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's delicious but it's not it's ordered </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the problem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything's delicious so you just want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to keep eating more and more right right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think we like we mistake it as like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> food culture thing as to why everyone's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so thin here but it's definitely like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you live here you realize really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> quickly it's a lifestyle thing yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they walk so much most people do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exercise unless they're super busy with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> work and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean that's already draining enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but i've noticed that people don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really like eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> lunch or breakfast much here it's like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> light bite most of the time unless it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a business meal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's when they'll eat lunch but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> most people i think just have like an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> onigiri or like a small snack </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a calorie mate right and even then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think most people are just too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> exhausted by the time they finish work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they just have something just because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they need to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and then they go to bed where i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean when you're a youtuber like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm i i eat because i'm bored and trust </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me there is more than enough stuff to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eat here that is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> terrible i'm sure the amount of food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they just like are used to eating as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> well is greatly different to like any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like standard of like a westerner right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh no like for me when i whenever i have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a sweet like uh like an ice cream </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> everything is sweet here yeah everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything and it's so good like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally i hate sweets but now but now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when i go to a company i have to get at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> least one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> snack or one suite but like the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing i can't forgive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially this is not just japan this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is all asian countries yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sweet bread oh i i just think they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i i i i can't speak of other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> asian countries but this bread this this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> country's bread is a joke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh yeah this is not like it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bread like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no half the bread that you can choose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like i have not seen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a single bread that is like multi-grain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bread like just brown bread right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> minding anything but white bread and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then sometimes like bread with custard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who the [ __ ] wants bread with coffee </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay i i [ __ ] with bread </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i [ __ ] with it because i grew up eating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that [ __ ] but and then there's other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff and it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the uk the one thing that i realized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now i took most for granted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was just a loaf of bread yeah right like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel like the one thing that everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feels entitled to in the uk is a loaf of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bread </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it is like the staple of the house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right it's just everyone has a loaf of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bread you just go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] tesco's waitress at most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can even get the cheaper option </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still a whole loaf of bread for like 80 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> cents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah 80 cents adm whatever how many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> loaves of bread </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how many slices of bread do you get in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the you get like 12 like 12 times you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> get a full load like this yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay japan you get half the [ __ ] loaf </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and they've cut it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get six slices you get six slices </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's not only six slices it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a brick of [ __ ] like it's not even a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slice like it's too thick to make a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sandwich out of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so thick that the toaster struggles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to toast it all the way through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to like put that [ __ ] in for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 10 minutes and it's like lightly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> brown and i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i just want toast yeah i think bread has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been the thing that i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> missed the most if not that cheese like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh don't get me started you can get good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cheese here but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the same block of cheese in the uk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a kilogram of cheese i would pay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like two three pounds right so that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what four five bucks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here if i want like 200 grams or 500 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> grams of good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like actual cheese not that god-awful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] they have here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like 15 bucks like and i'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> paying that much for cheese because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just can't like in my head </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean it's a bigger struggle for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like considering that australia is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> known for its cheese like all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> supermarkets in australia have an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> aisle specifically right here you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to go to a specific </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> specialized supermarket for foreign </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah and it's like the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> processed [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> americans they'll have they'll have like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 100 meters of tofu </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't you worry about it they'll have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every every single tofu imaginable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll have like it's the same tofu but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like it's like instead of zero zero </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> zero zero f on the color grade it's zero </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> zero zero point one x </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one shade whiter literally like the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they'll sell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like cheese no way get that [ __ ] out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of here we don't need cheese you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what's [ __ ] when we have more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> variations of natto than we do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean not that i'm complaining but yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know how you handle natto man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i just grew up with a man like this yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm open to things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i'm i i think i have a really good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like palette i can eat anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but natto i don't know what the [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't want to be that guy but it's an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> acquired taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you know you can say that again you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i feel that i'm pretty international </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm open to trying new things there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a few things in the world that i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just don't get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> natto is one of them yeah i'm sorry to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> betray my own country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> durian is another one i'm sorry guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i've never tried right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but i've always wanted to what what are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> some like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i guess what we're talking about what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are some misconceptions about japan that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you think you experienced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because for me i know i thought for some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> reason i thought i was going to eat way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more fish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by just being i mean in comparison i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guess i do eat slightly more fish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right uh but i thought fish was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to be way more of a factor in my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> life than it actually is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know and i i feel like if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to avoid fish in japan it is so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> easy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah like it is i mean i think that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comes from the whole fact that like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because there are more foreigners living </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> here like they were just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially like even in between the four </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> years that i've been living here there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so many more vegetarian and vegan places </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> open now like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's incredible especially in tokyo but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah no i agree like i love me my fish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't get me wrong i'm saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but i'm definitely not going to eat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sushi every week like most of my fans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> think i yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i can't eat sushi every day it's like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a like nice little treat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> right right i know what you guys doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about if i could eat sushi every week i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would and i do most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> mostly before pre-quarantine like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to like this dollar sushi chain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i [ __ ] love it because you get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you get better sushi than you do for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> paying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 30 quid oh yeah i think i think sushi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] dollar and it's [ __ ] amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and i i do eat quite a lot of fish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mostly because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eat sushi a lot and when you cook at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> home um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know because i love [ __ ] salmon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah and and because there's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> much fish like in the uk sometimes you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could get like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> meat that's been like like seasoned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> already yeah and you can get like fish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and supermarkets here that's already </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pre-seasoned everything so literally all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you gotta do is open that bad boy up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> throw in a pan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you've got an amazing taste yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so good i think it's just habit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> basically yeah because if you don't have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the habit of eating fish you could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's there's so many other [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you could eat because there's it's so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> readily available pizza potato that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know what pizza potato is come to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> japan it's amazing it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i [ __ ] but that's the thing right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like sorry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i think most people think that like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we just you know all the receipts it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just like sushi is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like you know as as obvious as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this is going to sound japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> food culture is just so much more than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that like it's so much more than fish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i have consistently had the best italian </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here as opposed to there would be some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there would be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone italian out there just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> cringing yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know going to italy it's no contest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right but compared to the uk where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it was literally like again it was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> coin toss right you'd go to a place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the pastor was like god awful like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's the saddest carbonara which you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how can you [ __ ] that up that's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pasta 101 right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you come here and i feel like you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always consistently have like a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> experience with every kind of food right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i mean i mean you you know this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> chinese food in the uk is a joke </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're not gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> any kind of cuisine you can imagine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> except maybe like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> american food like really like dinosaurs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like meat like really like ribs and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's hard to get that but you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm fine with going to america or going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back to the uk and having that myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every now and then yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for the for the overall trade-off of all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right consistently i get better meals </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah right right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is there anything else that like haven't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> met your expectations or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> haven't met your preconceptions yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> would i want to know as like a non-like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> president right or like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> non-japanese this is gonna sound dumb as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] right and i know it's gonna sound </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dumb but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i like i knew things were going to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> difficult that i couldn't speak japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or read japanese more so read than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything i feel like you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason you can be fine not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> speaking japanese here but if you can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> read </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you're in for like a storm of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> trouble because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are so many things and and i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you you all can agree on this if amazon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't exist here and happen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god if amazon didn't have english </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> settings here i genuinely don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i would do because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the websites here in japanese like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know if they've done this on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> purpose </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or due to the old interface they do not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> work well with google translate it's all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going back to that like 90s web browser </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't know how to design their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> websites it's not user friendly so if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't speak japanese or read </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese you're kind of [ __ ] yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the google translate does not help no it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't help it can help you like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like you kind of feel your way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> through but you cannot tell what the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] you're doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the only reason we've been able to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> through it is because we've had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> uh friends we've got a company helping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> us yeah that makes it so much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> easier for you oh yeah joey shout out to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your friends yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> joey helped me a lot when i when we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> moved here like help me out doing all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i had to go to the town hall with you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like fill out your papers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the thing right is that you think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> big population areas they'd have like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of english support but i think they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> said like if you come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on these certain days like setting up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> internet do you remember how much of a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hassle that was good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i remember that uh uh au right they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> say they have an english location in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shinjuku oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a [ __ ] lie no no their english </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> location </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that they have a tablet which can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> call a call center </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that can translate the person for you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of but not really but that's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> closest thing did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get that fox i didn't even get to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> guy on the tablet i just turned up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on the website this says this is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> last location and they were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no and i'm like what do i do how the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] do i get internet yeah yeah help me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i luckily i had a cousin who worked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in japan so she could speak japanese she </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> helped me through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so much and i don't know what i would do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> without her yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know same with you yeah you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> needed like you need a lot of you feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a baby </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i genuinely don't know like how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there are some foreigners here who can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even speak english </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah somehow at least on their own and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how the [ __ ] did you do that because at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> least they have a lot of english words </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of english options sometimes yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you speak </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't speak english [ __ ] i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know what i don't know how i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like english is hard enough as it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you know if you can't speak </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then i i think you're pretty much [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um if you can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> real positive message coming out of this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> episode no no no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that's the thing a lot of people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't talk about which is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how hard it is to live here actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> live here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> without speaking japanese because coming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like we said it's so different living </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know working here and just live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> visiting here as a tourist yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's there's a world of difference </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's so many little things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like for example registering with a town </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hall yeah how the [ __ ] am i supposed to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do that if i don't speak japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they don't they don't speak </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> english and all the forms were in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese yeah the forms they tell you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that you need to do that within two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weeks of moving here yeah or also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in it's just in japanese just learn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese in the two weeks that you hear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the only reason we knew is because the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lawyers told us hey you've got to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like if we didn't know that i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> know what i was getting i would have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just carried on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you need a dedicated agency just to help </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you with all the admin stuff because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> mean i can understand the language and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> still have to like learn from like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cousins who leave here that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh [ __ ] i have to go to the town hall </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and register for like my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> address and like my health certificate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and all of that [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i i never had to experience that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> living in australia yeah i never had to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experience that while visiting here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right so it's just it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> overwhelming and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i it's like massive kudos to people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know japanese or even don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> english </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah again i don't know how the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they do without the help of an agency </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so to clarify you can live here if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't speak any japanese or if you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> learning but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i i think if you're somehow coming here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> alone without anyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> helping you it's going to be hell yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah cause it was hell enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with multiple ways of us having help </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right it was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i felt so bad for joey the amount of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> times i have to ask him for help i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like he [ __ ] hates me at this point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every day every day i'm coming over with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a form </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what does this say and then also like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until you figure this out right if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> miss a package in the post </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get a little form through your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> mailbox that's all in japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and and you need to figure out how the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] you're going to reschedule this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> luckily you know there's a like i found </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a way eventually which was like scan the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> barcode with like whatever thing you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it'll take you to a website use </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> google translate to translate it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then hope that the translations are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rough enough where you can like figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out what's being said and that's what i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do every time now but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for the first week where i didn't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that every time i missed a package i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hey joey can you uh call them up and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> tell them tell them i'm gonna be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> homeless it was like a month where like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was calling up these guys more often </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for his packages than i was for my own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> packages </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i felt so bad but i was like i need the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> package </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and again like if okay let's trace it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i hate being like nice to a trillion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> dollar company like amazon but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without them and like the english </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you can just change it to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> english right yeah they also they have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> support in english i'd know because i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had to like return items and stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's literally no different from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> using like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> amazon in in the uk except maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes the translations don't work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one for one but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you can pretty much find what you want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you can type it in english i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we basically furnished our entire yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my whole house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> using amazon yeah because like they they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have like a japanese like here which is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> called nitori </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> um but you know you have to go to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> store you have to register you have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> put in your address </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and all that stuff takes like 20 days to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> deliver anything yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah how crazy is that like if you want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to like their version of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this ikea here as well but it's very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expensive uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you buy stuff from nitori which is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like their version of ikea like you said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's like there's a lot there's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of waiting time like 20 days i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for some products </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and i was like i can't wait 20 days </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for a bed like i want to sleep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like what do you what do you mean let me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just live on the hard floor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what am i going to do and yeah just uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> also any advice to someone moving to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> please make sure your house has ac </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before you move in because i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i had to pay i think it's like two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> thousand yeah your previous tenant like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> jacked the [ __ ] he [ __ ] gutted the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whole place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he took everything he took the light </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bulbs who leaves who takes light bulbs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah that's a frequent occurrence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll see like going into a new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apartment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there won't be any lights right right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to apply your own lights like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when i move out of a place i'll leave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff that i think is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> super generic that like you don't need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to think about like i'll just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i'll i'll leave the bulbs in if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i have like a door mat i'll just leave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the door mat like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever they can throw it away if they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't want it yeah like they they took </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything so i removed everything i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> moved in with no ac </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was getting really cold and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think there's one cosplay video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where i was like [ __ ] freezing during </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and i was getting like naked for it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> not only that but you were in like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> coldest routine yeah yeah yeah exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tommy yeah the time which retains no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just like before you move just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> please before you move into an apartment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> please make this sure there's ac there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> otherwise that's going to be a huge cost </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you move so i had to pay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 2 000 plus dollars for two ac units </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> jesus and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know what i'm gonna do with that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if i haven't moved back to the uk like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i just can't i guess i'll bring it right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uk could use ac </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but like okay let's see you pay for an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> apartment right you you paid for the ac </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in that apartment right like that's part </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of your bill whereas i had to pay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 2 000 independently so that you could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> argue that my rent has gone up yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just like dumb [ __ ] like that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't consider no so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay one thing that was different for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is how much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i thought i would go to akihabara versus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how much i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually go to akihabara yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because every time we haven't gone since </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you guys moved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i know i mean i'm so sad like because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like when every time we visited here on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> holiday we'd spend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> half our time there or something like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that of course going to akihabara it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the proper way to be experienced i'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> proud to admit that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i it was like it was like the like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine every single anime convention </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> shoved into one it is like a mecca of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weed it is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the holy land for yeah but then you move </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here and you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man akihabara is not only a long way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> away but you can get a lot of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> better online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for cheaper if you can figure out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese not only that but there are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just like cities that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just are better for like all-round like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experiences like that's why i love like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> ikebukuro yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because with akihabara you only go there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for anime yeah if you don't if you want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do something else then it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not the best place to go but if you go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> somewhere like ikebukuro you can still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shop for anime figurines you can still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go you know go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go down autumn road exactly exactly go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> go to the animate there which is also in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> akihabara yeah but then you could also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> go to an izakiya afterwards or go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> karaoke or you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of other things it's a lot more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> varied there's a lot more variation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> outside of akihabara than um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if you want just not to downplay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> akihabara though no it's amazing don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no like you every weeb should go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> akihabara yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's an experience you'll have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> spiritual awakening when you go dark but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it is crazy like the first time you go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there yeah holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> why this is what i dreamed about three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sega arcades </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right next to each other why it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like information overload right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you get blasted with so many lights with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so so much [ __ ] just around you you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know where to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can spend an entire [ __ ] day in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> one store </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah yeah easily because if you want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to look for deals right and figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've got to pull out the whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shelf because they they hide [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way in the back and sometimes you might </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> find that one deal that is like all you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] talk about yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when i found that one thing for like 20 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> bucks yeah if you want to get a figurine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like the best price </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you got to like create like a google </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spreadsheet all right this store has it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for this price but the store down there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so you gotta like keep track of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> everything yeah and then you ultimately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> realize that it's not it's cheaper than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on uh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a price like it's way better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to buy online yeah even amazon here like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the figures are way cheaper sometimes in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the stores which is like weird see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because for me like amazon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> itself was just like a huge revelation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because we don't have amazon in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> australia yeah wow you don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what to think that we have how does a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> country function </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> amazon we have ebay and we have like our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> own version of amazon one called </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gumtree which is just like oh we have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> gum trees yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i used to like sell sketchy stuff to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that's like the craigslist of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> amazon though yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty much but like gumtree i'm pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> sure it's an australian company </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and like so we have gumtree and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ebay and that's it we don't have amazon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so like when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know back when i was living in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> australia and talking to like american </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like youtuber friends who were like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i just got that off amazon i'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah about that they're selling it for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three times the price on ebay does that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> count </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i hated it so when i moved here amazon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whoa holy [ __ ] it's gonna arrive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> deliberately yeah [ __ ] hell yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the thing about akihabara i feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's more of an experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than the actual you don't go there to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually shop you go there for like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> akihabara experience because yeah like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember one of the biggest things that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i noticed going to akihabara is that you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> can walk into one shop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you think it's like this single </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> store shop and you're just gonna come in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and come out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it turns out to be seven </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] stories </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of shops and then you waste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> five hours there because there's so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff in this one shop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so tightly packed yeah oh by used </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> figures as well like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> their version of used here is is a joke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no everything is immaculate it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> immaculate like i feel bad now because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when i use something it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] messy as [ __ ] i have books that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have like one single folded page or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something that i like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> placed it down wrong and that that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just unusable here yeah they'll be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> damaged goods </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looks very used and i'm like what the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] used in the uk is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if it's just barely functioning yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's fairly functioning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know it probably has like an std i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't [ __ ] know what it's been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whereas here it's like have you opened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the box yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah which is which is [ __ ] amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how connor you found probably the only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> used product in japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was your fridge oh yeah can we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talk about that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i'll let you tell the story but it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely was not in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immaculate shape you know we had spent a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of money on moving right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as anyone knows moving is very expensive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> moving to japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really yeah yeah yeah people people </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> yeah exactly now you know much of much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of the advice i can offer </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> of the first of our kind we were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of the first youtubers to be able </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to move here for being an annie tuber </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically we got so good at being a weeb </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the japanese government allowed us to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> continue being weaves and we're being </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> paid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they gave us a visa for being a super </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] weeb </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah that's pretty much that's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> a you know we're the anomaly we're we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the exception </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah in terms of i mean aki technically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was you know no she was she was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm saying like we're one of them yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of course yeah no it's it's kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> incredible how i mean i felt the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way with argue but with you guys as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that like wow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like attitude has gotten to that point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now yeah yeah yeah cause like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know even like three years ago </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it was [ __ ] unheard of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah right it's like oh yeah you talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> about anime on the internet for a living </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah good luck staying in your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> country for the rest of your life right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like now it's just like an actual </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> viable like career option if you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give back more than you take out yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no reason why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i guess a government agency would not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to have that job there right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're giving more money and you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> not doing any harm and you're respectful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like why wouldn't they want you yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's been really humbling to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be working here officially yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing anime youtube and it's it's been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> really weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um especially talking to people who work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the companies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what i mean yeah it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> directly yeah how do you feel like your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> careers have been affected after moving </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean i'm i think mine's like increased </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> dramatically because now i do have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> access directly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to a lot of these like yeah productions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know i knew like a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> people in the industry quote unquote </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> while i was living in australia industry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> industry but like it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a completely different story when you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> move here oh no exactly because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most of these japanese companies don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know what the [ __ ] email is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no no and they they need they require </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you to meet interviews oh no no like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah if you're going to do business in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japan you need to have a face-to-face </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> meeting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no email no [ __ ] zoom call no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> not even a phone call it's like you need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to come to our office and we need to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make sure that you're a real person yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly so it's it's it's it's all very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> traditional here so to do business with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> any anime company which is why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know things move so slowly is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to follow the tradition you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have to do that face-to-face meeting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> they call a meeting for any [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reason yeah exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> somebody sneezed in the office when you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> discuss whether this is a potential </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> anthrax injection get hr on the phone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean career-wise i guess for me the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> biggest thing is that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i just want to experience something else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and also you know maybe learn another </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> language </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah although it's it's painfully </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> difficult to learn japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> um i just think getting more life skills </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> can can only be a plus right like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if i continue doing what i was doing in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the uk i was doing a lot of voice over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which sure i could probably go and maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go into that when i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah for some reason i stopped doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> youtube but i think i just want to learn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more skills in my life well i'm still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> young as well right and while i'm still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> open to doing things and putting myself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah and i think if anything from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> my career definitely like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that benefit of hopefully learning more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and making new connections with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know maybe not the industry i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know what i'll go into but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean we've definitely made connections </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as well just from being in a company </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> under </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not even in the anime industry just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> lots of industries you made people with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that you never knew that you were a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of creatives right yeah a lot of cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like i think the biggest barrier is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the language barrier yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese really needs to fix their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> difficulty curve because you go from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] playing animal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crossing when you're about to do the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eternal on nightmare </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like like katakana and hiragana is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just playing animal crossing and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> suddenly you're doing like a no hit um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no hit run in dark souls or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when kanji gets in and you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty much what the [ __ ] is going on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is not the difficulty curve i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> wanted and the problem is with like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> kanji at least not problem i mean it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really beautiful like the system of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> writing i've come to appreciate it more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and more but it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if you don't understand a baseline </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> amount you just can't read anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because the moment you do you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like what's wrong welcome to the past 25 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> years of my life right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and it's like it's not like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> know if i was learning french where i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can sound it out and maybe like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i just can't like i'm like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that thing and then you're like oh i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know what this kanji is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> turns out the kanji has five different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pronunciations and meanings </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you don't know which one's which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you you just have to know that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just [ __ ] that's that's i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what's the most difficult right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is that like japan is like an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> anti-phonetic country right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you just have to know it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's why it's so difficult for a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of people i mean like i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i think i we know a lot of people who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can speak japanese but have not even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> attempted to learn to reject no no no it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a completely different ballgame you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like even like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me having learnt it but pretty much my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> first language </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i still struggle with it every now and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then it is like a constant learning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> process for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and like thank god that my mom did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whip my ass to like loner when i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> little because jesus christ my life has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a million times easier that i can read </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it and understand it but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the one time when she said you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> appreciate it when you're older yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> did actually appreciate it when you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> older thanks mom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you helped build my career essentially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah everyone said that with welsh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't quite pan out i mean i appreciate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the culture but that's uh about as far </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as a usefulness </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but here's the question i want to ask </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys how well now that you've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experienced living here for what like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> eight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> months essentially seven eight months </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> now how long do you intend to stay here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um that's a good question i i think i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> lived here long enough to know that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't want to live here forever right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i think there's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at least right now and how japan is a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of stuff that i just like don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> gel with yeah yeah um i think i can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely see myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i put a lot of time though yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because i i've lived here for eight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> months it feels it's felt like i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lived here for a month </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right i haven't even reached a service </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> close to my final form </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like i want an anime reference i know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we've hardly talked about anime on this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> podcast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but uh yeah i mean i still like i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i want to explore japan more i want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> learn the language way more proficiently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than i have now um i want to take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> advantage of it way more and i want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experience japanese cultures more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the one thing i the one thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one target i've set myself i should </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> say is being able to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like have a conversation with some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the businesses and you know going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of the office parties </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually being able to participate in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the conversations and everything like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um that's like my goal when it comes to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> learning you know yes same i just want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to be able to communicate yeah um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and learn a bit of kanji right learn the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> basics just so i can like figure out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what the mcdonald's menu says </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i mean like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's uh i can definitely see it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like a second home to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right like a place where maybe i can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> easily go back to it months periods but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think like when i'm like 50 or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever i think i'm gonna miss the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> how because i think i've been you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i've been really ingrained in british </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> culture of like how friendly and open it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i really like that like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> especially in wales you just rock up to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a pub and you can speak to anyone there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah in the small pubs in wales like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> love that and i kind of missed that a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um and i think yeah i think i i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> know i mean i'm eight months in maybe in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a podcast in a year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we'll talk about it and our minds will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have changed yeah i want to live here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> forever right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah i think i think because right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now i feel like a foreigner still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right and i think that's probably never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going to change but maybe at some point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'll finally feel like i can call this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> place home yeah yeah it might smoothen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> out a little yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably i imagine it will unless i get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> arrested and convicted of a crime that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't accused of then i'm imprisoned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for 100 years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but you know what's the odds of that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before we end the podcast yeah there was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one story i wanted to end on which is um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it it completely shattered what my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> preconceptions of moving to japan would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um and that was at one of the company </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> parties that we attended </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with uh book walker in geeks plus and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know kadakara in general </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was to do with my fiance sydney </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so what happened was you know we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> went to a company party everyone got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty merry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then we went to uh a bar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> afterwards right i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of people from from the company </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some some pretty high up from the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> company </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then we started singing karaoke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> together and so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sydney being the drunken little weeaboo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that she is such </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> she's such a weirdo unlike us unlike us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she went through her weeb phase right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> she went proper cringy weeb face </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unlike us i i just i love sydney i love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you should watch this yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> isn't she like kind of the face of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the cringy weeb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> according to the instagram </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so we start singing karaoke and she </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> starts singing the anna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and hannah and me and god were like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the [ __ ] are you doing like you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in front of a lot of important </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people in the company and she starts she </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> starts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bailing the [ __ ] uh and honey and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hannah ending </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then the [ __ ] businessman start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clapping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and cheering i start singing along </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and i i know i'm just sitting there like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we were both shocked i couldn't believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i was seeing i looked at connor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm like is this our slash it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> already happens right now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> are we living our 2007 tumblr posts yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh yeah yeah so like i i moved to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh yeah i was i was in an important </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> business meeting a business party </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then we started singing the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yanahanna opening uh ending even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then everyone started clapping and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> cheering and it was amazing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like this this is so surreal right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now it's literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that happened post right it's like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's great because i feel like when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you do sing stuff like that it's never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're never like oh my god they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to be like us they're like oh my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> god they care about our culture that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so cool they really do yeah and i guess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i guess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what i want to end on which is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's you know we started on the good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sides and the bad sides of japan but i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> think they really do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> care about our culture they're really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they really care about learning more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they are open to foreigners there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of barriers that come between that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i guess one of the biggest things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can do is learn japanese because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's such a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they love it they love it if you speak </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese they love it to them it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you've made an effort to learn that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i mean and you know likewise right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like if somebody comes over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like your country and they can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understand your language like that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah oh yeah if you could speak welsh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in wales like you're immediately like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like love because like what people in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wells welsh can't even speak whales </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> welsh people can't even speak well right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's i can imagine it's like one of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> those right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i think like you said right all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> differences aside and all complaints </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we have like at the end of the day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't think i've ever spoken to a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> person here who's been rude to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> no and everyone has been super nice and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you might get stared at or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything but that's not a place of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> aggression or anything they just they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just don't see it often and yeah at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> end of the day they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really really nice the positives </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely outweigh this oh 100 yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean i i'm just british right so to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like one percent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one percent negative 99 positive i only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> see this right that's what your raise is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> british </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly but overall it's it's an amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> country and i'm glad that we have </SPEAKER_03>
