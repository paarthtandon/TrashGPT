<SPEAKER_01> question for you connor have you noticed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that since you moved to japan you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> start bowing for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything no but you know what i do do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i do anime reaction noises </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no i do the same thing as well yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're thinking what the [ __ ] that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> weird as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why would you do that like yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay this is why it makes so much sense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now right because whenever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they ask me for like anything at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> supermarket i'm like it's caught off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guard right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah you know i'll see myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it makes total sense why they do it in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime now now because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i've noticed when uh japanese people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you're talking to them they need to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> make it known that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they're listening yeah so they all like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in in england people just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of just stand stand there or just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nod japanese like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> hi hi hmm and i've started doing the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same thing as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever someone's talking i'm always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> having to make it known that i do that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in interviews and people are like can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just shut up for five seconds and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like the opposite japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all right oh yeah i guess we're putting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that at the beginning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's the intro go ahead take it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> away take it away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what's up you naughty neanderthals </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> so let's just let's just pick a letter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just roll with it well welcome to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trash taste the show where we talk about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a trash taste and everything else in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> world i'm your host for today joey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and as always we're doing this now we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> probably doing this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay hello so this episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh i thought we would maybe talk about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something i don't know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's going to get a little too personal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we'll try not to go too personal route </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know to go back to the whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how we first started talking about him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and how we got into anime we've already </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> done an episode on that yeah we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> already done our origin story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but how did we meet or how did we make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> our first i don't know how to say it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anime friend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that a thing i don't know okay so i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> have a question for you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay to start this off because we talked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about our anime origin story like how we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got into anime yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but when you guys were anime fans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did you have any friends in school or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how did you guys deal with that because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i was a closet anime fan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i was a complete closet anime fan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for all of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> school but yeah but yeah i think that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a british thing though like i got i got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> rinsed for playing video games so like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> imagine if i came out and was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this i like this i like animations this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is my new thing now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i like these drawn two dt's can you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> believe i got mocked for playing video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> games in school and now it's just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the accepted past time right i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> got so much [ __ ] for that that's weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because in my school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> video games were quite normalized was it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just your school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe did you no no i got rinsed to my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> school unless you're playing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> fifa or cod there was and i still got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what like i would be sitting in my room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in university playing some rpg </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> hoping that nobody opens the door to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> discover the fact that i was playing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was playing jrpgs i think if i came </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saying that i was a massive jrpg fan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where i was you know playing persona 3 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i probably would have gotten beaten </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up as well but i got so much [ __ ] for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> playing runescape and i still to this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really i think i love runescape i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> remember some videos popped up in my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> recommended recently and i had a great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> time watching them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i got because in my school i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think my my group of friends we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> more so than not i guess like the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nerdy group of friends yeah so we so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of my friends from high school got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me into games like like runescape </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like starcraft uh you know other just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like land games like civilization like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those games back in the day but when it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> came to anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i had a really tough time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i was literally the only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> asian kid in my school oh no same way i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was the only asian kid in my school with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like any amount of asian </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i'm not even like full blood asian </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's just like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this boy's a little bit oriental </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's rice what the hell yeah so i i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i was a closet anime fan for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man i want to say like majority of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> high school life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then my group of friends who got me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into like starcraft and runescape i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like okay you guys are nerdy enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe i can try and convince them to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> watch something and i convinced one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my friends to watch ava </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh so i was like why ava that's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> really the uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> gateway anime i would think of don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know maybe because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was recently re-watching ava yeah and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> thought okay this is probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> normie enough no that they could maybe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> be kidding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recommending ava as someone's first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime that could go one of two ways </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and there's no there's gonna be no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> middle ground either he's going to think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is amazing and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he's a fan but the thing is i didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> want to get them into like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> naruto or one piece or dragon ball to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> start with because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we all know if your gateway anime is one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> piece </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> naruto or dragon you're gonna be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> announcing all you're gonna be talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about for the rest of your career so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> hey man i don't know man i mean i got in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through naruto </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i mean i remember the point you got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it i got it i got it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there there was there was the point when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i would only watch shonen and i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly the exact phase you're talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you figure out that huh there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> outside of shonen that are pretty cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in this medium </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and some people i guess just never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> figure that out i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> naruto fans are like the british with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> food it's like no no no potatoes is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> all we need spice what is that about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what is about what is it about like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously not all shown in fans but a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of shonen fans who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as as you said like get into say naruto </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and yeah just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exclusively talk about naruto's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what is it i want to know what their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mentality is right with anime where it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like do they just think that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything that's not naruto is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hentai like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like no no there's no in-between </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's either shonan or just like straight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> r18 [ __ ] they're like what is it what is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this high school romance [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't want to feel i want to feel i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> want to feel one emotion and that's hype </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm like show jokes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it must be the thing of like i get it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause the type is [ __ ] but like just </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> like yo e3 it was crazy this year every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game every game i'm hyped for every game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they don't play any of them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like the next modern warfare yeah but in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the moment there's like a bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> news article about the game that just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> came out in e3 they're like yeah i knew </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the whole time the whole time yeah no so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like my anime friend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i got so there was a group of them i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like me and maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'd say like six or seven guys who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i used to like really really closely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> hang out with in high school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i got one of my friends who got me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into like starcraft </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i got him to watch ava and i i wanted to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> try that just with one person i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to like bring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a whole group of people into the guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> group viewing so i kind of was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any meaning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i got you watch ava and he was like okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'll give it a go </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> i like anime and i i was like at points </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> and that was the moment where i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> oh gateway anime are important </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> there was boys before us these are the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> og boys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> do you know what the do you know what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the name of our like this is going to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really cringy but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that we had like a group name what was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the name joey it was the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we were called hbk because we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> did you guys ever play handball in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> school i think that's an australian </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think that's an australian thing so in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> australian schools we play handball but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not like the olympic sport handle like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> school grounds handball but usually most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kids in australia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> stop playing handball by around like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sixth grade right so it's very rarely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you go into middle school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and play handball we played handball all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the way until high school graduation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we were the only ones and so from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nowhere we were called hbk which is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> handball crew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and we were through with the k you were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the cause and and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not like and and it was just out of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nowhere one day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just the other boys in our year just saw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> us playing handball and they were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hbk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we're like what the [ __ ] what the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] does that mean we later found that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> man handball crew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and normal people would be like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's [ __ ] cringy yeah we were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> handbook hell yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i think i think handball is something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i've only heard australians play in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because oh yeah i've seen obviously he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> seen handball in the olympics and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> everything like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when we had like a british team like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when did they play that i know right but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's completely different to the olympic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sport yeah so so when i saw handball </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because i'd always known handball as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that thing that you play in school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like four white squares and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you kind of like yeah it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> basically just tennis but with your hand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and a tennis ball and in really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> confined space so when i saw handball </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the olympic sport i was like what the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is a handball no it's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting to hear you say going back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the anime um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> conversation that we were having because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't even make my first anime friend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> till i started youtube like that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> years after i started youtube i i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talking to other people who liked anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> until </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the age of the internet where i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally started talking to other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people who reviewed anime </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> drunk yeah he'll try and show you shitty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah i've done that i like the fact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that you had to wait until he was alone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and yeah because because these other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boys were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> discussing you know how good the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> alabaster rock in one piece was and i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i don't think these boys are ready </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> these these guys are like these guys are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> one level one thief and these guys are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like level 10 mafia boss right so i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like let's let's let's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> experiment with joe joey's like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sensei who sees the hidden potential in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that one student </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like i i can teach you the way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're ready to learn you're ready to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> upgrade so did he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so did he enjoy more of that kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> show afterwards so then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so then that was the point where we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> him and i we found out that we found out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> from each other that we're into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> those kinds of shows or we're okay with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we're just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into each other yeah we were just into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> those kinds of shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because after we finished kisses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're both just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i gotta i just gotta let you know bro </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now that we've had this [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> journey together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i'm like secretly into these shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> he's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every single moment of this story could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be like a coming out to each other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and he was like dude i'm kind of into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then from there and from doing this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> on purpose </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and dude i'm kind of injured </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and yeah so so from then that point on i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i kind of was i became a lot more open </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with like my my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> my your your my my trashy taste in anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> joey's like yes i'm hentai sexy i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> right are you purposely picking words </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this is free real estate all right like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go go for it but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but that was the point where i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> slowly realized oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if i'm closeted then yeah i'll obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have a lot of fun you know just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of enjoying this medium for myself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but yeah there's a whole other enjoyment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you get someone else into it as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i know i remember the first time i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> able to have conversations about anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with other people and that was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so liberating for me yeah that i had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all of these years enjoying this medium </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but have literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nobody to talk to it about yeah and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i made youtube videos to be like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if i can't have anyone to talk to about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just gonna talk to the void </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and hopefully someone will listen and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember having the some of the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> genuine conversations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> online because it had to be online back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then um about shows that i liked and it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i just felt free yeah yeah because um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i don't know who your first friend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in uh in like the anime youtube sphere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for me it was uh probably horden reviews </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the people from what's potaku we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> going going way back then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think mine might have been misty your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yours missed it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of them were just like fleeting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know mutuals you know yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'd say you guys probably the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> proper friends that i i made outside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know yeah because it was it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> strange for me because i'm i'm the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> complete opposite when it comes to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> my friend circle on youtube where you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would think that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i would be very quick to bond with other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> antitubers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> once starting an anime youtube channel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah weirdly enough for like the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> two years or so i was only friends with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> gaming youtubers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but that's also because i was doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of gaming stuff alongside stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and i think it honestly might have been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> misty that was the first like proper </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anna tuber </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was when i discovered this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> entire community of antitubers i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh my god i'm not the only one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah there are other people who do this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff as well and then that's when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> drift away from more of the gaming stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and focus on what my channel was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> actually about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah i remember i i realized we get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comments sometimes that are like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> me listening to the podcast and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that guy sitting next to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's great because i remember i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing my a levels i remember listening </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to paul taku actually oh i'm about to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> listen to it yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i would do my i remember i have this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> distinct memory of you guys arguing i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what but i was doing over a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> things yeah i was doing my math a levels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was and i remember just listening to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it and i was like man and i want to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be in that and talk to them i don't have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> friends i want to like talk to friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about anime because i know even at that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> point when i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 17 i still had no one to talk to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about anime yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh i didn't really make friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until university but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i got banned from my uh anime uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> club facebook group because they were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talking about like housing abridged and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like oh [ __ ] i voiced in there i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> said in the comments i was like oh yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i voiced </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it and then they banned me they thought </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> would someone in our university you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> first year </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> anime clubs and also this is the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing i hate about cinemas in the us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that they love to [ __ ] commentate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on what's happening in the movie i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cannot stand that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i can't [ __ ] i can't stand especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> u.s cinemas </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> the worst thing was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i uh one of my exes i went to the cinema </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with never watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh a movie in the cinema before and i </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> didn't know that because how do you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not like on a tinder buyer right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then she like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> shouted during the first five minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i was like okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in my head i'm thinking all right let's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let's not make this a reoccurring thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then like two minutes later shouts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> again and i'm like please </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> please don't do that please i'm i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> british </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can't do this i can't be seen with you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're making a commotion in public </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> japanese citizens man because like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's no okay okay go ahead go ahead oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no no i know how you feel about japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cinemas all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like for uh there's a part of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that i like and there's a part of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that i don't like the part that i like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about it is that people aren't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shouting their rotten tomatoes reviews </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no one says anything no one says </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> anything i like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i like that because especially if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a movie that you need to immerse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yourself in like a [ __ ] paprika </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for instance it's like i wanted to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just quiet and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i want to get into it yeah but the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh the bad thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that i went to go see the connor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> super movie right which is easily one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the funniest anime movies i've ever seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and i but i felt really bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> laughing out loud because i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally the only person laughing out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> loud in the cinema </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and every time i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't think that was supposed to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> funny did anybody else find that funny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've had similar experiences in uh thai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movies or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> going to thai cinemas where i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching your name entire cinemas and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know if it's just a cultural </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> difference yeah but there would be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> times when they were laughing and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would be like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what why why is this funny and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they'd be a really funny joke and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'd be the only guy laughing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like am i the [ __ ] here am i do i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just have a weird really weird sense of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> humor i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel so bad because i was like is is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> anyone genuinely not finding this movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> funny like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> am i the only one yeah i i hated it i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been going to the cinema at least before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kovid like i was going like pretty much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> every week </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> and then also one really annoying thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right when the movie ends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right the credits come all right see you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guys i'm off </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> like okay i want to know who did and who </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> like film industry is aware that people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> have to stick around to the chris that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> when sometimes i can live yeah when a </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> there you go you got it you got the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> money you got this just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then it's just nice just to absorb </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> i mean you guys know we have to stick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> around for the craze can you at least </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> make it </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> people who stand up and go as well yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like yeah join me it is it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> freedom so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's like the trust system </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that japan runs on like buying alcohol </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm slowly breaking it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know i i've just the more i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know i say the older i get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i the more i i you know have less time </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> time and i'm just like nope i'm not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> waiting for your credits yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so speaking of gaijin car though have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you guys ever used the gaijin card </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like funny situations should we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> explain what the gaijin card is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sure you should probably go for it go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for it i mean i'm sure everyone knows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what the gaijin card is right but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically the gaijin card </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is gaijin means foreigner yeah in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the guys playing the gaijin card </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically means you get away with [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that japanese people wouldn't be able to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get away with in japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they forgive you because you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> supposed to be like a mindless foreigner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i i try not to actively like take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> advantage of eggs i feel like it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fair for me to like use </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know being a foreigner yeah you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because everyone goes through the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> struggles right life's hard enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i mean there's some stuff like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apparently you're not supposed to eat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and walk here right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah i i do that i i don't like if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i if i have like 10 minutes to get to my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> train and i haven't had breakfast yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm grabbing that sandwich and eating it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't throw my [ __ ] away i don't make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a mess so i'm like you know it's fine i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always wonder that that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then why is it that a lot of convenience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> store food is so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> perfectly packaged for on-the-go right i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know right and it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't eat it on the go though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> onigiri just that that's that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> basically a rice sandwich </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's that's meant to be eaten as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're walking along but yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> no you you know what you're watching no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one gives me looks or anything or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything like that it's just uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i'm told i'm not supposed to do this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but [ __ ] i'm gonna do it anyway but the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff i wouldn't dare do i like playing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i like doing the reverse guiding card i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like playing the gaijin card and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> immediately after i've committed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the act just bust out the japanese just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> psych reverse uno </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> can you give us an example of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> situation uh so an example of a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> situation i'm trying to think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what would be i mean you know something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that right like not allowed to eat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the go or like not allowed to eat on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the train for example </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you know uh i would you know as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you said like sometimes i'm busy and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes i gotta get something down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before i catch the train </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i would eat on the go and people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would kind of you know just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be like whatever um but then what i like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do just to [ __ ] with people is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i like to i finish the food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then just just because i love seeing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people's reactions to this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i finish the food and then i pretend to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get in a phone call and i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talk in japanese as loud as i can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just because seeing the confused phases </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being like is he gaijin or is he not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> guided </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't even know anymore is my favorite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] past time i've i've done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the exact same thing but just when i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in thailand yeah and you know when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know when people gossip about you in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> their native tongue you don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they don't know that you understand them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you just want to flex on them to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] i know exactly what your mother </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] says </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you better watch yourself [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh dude i've had so many experiences </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like that especially when you're outside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of tokyo where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're obviously not used to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> foreigners um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was in the supermarket once uh with my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sister we were like really really young </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe like i was maybe like nine or ten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> years old oh wow um and we were just in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the the aisle that has all like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> snacks and stuff right because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese snacks are like the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> best and we were just picking stuff out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was this kid probably around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the same age as me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who was just like staring at us from </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> dad would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my dad used to say this one threat it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like a legit threat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right where like if i did anything like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bad in public he just like grabbed my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> ear and just whispered being like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brought you into this world i can easily </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> take you out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> my dad won't remember that but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> specific like it's an eight-year-old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm sorry for that 101. me and my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> brothers so we had three brothers right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so it was wrestlemania like oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we must have fought i must have been in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this fight like three days of the week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right right um was it actually fist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fights or was it like oh yeah it got to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the point we would like actually start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like full on punching each other jesus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah we hated each other i love him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> now i love you guys but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then it was like [ __ ] because oh god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so many fights but yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> my dad had this thing we called it like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's probably gonna kill me if i say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this but he had this thing called the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> murder stare </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like you know when you started </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] up and he would look at you and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he's like bro you're one step away from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like losing everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right now it was the look where you he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was like don't do it don't do one more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll end you love you dad by the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because i was an only child so i i had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never had to grow up with any siblings </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never had to share anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but yeah that was i had a fairly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> uneventful childhood because of that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think in 2020 we call that privilege </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i got bullied so much in school so i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just started just [ __ ] punching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i guess yeah if you get bullied at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> school you probably have like a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people yeah i mean after i started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> punching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> back and you know actually getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fights people just left me alone because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they knew if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they would go for someone else who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> wouldn't fight back yeah exactly should </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i just challenge them to a chess game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i should have man that would have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely worked against kids you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> should have challenged them to a chess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game and then the moment you when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just punch them in the face </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like double down on it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so bad i don't know what stories i could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tell if you want any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i'm just trying to think like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when was the i did you ever punch anyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like full-on punch someone yeah i have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what reason uh because this kid it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> always dumb as [ __ ] in the sky </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's because this kid in my high </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> school was giving me [ __ ] like he was he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was the bully about you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but the thing is he was that one bully </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you know how some bullies are kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> popular with the kids that they don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bully yeah this kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because he bullied everybody like every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> single person everybody [ __ ] hated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and of course eventually he made the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rounds and the next target was me for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but and obviously going to a high school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's a 99 percent white boys and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm the only one with a non-white </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bloodline of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah he's going for the low hanging </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> fruit yeah yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> he would you know say all these like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> horribly racial slurs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at me and stuff and uh and just one day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he was just really and i didn't mind the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> racial slurs it's it's when he got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> up to my face i hate it i hate that so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> much there's a difference between a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> bully </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shouting across the playground yeah at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you yeah i don't mind that stuff yeah it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was just fine right because that shit's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> easy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but respect my personal space yeah right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the moment you cross </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> into my personal space that's when the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hands come out yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i i never punched anyone in my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> up until that point yeah and i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay there's only one way that this kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is going to stop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he's like and in my head i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> doing a kaiji episode where i'm like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i punch him i'm either going to die </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or or i'm going to come out of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> alive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> joey's like death noting every action </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> bad this is like the total opposite the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> way i used to think about it i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just just punch and figure it out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> oh no no no i was always the person who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was like okay what's gonna happen if i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> down this route it was like a visual </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> novel right it's like punch or not punch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know i don't want to get the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> band i want to get the bad end right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so i was like oh so i was like there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very good possibility that if i punch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm going to just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> batter just and i was like but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this kid was just relentlessly just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> shouting in my face and just you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like and then the moment he started like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> pushing me around as well that's when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's when i think i just snapped yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah way all back and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> knock this kid in the chat like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brought the [ __ ] bucky move on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> knocked him in the chin and he fell down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> on the ground and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he just kind of walked off and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nobody in my ear [ __ ] with me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's good that years and that's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> okay oh this all right that was the good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> end that was good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like when you know i'd never recommend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like fighting back because it can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally like it can go like two ways </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one you can get your kick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like spit on each other in school and it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was that was the stuff that bothered me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the most like yeah you can call me [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't spit on me what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i hated high school did you guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have this i don't know if this is only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an australian high school thing but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the last year of the 12th grade like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally the day before graduation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i forgot what it was called i think it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was called like year 12 free day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where basically the 12th graders for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> last day of high school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they can just run around the school and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> do whatever the [ __ ] they want i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had something similar in our school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah what you guys didn't have but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> our school took that free day literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where some [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> happen like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we somehow uh uh we you know the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it started off quite innocently like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you know putting lube all over the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stair rails and stuff like that and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> another one was going into one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> teachers offices and filling his entire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cup </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh entire floor with cups full of water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that he couldn't like go into the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into his thing like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it got too far when uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one of i think was like a group of boys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they got one of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> teachers cars and i don't know how the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] they did it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think it was driving a mini so it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like relatively small car </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they somehow put the car on top of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> one of the school buildings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like on the roof and i mean that's too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> far but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just sounds impressive honestly the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> engineering what are the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> logistics behind this you know this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> kid's going forward </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i wasn't there to witness it but imagine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just walking to school and you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> walking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know along the school uh like wall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and you just look up and there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just a car </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sitting there i'm just like oh how did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that get there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the news or some [ __ ] no no no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> this is like this is quite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> frequent that sounds like a scene from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some american what do you mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this sounds like a scene from some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> american high school movie that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch and you're like oh this is so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] stupid this one never happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know i don't know if my high </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> school still does it but that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> newsworthy in the uk i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that would be yeah of course [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> hell no even the even the girls schools </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> would go crazy like that as well just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it was you know it was the last </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> last day of high school right yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> had a problem with this guy i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> realize why he was doing this to me but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pissed off one of his friends and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he you know trying to act big i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think he actually wanted the fight he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was just pushing me around </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> that and he just dropped and i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh no i'm going to be in there i'm going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be in a lot of trouble </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't even think i did it that hard i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just thought i saw it in a movie once it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> looked really [ __ ] cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i saw bruce lee do it once i could do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sir who gets hurt by getting kneed in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the face </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so he pushed me and then i think he was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> going think i was going to arrow for a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> push and i just went like douche </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then he just like dropped for like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> five seconds and i was like oh [ __ ] are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and he was like yeah yeah i'm fine and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think he was so embarrassed that he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't tell anyone right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then he came in the next day two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> black eyes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> wait how did you get two black how wide </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is your knee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so we came in with two black eyes didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> tell anyone but all my friends knew what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no one said anything it was like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> one week where i had like three fights </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right no one did anything for me the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rest of my school life it was great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone everyone was nice to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you had more fights in that one week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than i think i have my entire life i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> think i had more fights in that one week </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than anything this is like fight club </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because it might work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in my school it was it wasn't about like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> getting into fights it was about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> who did you know like if you're cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with x person if you call it that person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah people don't [ __ ] with you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know if it's because it's like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> small town thing like my and like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh it was such a small town thing yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the teachers often like forgave the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shitty behavior because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> more often than not all the teachers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were friends with the kids parents right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it was kind of a thing of like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't do it again don't do it again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stop like you need someone in the face </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> every single time it was like don't do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it again don't do it again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know it wasn't like a proper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> punishment right now i mean you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it is what it is right i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really care now i've i dealt with it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> myself did you go to a boys school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no oh okay so maybe that's the aspect of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a ride because i feel that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boys will be more willing to get into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fights if it's a co-ed school because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're trying to like impress </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the girls i never wanted to i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> wanted to play my game to be like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> there was like one guy who would like he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he didn't want to fight me he didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> want to fight me because he i think he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> knew that he'd get hurt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so he would just oh like i said he would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spit on me and anytime i try to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fight him he'd just run away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so what can i do right it's like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> one [ __ ] who like kites amazingly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> come to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> his torn game's like on point yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah he just kites you and he's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kidding me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> then he would run to an area with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> teachers right and i can't [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> punch him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if any 13 year old 14 kids don't fight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not a good solution </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean i i was just lucky that i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> freakishly strong for a 12 or 13 year </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> old as well that helped a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah um i don't know because for me i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always gone through life being like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay physical physical like interaction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is always like my last choice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah i have that now but as a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> kid i felt like it was my only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you weren't the hard way yeah i mean i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm glad that i was angry as a kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because now i have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> zero anger at all right i never get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> angry about [ __ ] now i'm so glad that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just got that [ __ ] out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know i don't know if that's how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anger works i don't know if this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> science </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not sure about that it's not but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like because i've dealt with so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much anger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in in my past right i've been able to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like really like </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> like you feel </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> british emotion yeah you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything can mildly frustrate you and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's just that's just the way </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> title is why the hell are you here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> teacher that's </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> completely uncensored you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> full nips and everything if you've ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought about getting with your teacher </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's basically the show okay that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically that's basically the manga i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> need no more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you might need more because the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other manga that they have is tempuru </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is illustrated by the same guy no sorry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah illustrated by the same guy who did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> grand blue you know grand blue i do know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i do yeah so illustrated by the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> completely same guy just different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> writer but essentially as the name </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> suggests it's about this kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who has these really dirty thoughts but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> he wants to be a good christian so he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically goes to a temple to get rid of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> horny on mean christian thoughts but the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> problem is that he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> becomes a monk at a temple that is full </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of hot women </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that doesn't sound very monkey today </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> did that happen to you mom i want to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a monk i swear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah this was the real reason that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> became the market hoping for that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> scenario that sounds pretty good yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and but like the thing is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's illustrated by the same guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the grand blue the type of comedy is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly the same as ground blue so if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you love the like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really vulgar visual comedy that really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> made grand blue funny like tempura is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly the same way and the added bonus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's way more hot girls in temperature </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> than ground blue so guys i'm i'm getting </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> in my life but i've not just been a monk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> once right just saying that is so cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to me this is just part of buddhist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> culture so in buddhist culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um normally when you want to give your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> family like good karma </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone in my family has been a monk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like twice in their life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> once when they're a teenager and once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> an adult so you you you become a monk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> once when you're when you're like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> teenager we call that being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> um and then there's you become like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> full monk when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> become an adult and that's when you kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of hit like your early 20s </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay okay so yeah so normally a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people just do it like for like one or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two days </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we believe that it's good karma </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah um i remember when i was about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 12 or 13 i i was a monk for two weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then afterwards when i was about 22 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 23 i was a monk for a full month jeez </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah because i cuz i because you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> told me stories about how you were a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> monk for an entire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> month but i never knew that you did it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> twice oh yeah yeah i mean i mean to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not part of like being a buddhist and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know trying to get i was trying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was that good little asian kid i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to give like my family good karma </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i honestly i honestly like wrapped the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experience because it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not i'm not joking when it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally the life-changing experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for me like well that was it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was me before being a monk and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's me after being a monk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because normally people just do it just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh just to impress their family and just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give give their family good karma </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i i told my mom if i'm gonna do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm gonna go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> all the way like yeah yeah like there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's some temples that you go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that don't take it as seriously and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i went to a [ __ ] hardcore temple </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you know we didn't have any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> technology </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah uh we had to okay so here was my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> daily schedule </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay so i would have to wake up at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> around 4am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that already sounds like torture that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> already sounds like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like have have to be ready have to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> completely ready by five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay and we didn't have any beds we had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a concrete floor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and one little pillow to sleep on oh my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> god and we had like the thinnest blanket </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the world which wasn't so bad because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's thailand but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when sometimes when you're sleeping in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the middle of the forest because there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would be times when we just go out to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> temple in the middle of the forest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it can get [ __ ] cold the temperature </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drops to about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> two or three degrees sometimes and and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you you just have this like tiny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> little blanket on a concrete floor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to keep you warm right so we'd have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> wake up at four get ready by five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then we'd just be like meditating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and praying for a good two three hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> every day and then afterwards we would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go out barefoot go to like whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> village or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever area around the temple um and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people would just donate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> donate the food to we would have these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we would carry like these little baskets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um on our necks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and people would come over and they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would you know donate food or whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they want to donate because we believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that if you give to a monk that's good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> karma as well yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so the food that we got donated that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what we would eat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so we we would walk around for a few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> hours for the entire day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah for the inside or was it like just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like enough or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean you you get what you're given </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you had no choice about what you could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> eat you could eat basically what you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> were given did you ever get anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like super nasty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no i mean it's it's i guess in in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> mindset you're not like picky you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh really a snickers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really no because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the whole point of being a monk is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't okay you don't care like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you eat to survive i guess if you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> caring about that that's like no that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's defeating the point of being a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> monk so you you get what you're given </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you live the simplest life you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> possibly live and you basically eat to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> survive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you get one meal a day and you gotta </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you gotta be okay with whatever you get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> given so we would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> eat at around 11 to 12 o'clock and that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would be our first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and only meal a day it was it was easier </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're a kidman because kid amongst </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get two meals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a day okay yeah but when you're an adult </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah when you're an adult when you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grown up burning through more calories </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nope </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you got to survive on one meal a day and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> afterwards you could there was no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cheating so after that you couldn't have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any milk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or any like liquids that had calories </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you could only have water water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or some kinds of fruit juices and and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and yeah it was it was very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i i don't know really how to describe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the experience because imagine if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every every distraction out of your life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you just live the simplest life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> possible you don't need to enjoy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your food you know you you get you don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the pleasures in life but at the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time you just kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're okay with everything because you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to be okay with everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i remember for the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> week of being a monk it's [ __ ] hard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is so [ __ ] hard to reprogram your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> brain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to not only be like okay how do i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> distract myself with my phone how do i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not check twitter how do i not watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> youtube videos how do i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> be okay with my own thoughts and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and and it's so hard because your brain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nowadays your brain constantly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> constantly looking forward to something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it constantly needs something to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> distract itself um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the first week i was just you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like a drug addict right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm sorry i should tweet give me a tweet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm i'm sitting there trying to meditate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and my mind's just going out a million </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> miles an hour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i haven't watched tv in in a week i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> haven't seen a screen in a week it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's very very difficult but the more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time you do it the more you kind of your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you realize that oh this is this this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these are all just distractions like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can be completely okay with just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and your own thoughts and just doing the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> simplest things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and life activities and then when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i got to that point i kind of just had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time to just reflect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on my entire life because what else what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> else what else are you gonna [ __ ] do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when you have nothing to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but literally think back about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every decision that you've made in your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> life and the way your mind works </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know you know when you're sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like lying in bed at 11 a.m and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> brain reminds you about shitty thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about that embarrassing thing you did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you were 12 or maybe like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that time when you punched a [ __ ] kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in front i'm like oh my god i got him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so just just imagine your entire day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just being </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that just being like uh i wonder if i'd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> made the right choice at this point in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my life and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what happened to me was that i kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just reflected on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every every little decision that kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that kind of led me up to this point in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my life and what it made me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what it forced me to do was really think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> huh am i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really happy about where i am now like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's what's my life going to be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i when this monkey ends and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was at a really bad point in my life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before i became a monk which is kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why i've really wanted to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> commit to the facts of being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if if i was going to be a monk i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to go all the way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get the full detox yeah get the full </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> detox you know because i've seen some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> temples you you walk in and they have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like a flat like a 50 inch flat screen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i'm like this is the monk channel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we only have the mung channel this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't seem very monkey to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know about that except paypal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you turn the tv on it's like a live </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stream of like a different temple and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> then like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> praying exactly nice nice content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so so it forced me to just reflect on my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> entire life and it forced me to really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think about what i wanted to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after my monkey had ended so it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> truly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a i don't want to say [ __ ] it was a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spiritual journey and i really just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> discovered i mean i thought in this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> instance you can because it but it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because people have talked to me about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> how they have you know how they've had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> similar experiences when they just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shut off social media and everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that yeah and i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know no you're already yeah bruh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> bruh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't even know get on my level yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get on my level bro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like you didn't have any board games you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't have any cards to just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> play around or all you just had was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yourself and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just it i can't really convey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how alien that is because it it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> alien for me as well it was a part of me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that just a vision </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know because as you said the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> only thing you had was just yourself and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> your mind right yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> all i could imagine was just monk gone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just sitting there and just thinking up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> a funny jokes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm gonna roast these noobs when i get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> back good roast oh no no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that that's that totally happened as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well that's when i was a monk that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i uh thought about hmm there's a series </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are you serious i'm totally serious </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> because i was i was just walking around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um walking around one of the thai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> villages and </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> you know just zoning out sometimes i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reached this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> point when a lot of ideas just come to </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> you just have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just have nothing because it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just a void right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just giving your life a void and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because you give your life a void </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it [ __ ] changes you i i don't know i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't i don't know how else i know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i totally get that like back when i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still doing youtube stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> um i would i went on this like camping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trip with a few of my friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we went to this area that had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely no reception whatsoever oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> whales </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah we went all the way to wales no we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> were just in the [ __ ] middle of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> nowhere in australia with no reception </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and we would just went camping and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's no reception </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i couldn't check anything right like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> couldn't like i couldn't even like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> message you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is like a light version yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> basically just like a dieting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah a diet version of it but i i kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a similar experience to that but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only like for that one day and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first couple of hours i [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hated it because yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i was getting those you know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> drug addicts like i need i need to know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who liked my tweet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but after a while like when it hit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> around midday i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i eventually was like you know what this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is actually really nice like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the world is beautiful that's why i love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to the cinema like it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> no one can like be like why don't you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> answer your phone like yeah in every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other situation like oh you should have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> answered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> still in the cinema for some reason i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was like understandable have a nice day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you ignored my text for three hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> understandable it's just like a void </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right it's great like i love it you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> literally ignore the world for like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> three hours and just have fun yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's why it frustrates me when the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> void gets pulled back to reality when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone in the back is just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shouting yeah yeah just being like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i forgot this reality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah because especially now i think i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know the internet's i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> has reprogrammed my brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i don't remember i don't know if i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just have adhd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i didn't always felt like i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this easily distracted it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> subconsciously building patterns in your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> head though like because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you you've trained your brain to check </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> twitter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and so you'll you you'll have that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> moment and i'm sure you've all had it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you're like you opened twitter you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> closed twitter and you opened twitter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> again and you're like why did i open </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> twitter again yeah like i didn't want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> open like i literally just refreshed my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feet two seconds ago i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i didn't want to do this i just didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you check twitter on your computer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you realize there's nothing nothing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you checked it and then you immediately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> check it on your phone why am i doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this i wasted time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the same concept just going to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fridge seeing nothing there closing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sitting back on the couch and then five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> minutes later going to the fridge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like it's like food's gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> magically appear in the freezer right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so i i mean it was it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it was an awesome experience for me i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i don't you know if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if that's not something that's if not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's it's a little bit it's not an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> experience for everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the question is though would you do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> again um i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would do it again possibly maybe not to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this extreme because i feel like i'm in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot better place in my life i'm a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> more privileged now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no i mean like like not not just not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just that but like mentally yeah i'm in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot better place in my life as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um so i don't feel i would need to go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that extreme again but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would i want an experience where i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of just remove myself from the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> world and just give myself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like a short detox yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's it's like a detox from the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> mind yeah this is how i feel it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i i highly recommend people doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that it sounds really cheesy because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people will always think of that leo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> some some crazy californian gap y'all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like going on a gap yeah i took a gap </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> year to thailand became a mom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly that right i was just like shut </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you probably went to the club every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> night like shut up yeah so that's why i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't really like to talk about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because whenever whenever you say yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's unpretentious it sounds pretentious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> people give you that look to be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> why because it makes it sound like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like a vacation for you whereas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it was probably someone's life right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah that's why it sounds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or maybe or maybe it sounds like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because maybe some people think you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> went through it just to brag about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like later on yeah yeah exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fact that you've you you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really talk about this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i never talk about this i remember i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dragged you i dragged that conversation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> out of you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we were like really drunk it's in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> singapore like three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> years ago i think i just drunkly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> offhanded mentioned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so were you like were you ever angry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before you were a monk because i swear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've never seen you angry what's up with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that gun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean i i i've been angry before you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> get mildly frustrated you don't get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even when you're angry i'm like dude you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know if you're angry angry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> no like like being a monk just taught me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how to deal with it think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about the whole process basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> process everything right because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when when you just kind of empty your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> mind you part part of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> part of the uh commitment we try to make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that we try to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> learn how we process our way of thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you gotta like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you gotta kind of it's i okay so the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i see it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of like a logic tree right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this is what happened to me when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was a monk where i'd feel certain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> emotions and you'd have to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> logically think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be like why am i feeling this why am i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> feeling this how did this come </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you kind of learn the roots of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically all your emotions and just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anger and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> through that i just on the fly i learned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how to deal with my anger and just and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just i would find another route to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before i get angry maybe i could go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe i could try dealing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with another way which is why i rarely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get angry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and i always you know some people get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> angry very easily </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but for me it's not that i don't get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> angry is that i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> have different ways of dealing about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> than of course than shouting or [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> death i just love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> shouting man okay i don't punch anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anymore that's old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> old connor's gone new connor he just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> wears cosplays and shouts loudly yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah i love shouting i love like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when i shout out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i [ __ ] love shouting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know why shouting is so fun like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so do you like purposely shout to just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> get like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that frustration now before it turns </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> into legit anger or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes if i'm like real angry some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> days or i wake up and i'm upset i'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just go in the mirror </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'll be like come on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i only hear i only see that in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movies right like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> everything to avoid it i would be like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> would shave </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like three times just to make sure it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was perfect in my head but rece but </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> seen the [ __ ] random circulation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah or whatever right my friend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sent me one the other day which was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] insane it was september by earth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> wind and fire oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remixed with crazy train by ozzy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> osbourne </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can remix that song with anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> though yeah but it sounded </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] amazing i was like oh my god i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> need more i need more i have never seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an earth wounded fire remix uh september </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that disappointed me except for the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taylor swift one that was terrible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but earth winning fire goes in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything that we the wii shop one have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you seen that the wii </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shop bro that [ __ ] collapsed bro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i can't do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i've recently fallen into the rabbit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hole of just listening to j-pop that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they sound like anime opening and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> endings but they're not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah yeah like polka dots </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> um it's it's it's it's so many yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like the rabbit hole right you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> discover one that the algorithm is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh oh you like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh hello hello let me let me show you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> more it's going so deep right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that recently i was recommended a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is kind of like a it was kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a vocaloid kind of remix but i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think it was original song but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the video had no title yeah and the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> channel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the channel had no title and then i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> click on it what yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so so it's it's it's not it's not even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like they have a space or something no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's just literally no character for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the title </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you can do that apparently you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a there's a thing called like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> half half space or something and it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> space that uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is technically a character yeah but it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't show up as anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh wow so so but but you can't you can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like highlight it and copy and paste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into the search bar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no interaction with whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> character they're putting down right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so the only way people would have got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is through recommendations yeah and the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video has like two million views </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you click i click on it right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then everyone's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ah welcome to the cult i see you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> diagnosed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i see you have been the chosen one and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's it's great because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're probably going to kill me now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's like mutually agreed not to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talk about this which sorry guys i guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i guess the entire the entire [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the entire [ __ ] internet knows now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but i'm not going to link to it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if if you're part if you're part of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chosen one like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> show me a message if i see anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> linking it i'm gonna [ __ ] ban you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you played me this at your house and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was just hoping one day it would pop up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in my record </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> still waiting still waiting still wait </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like illuminati man you just gotta </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> wait for that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> crappy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> no but that's that's just the wonders of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the algorithm i mean i have no idea how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the algorithm works there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's okay going completely off topic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> here but there's been one video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one video of mine recently oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] getting recommended to everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no idea why it's an eight-year-old video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we've not talked about in this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> podcast so many people have tweeted us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about it i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wow yeah so there's been a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> recently that's been circulating that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> called </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> recently the time of filming yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> recently at the time of filming um it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> might still be circulating talking about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it it's probably going to start getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so i should probably circle back to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the start of annie tube itself you guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are about to get a history lesson here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> go on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so okay so do you do you guys know who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the very first annie tuber is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought it was mr anime yeah that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> my preconception yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean i'd be surprised if anyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching this new because that means </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you've been around for as long as me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the very first anime youtuber is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this guy called </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hard anime reviews okay and he would be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he started in 2006 and he would just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically make he would basically make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> very uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very basic anime reviews with like his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> camera was like up here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> worst angle yeah yeah yeah the kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of like the worst angle you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think of the angle we all start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he he's not he's now quit um it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's funny because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i tried to search him up and see if he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still around and he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> his first his first original channel got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> terminated as everyone's did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back then when they're reviewing anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and his second channel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is called unironically the hard mode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he called it the hard mode and okay if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you search this on youtube you have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to search </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the hard mode no space otherwise you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not going to find it because it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's like that buried within the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> search search algorithm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the second annie tuber was this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> person called mr anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and um he was he basically made his </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime youtube channel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to compete with hard because hard was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the only anime youtube channel around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then mr anime was the second one and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he really at the time he really was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the big faces of anime youtube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i say big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he had like a thousand subscribers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's that's what i mean [ __ ] though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back in the day yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that is big [ __ ] back in 2006 2007. yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then it was after mr anime that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there were like there were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some some other anime channels here and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there but those two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are basically the founding fathers of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anitu okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there we we have we have them to thank </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for where we are now basically if people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the ending to the story then you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> how funny that statement is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i know right so then after a while </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i um i make my youtube channel and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i do i do my own thing and the very very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> first shout out i got </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> yes yeah yes so it there wasn't an easy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way to talk to each other apart from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back when youtube had messaging you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> remember those days remember yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> youtube dms </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> the murdering his family i'm like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well well is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is is this trey sessler the anime man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the same trace tesla </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um [ __ ] i've just blanked in his actual </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> name now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all that's coming to mind is this mr </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> anime oh my god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can't believe i blanked on the name </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mid-story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but um why did you doubt me like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come on yeah yeah i i clicked on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> article and he had his face </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and that was just the just the oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah is is this is this real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like how how i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i had like 50 different emotions yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of just see him because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't know how to react to this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because the more i read </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just the more sickening it got yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the entire the entire story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was that apparently traceless trey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> sessler mr anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had uh been playing around with his </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> brother </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they they were playing around with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> guns as they did on that as they did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> see he had a lot of guns in in like his </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> channel and everything but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know me back then me back then i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> americans guns that's what just that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just what they do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what british people think about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it yeah yeah we literally think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> americans just walk around be like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so he would just have guns in his anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> reviews i just thought that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> completely normal which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know because he was from texas as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well he was from texas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like sling in texas yeah exactly so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was like this is this is completely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> normal this is nothing to worry about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know there's a texan watching studio </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with that gun just like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even even now even now i see a text him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a gun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i just think you know that's that's even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> normal even after everything i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about to experience but i i read the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> story and he was playing around with his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guns with his brother </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and apparently he accidentally shot his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brother and he and he and he killed him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so he didn't the the official story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that he gave was he didn't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> his parents to feel guilt or his family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guilt about you know having his having </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> son kill one of their brothers so he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just apparently he just thought might as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well [ __ ] kill them all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> which is which is [ __ ] awful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> which is which is [ __ ] awful which is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a [ __ ] awful conclusion to come to so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> apparently he kills </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> his entire family and then and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it gets worse because the like the more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> information that comes out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the more um we find out that he was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not only planning to kill his family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anyway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but he was actually planning a columbine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> style </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> school shooting yeah right i i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i saw like this really good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> documentary on youtube i'm sure it's up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rainbot right yeah i think so it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically covers the whole thing but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's how i got all my information as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well where yeah he was planning to do a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> school shooting and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he i did he post about it online that he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was going to do it or something like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that but he basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was on the way to the school and that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when he got arrested yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no because he was he was planning he was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> planning the school shooting for way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before he's killed his family because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think how he thought was he killed his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> brother by accident </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but he was always planning the school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> shooting anyway yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he had he had it all mapped out and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything so in between that he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> accidentally killed his brother and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> killed his family and that's what outed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but he was always planning this and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's this really ominous video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um it was i think it's the second to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> last mr anime video that's on his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> channel that's just called </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mr anime is planning something </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> he's taking a break from any chief i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just planning a new review he's he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> planning a car he's planning a comeback </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but i don't know it's it because he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> talks about anime in that video so he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> might he might have been just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> purely talking about anime but i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with all the information </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i have we have now he's probably now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was [ __ ] scary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] that title was [ __ ] yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the more information that come that came </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out the more i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't know how to process this because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how how do you process the fact that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the people you looked up to and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> respected just [ __ ] killed their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> family and was planning to shoot up a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what what what what'd you do with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that bothered me for uh for for like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for a while and i remember that's this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was the time i was at university and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people were like why why is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why does ghan look like someone just die </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in his family or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i i think the way the best way i can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> describe it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine if you like live in a small town </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you you may be like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone in that small town you might </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not be friends with everyone in that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> small town but you feel like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> small tight-knit community and then you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> find that someone in this small tiny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> community </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has done something awful yeah it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not like beyond words you know beyond </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> words awful and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then to try to process </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> process this i i made the video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is being recommended now it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> circulating everywhere </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though it's eight years old um it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for some reason youtube decided yep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people want to see gang reacting to mr </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime murdering his family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i don't i don't know how that came </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about it's literally on everyone's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recommendation it was on my recommended </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i don't know why like yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> probably not monetized right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no no it's not money right so it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it just goes against </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> everything about the youtube algorithms </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's not monetized it's about a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> horrible tragedy it's about a very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sensitive topic i mean i'm eight years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> old i i think i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> uploaded this before even like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> monetization thing like started on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> youtube or at least before i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> monetized because i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i had like a thousand plus subscribers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> back then so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was it wasn't massive i remember as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i i remember stumbling upon a mr anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even like way before i knew about the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whole anime youtubing sphere and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it was mr anime's review </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on gantz that made me want to go watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> games </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and uh wow this guy's got a bright </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> career yeah and i was like wow this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> guy's like really fun he [ __ ] had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you know how ghetto his setup was he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> he had like a a a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> webcam or something yeah yeah to record </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and he was sitting on his bed and he had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> his lap it was like a notepad oh it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like an apple an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> apple notebook it was like an apple </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> notepad of the script and he was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally just looking down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the apple notepad just reading off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the script and then every now and then i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because he didn't know how to edit his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> videos so instead he had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a remote that controlled the zoom of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> he controlled the zoom of the lens and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just start talking to the camera and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then he just zoomed back out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah no cuts so he was like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember in the gantz review </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he was talking about uh you know the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> acid scene right yeah in the dance anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and how he was like it made me go and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then he stops and zooms in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and zooms really far into his face and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he goes [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then he zooms out with a dead face </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it just goes back to reading it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and that was the review no cuts no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> edits </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i was like yeah i want to watch this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that was quality content back in the day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or youtube i remember when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i started coming out with my videos i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was one of the first to actually just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> use an editing software even though it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just putting images over whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm saying i was like people were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what he's he's using windows movie maker </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> impossible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> wow but uh yeah that's that's the story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the first person i ever in like humble </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> beginnings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's so fun yeah but i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recommend like as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of uh of a topic that is like i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely recommend that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> documentary on youtube that somebody </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> made it's great because it perfectly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> goes through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything about it and at the end of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the documentary i don't know how they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got this footage but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's this the police footage the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> police footage yeah of how he's in like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the jail cell yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah the interview that [ __ ] is so scary </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> man yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and to think this is the guy who founded </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> basically what i do for a living i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i know right right like that's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] scary </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's so weird because i've had a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> con i've had this conversation with a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> few people and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we just think man there's a lot of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's happened in any tubes yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i think there's stuff that unfortunately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know happens in every community yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we probably will never find out some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> really [ __ ] up [ __ ] that people have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> done oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean we've only recently found out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> about a lot of it right right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right i mean you know you you it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> really unfortunate because we don't like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to think that we know people who are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that but if time's proven anything it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i've i've met people and been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> friendly with people who have done </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really [ __ ] horrible stuff i'm sure i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> mean i never knew that you know one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my best friends used to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> punch kids in the face right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean once you look once you look up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and respect a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> serial killer school shooter then it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all downhill from there right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah exactly i know how it feels to see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a police report and being like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no oh yeah i i i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just a mess of emotions it's first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> surely this is fake yeah because you see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it and you're like i've never seen a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> police before first of all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah this could easily be doctored </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then just seeing like all the counts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being slowly like added and you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah oh no oh no this is bad yeah and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> think that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was the first time because i had a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> conversation with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> aiko the the anime review about how we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> should process this and remember him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um yeah i think he just he'll keep the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the memories of mr anime like the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's just he has to view mr anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and trey sessler as like different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people and i think that was the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the first time i i had just thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about the entire process of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having to view online personalities as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in person how they portray this the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> whole thing of like separating the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> artist from the creation yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's and yeah the it was more the fact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that this happened in our small </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> community as well because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> right it's like happening in like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> small back rural town right where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> nothing happens </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i'm sure now in any tube i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> sure there's some [ __ ] somewhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh there's probably some someone doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so we don't despicable [ __ ] that we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know about you know but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it they weren't a figurehead in this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> very small community yeah they weren't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] founding father </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the literal founding the literal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> founding the more the more you say that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out loud the more i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> oh the founding fathers tend to normally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> be sketchy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how how do we sell that the anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> youtube community is like this really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cool thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh the family father's a serial killer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a conversation starter i like to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> think of it of you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's one of those things that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to be started anyway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eventually around that time right it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just so happened that he was the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of the first maybe that's the reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> why nobody used </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> anime in the username until i came up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because people because i know for a fact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that some of my early videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man those comments were just like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime man i thought that guy went to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> jail </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like they legitimately mistook me for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> mystery who would res who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who would mistake you for that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> better run rewind that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> flash back to five minutes ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so but like you know i obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about that news until after i started uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my youtube channel because i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what year was it that he got arrested um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean it was eight years ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think that's the only reason i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember this is because the youtube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> video has been recommended is eight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> years ago so what's like 2012 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right probably yeah something like 2011 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 2012 it was probably just a really bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time there because i started 2013 right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally right after it happened yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't know about it until i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> started it and i had like a decent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> following and i was like oh [ __ ] i can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go back now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like i can't change my name now i should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have i should have changed so what was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the early years of anime youtube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like and like so you that was over like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what well how long you've been new </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> youtube before 12 years did you say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um since 2007. okay so how was the anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so how was the another spear from 2007 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to 2012. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like slow right it was very slow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so before 2012 which is which is i kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of like where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i think you came along um it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the quality was not good obviously um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> as as it is but it was it was it was fun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i i kind of in in a way i'm going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sound so boomer saying this but i kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of miss </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> old youtube where kind of anything went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> always look </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> back fondly at the time when it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> smaller yeah more manageable because it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was more intimate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and you always look back at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that period especially on youtube right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i'm sure you all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> missed the time and you made like one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> thousand you could just talk to random </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no no you're like wow you're so cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you know i remember i made a video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when i hit a thousand subscribers and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> thought i'd made it i thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i thought mom i'm dropping everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> dude i i swear like i've always said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this to people but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the joy of hitting a thousand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> subscribers is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> almost comparable to hitting like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hundred thousand or a million </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> subscribers yeah yeah yeah because a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thousand is just like whoa because a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> thousand is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> monumental it is because it's a number </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> very easily like quantifiable yeah but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> huge because like thinking like wow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a thousand people who like me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because once it gets to like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> million </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's it starts to become something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you just can't really comprehend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like physically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whereas a thousand is like holy [ __ ] i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> popular i'm [ __ ] popular and that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back then it was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was you know as it grew into it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> all about doing anime reviews and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of people had different styles if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you came in with an editing software you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you were just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you were just you were the goat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> otaku and tristan glass reflection </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reflection came along and they used </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sony vegas to edit that video and it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> blew my it blew my mind they used a paid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> price </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah just some of the stuff they could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get away with that i couldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> using like putting images on windows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> movie maker what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it was basically a glorified powerpoint </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i think my favorite anime review </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from back then was this guy called uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> grumpy g-sun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i [ __ ] love him i do not know this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> he's so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good yeah yeah he he's an og and he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't make videos anymore but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what he do is that he'd he'd do anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reviews but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he'd do it in like the middle of some a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> desert in arizona somewhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right he would review an anime while </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like hiking through the dish yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so so what so he was like he was he was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> basically pre </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> casey neistat because what he'd do he'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always start off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> his videos with like uh with like uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> uh with him walking towards the camera </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like the middle of the desert so what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he would have to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that he would have to set up his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> camera </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hike like hike away off screen and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hike back into view of the camera it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't it wasn't like he was hiking a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> short distance he would be literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like hiking over hills and mountains </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes to get to the camera </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and yeah he how long was his intro like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just two minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was just like super sped up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you just see him walking towards the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> camera so you it would be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it'd be like it would be like a squirrel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like scurrying like towards the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> camera </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's like today we're going to talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about berserk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this sounds amazing as well how a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> his reviews he he always had like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> place to go right so he would start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with at the front of the trail being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like today we're going to talk about you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know hunter hunter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then as he's walking he would talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about the show and then usually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one i saw i forgot which anime it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was but he was hiking up this mountain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't he must have like perfectly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> timed this [ __ ] like he must have done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the hike beforehand because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the moment he got to the top was when he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> finished his conclusion on the show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and he was just like i've made it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the top guys and that's the end of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> review yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like that's [ __ ] like all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like thinking back because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thinking back it was it was very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different from what everyone was doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we were just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> huh old man reviewing anime that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty weird but thinking back he was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of his ideas were really cool you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know he's kind of ahead of his time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he was definitely ahead of his time yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's that's why he stands out to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me apart from the guy who [ __ ] killed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> himself i guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no no no not killed himself killed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone else um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah it's it was kind of like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wild west back then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean all of you i mean it wasn't the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> internet the wild yeah what's the so if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the first era right where you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know 2007 2012 what came after that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what's like the era </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um what years are we talking between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause i'm interested </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i didn't start till 2015. so all of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> before that is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i'd say around about i can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember exactly when it was founded but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that was that was kind of like the wild </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> west of youtube where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone was kind of doing their own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> things it was it was a mess of different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then 2012 was kind of what like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where the annie tube community really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> started to form into this one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one conglomerate and i think the big the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> event that happened was probably potaku </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> potaku was huge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah that's the first time i recognized </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anyone outside of you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and i was like oh there's other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people yeah and i remember because i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always i was already uh so we had four </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> original members there was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> holden reviews um jean who were who was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> originally called x disturbed jeans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh tristan the glass reflection and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember what started it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tristan one day messaged me out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> messaging me out the blue with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> youtube dm's being like hey do you want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to talk about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this new anime season and this was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this was before i'd even started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching seasonal anime this was this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this was before the concept of hey you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> can watch anime weekly and be hyped for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> seasonal anime you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yes i'm pretty sure you made a joke in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of your videos where it's like why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would i want to come </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> over the space of 12 weeks when i could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just come in one big go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was a joke you made and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remembered that sorry i completely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> forgot about that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's an amazing joke for some reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that stuck with me and i was like that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a great example i would i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like to come in one go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no no i'm thinking about my thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> process and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my like what the thought process is why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would i want a 12th of an orgasm when i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could just have one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> orgasm in one session yeah right that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> such a good joke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and so we so we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we've made this podcast which wasn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even a podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um it was it was kind of just a recorded </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> skype call </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we didn't know where to put it so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> made the suggestion to put it on youtube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because this was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this was before like it was an audio </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> podcast it wasn't a visual podcast like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this so nobody </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought that putting audio podcasts on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> youtube would work and i just i was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like well we're youtubers so why not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why why not put it on youtube right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i i don't like saying it like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it kind of sounds like it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sucky mundic or whatever but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i would say like potaku was a big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> factor in you know shaping the anime the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime youtube community </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of that time no absolutely i think it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> left as somebody who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know wasn't even interested in being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an anime youtuber i definitely shaped i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think how i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> felt about it because at the time i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> listening to pottaku like every week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i never even i never wanted to be a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> youtuber never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> crossed my mind but definitely when i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got into it i think a lot of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> influences came from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> listening to that so i think you may not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have shaped the generation you were in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you definitely helped shape the one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that came after i mean there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you know a reason why even to this day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> people who are around in the anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah people back then still are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah remember pod taco like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like even people who didn't watch pod </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taku knew pod taco yeah i mean it was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's still a big point in my life otaku </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really really was it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i think back to portage very fondly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> even though it's like ended now and i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> moved on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my life it had he had a big part of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shaping me as a person and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's especially because portugal was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first ever friends i made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i could talk to anime with yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know i mean that that goes all the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> conversation we had at the start but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> holden and jean were literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first people i was able to bond over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and potaku was kind of like my weekly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bi-weekly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of session where i could just nerd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> over and i would just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with your buddies yeah exactly yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> apparently a lot of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looked up to us back then because a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of people apparently didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also have friends to talk to anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without listening and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and so that really i feel like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cemented the next era of anime youtube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before i think i think you came along </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and i think that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was kind of the era of youtube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it was i think it was a last era </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where people could just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make content without a monetary </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> incentive in mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right right right because everyone ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we did we did poor taku not because we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were getting paid we weren't getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> paid for it at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for a lot of it um we we basically made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it because we just wanted two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> projects it was a passion it's it was it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was kind of like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but back then this was before we had any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of monetization yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we we were just we were just four mates </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who would just go go on a skype call </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um and record the audio and just splice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it together and upload it on youtube and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> then i came in when the fat chicks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> started rolling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no but like i i don't think it's too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> much to say that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know this podcast included there's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of anime podcasts now right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> big and small and i don't think it'd be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> too far to say that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know pod taco is probably the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably got the train rolling in that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> side of attitude it it kind of amazes me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this before this came along before trash </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chase came along </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um you look back to some of the views </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> popularity of potaku and it still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically holds up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> almost to a lot of the bigger podcasts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> came after it i mean there's only a few </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> podcasts that i can think of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that came after potaku that animated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime related that were able to you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do better in it with it in terms of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> views and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> views and stuff and potaka is like six </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> years old now so that that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of that kind of blows my mind you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to hear a glass from the past sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> warning the following audio may contain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> course language </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and other material that may not be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> suitable for a younger audience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> viewer discretion is advised that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> screaming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dude there's like maybe a couple of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hundred people watching this right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who just cream their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nostalgia that that intro is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> ingrained in my minds man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that your accent warning is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so you have been warned if you go to my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> channel the very very first video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is like a podcast that looks very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reminiscent of the editing style of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> another podcast oh really oh really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it looks very very similar with the the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cubes flashing up between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah yeah oh yeah um because yeah who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did you edit all of them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um no so originally it was basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between me and tristan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and holden who had to edit most of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> podcast and so we we basically edited </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the audio so they would sync up and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we would remove a lot of like when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have calls on skype </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people talking over each other yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people talking over each other and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really awkward pause where it's where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's you cut it all up smoothly yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly and then we were like we wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to make it a bit more visual </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so but we couldn't we we couldn't just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> film ourselves next to each other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so we kind of just decided to go with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> flashing boxes yeah it works really well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah and that was that was our way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of just evolving the podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and um i remember after poor taku we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of added </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a few more people as well right i want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to ask about that because i was when as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a viewer i was so confused there was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like towards the end would just start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> joining in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i was like jay taku and i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like what is what is going on with all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was jimmy on the podcast yeah jimmy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was so odd because it just seemed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like people were just recycling in and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was like wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is not what i want i wanted the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> boys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm on the big fallback you know like as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a viewer i was so confused i don't think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys like ever explain any of that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah so i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i'd be interested in knowing well for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was because the scheduling just got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> super hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like i said we weren't getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> paid for anything so this was this was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> making time making making time and we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got to a point with potaku where we were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having a [ __ ] hard time keeping up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with this two-week schedule </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i i wanted to and it had been a while </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> since potako started so i wanted to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spice things up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and i wanted to see if there was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we could get some chemistry with other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's when i brought on the idea of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jaitaku </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and adding more people and making making </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a distinct brand of potaku is where we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just talk about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pure whatever we want to talk about it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like a free-flowing podcast and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jaitaku </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is we're going to pick a specific topic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we're going to stay on top right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was that was the kind of idea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of jaetaku it was it kind of hit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything because it added some new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> elements to the podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it also made it so less of a load </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was on the original four as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but yeah it's it's interesting to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hear what you guys thought about it as a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> viewer perspective i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i didn't watch every single one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think i just saw like three j takus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i was so confused </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then i watch it i'm like who are half of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> these people yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's so strange and i think i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what um it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it really worked at first because jay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> jay taku did his job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it got to the point when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> jaetaku kind of even maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> became the flagship series because if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you look on if you look on the potaku </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> channel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of the most viewed videos ended up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being jaitaku </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> originally videos like our most viewed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was one where we literally just talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about hentai nice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of course know but that that was that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was back when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talking about him hentais are like very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hush-hush </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nobody likes nobody publicly liked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> hentai on twitter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or any any [ __ ] like that allowed me to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> introduce myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hi but um yeah so jaitaku kind of became </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the flagship series um because it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just got more views and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the main like the main the original four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people it just became harder and harder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for us to schedule </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um schedule schedule with the original </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> pataku </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah podcast um and i think that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's kind of what brought like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> helped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bring portugal to an end because i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like that era of anitube is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> defined by the start of potaku and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> end of pataku because i think the other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the end of potaku really it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coincidentally coincided with a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the times when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know joey really rose and people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realized they could do anime content for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> money as well yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which just wasn't an idea before then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember i mean should i talk about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the end of photography </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> go ahead if you want man we could edit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it are we about to do this now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> am i gonna am i really gonna bring this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up but it's up to you bro </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay so i guess i've never i've never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talked about this but we've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> we've obviously gotten a lot of comments </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about potako on this podcast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on this podcast and uh it was we i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think anyone's really publicly talked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and to preface this still love still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> love everyone on the podcast i'm not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about to talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mad [ __ ] or anything like that and the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> long in the story the long and the short </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that we came into some creative </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> differences </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about which way the podcast could go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to me potaku was the defining podcast of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the anitu community as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as i have just said and i really wanted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to push that further i want i wanted to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i wanted it to i wanted portugal to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> evolve more yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i saw the potential in how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> big the podcast could be because um the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> problem was that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we had trouble keeping up with our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> schedule and then we took like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> seven month break or something like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was very long i think it was it was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> very long </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> long day yeah yeah yeah and the reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically the podcast didn't really have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a like a designated leader right leading </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in right now so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've been like at the beginning of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> podcast it was mainly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me and tristan who were getting things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like getting getting things done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> chasing up yeah i mean jean loved gene </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she was she was like the mother of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> group but she was like she would like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> come in and out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because she was very busy with her real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> life holden [ __ ] talented as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] talented guy but it was you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i know i've told this told him before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unless you unless you tell if you tell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> holden to do something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he'll [ __ ] do it if you don't he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> won't do it if you don't he's not the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> type of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> he wasn't the type of person that would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like push people to do it you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know i think he's changed now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the better and i think potaka was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely a big learning experience for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> him as well so i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's definitely grown as a person but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back then it was mainly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was mainly me and tristan who was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pushing stuff to get done on the podcast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tristan started to get less and less </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> involved because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he started to transition doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime reviews as a hobby to actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> finally getting paid for it because he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had opened his patreon he was the only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> one that was actively doing vid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> videos companies that was at the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when tristan was like really at his peak </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah he was like really growing at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that time exactly i remember his patreon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was a big deal yeah yeah yeah exactly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he was the only one who was who had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> other commitments for his own youtube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> channel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so he just had less time than all of us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for me that was also the time when i got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my job at the bbc </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right right so you saw you see all these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> factors coming into play where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the driving force of the podcasts just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> less time to really make episodes and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people in jaitarki we were all good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they were you know they weren't the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> original four they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were they weren't the og4 they didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> really have the i'd say authority to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really take over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah you can't really step in and be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like this is mine yeah yeah yeah exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so we basically took a seven seven month </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> hiatus or it's it's it's a hiatus but it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was more of not nothing was getting done </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i i won't said anything nothing was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really happening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they left you on red </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was basically because we just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't have the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and what what was the driving force for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it to be revamped was i that was the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> point when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wanted to return to youtube i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting bored of my job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i was like okay first step i want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> put all my hard work into potaku and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really revamping this because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tristan's doing really well with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever he's doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with this patreon and i saw potential </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for not only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me coming back but also pushing poor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taku into something even bigger and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> better than what it was yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with help formerly you know trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> monetize it and they just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically making it have an incentive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for everyone to turn up every week </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly and so it ended up being i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> big driving force to getting potaki back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on his feet and that's why i got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> super super invested in it because i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one who was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting trying to get episodes done i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was editing a lot of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> not because i wanted to be paid or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything but i just wanted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this to you what you wanted your passion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be i wanted i wanted my passion to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> back on the ground yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and as as soon as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i felt it was kind of getting back off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the ground </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i remember tristan coming coming to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and he was like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i want it to end you know what i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um i looking back now i totally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why he did right because this this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where this is where i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i put it back to creative differences </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he saw that we weren't getting as many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> views as we used to before the hiatus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and also the dynamic of the group </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very different than when than when we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know some people weren't getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> along as well as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as as uh as they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were at the beginning so he wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> potaku to just end there you know yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he he wanted to be like okay instead of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just fizzling fizzling out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um i wanted to end here and i really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really tried to convince him to be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> look i know we're going through some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very big issues now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i see potential in this yeah there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was there was a lot of there was a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of factors </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i saw that could potentially have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> driven </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of hype back into botaku um before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> we ended that we had um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> jean had just left yeah right but she </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was she was going to come back we had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> scheduled that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we had also scheduled mintaku too which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the hentai episode which was like our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> popular one right so i was like look </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's we can do it we can do the combo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> plea i like i i i really really tried to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> convince him that it was too early to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> end yeah because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i totally agree with all the problems </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that the podcast had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if in order to survive and to go further </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we would have had to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make a lot of big changes and they could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have very easily blown up in our face i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> guess it's one of those things where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you could try but you could very easily </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fail so it's one of those things where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like do i want to put in this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> work and i can get the guaranteed pages </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah why really yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right like i kind of get it but at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same time i i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as a viewer i knew how like big it could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have been as well yeah looking in my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> position now and i understand how it all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> works like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it could have been i think it could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have been certainly yeah definitely it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would have needed a lot of work and it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would have take we would have taken a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> big risk and we could have failed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> massively but for me as a person i would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> rather </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> give that a go right right right one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah then wonder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it got to the point when it was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just like it was just this one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> clash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right of just i wanted i i thought it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was too early to end it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and tristan wanted to wanted to end it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and it was it was unfortunate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that you know you know i i i say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unfortunately i didn't i didn't get my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he didn't listen to me i tried i tried </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so hard there was a video that you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> all made when it ended right and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> remember watching this and it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of those moments you're like please </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> say psych </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> please say sorry jk lol but i remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> watching that video and it like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because i remember the order was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you first and it was like tristan was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> last </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and i i tristan i love tristan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> by the way just saying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i remember watching and i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thinking like man it kind of seems like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone was like really wanting to keep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing this but then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> tristan didn't almost as a viewer it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't like that it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the end as a viewer i think that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the impression yeah like it could be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> totally wrong just an impression i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was definitely a faction that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> supported </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> my stance right there was the faction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that supported tristan's stance i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> look like as someone who creates now i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can understand both yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't care about either i mean it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely a tough decision right now oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah anybody in that position would have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> been like ah [ __ ] do i take the risk or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> not at the end of the day if his heart's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> not in it his heart's not in it right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're going to like drag someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> along he doesn't want to do it yeah you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so was there no option to just do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> without tristan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean we we we wanted to respect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> tristan's wishes because we there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was the conversation of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> um should we do this without tristan you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just it just felt wrong yeah just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> understandable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i i wanted to leave the option i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> asked tristan would it be okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if we continued and then you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at any point if forever for whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever reason you want to return the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doors are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always open yeah and tristan was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> elements no i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and i understand because this was his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> baby </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no i don't feel comfortable letting my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> baby go and just seeing what happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so that's that's that's kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was kind of like the the last draw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was no there was no going back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from that and yeah that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically how it ended and it was after </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that um i i kind of lost a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> motivation because i put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so much of myself into getting this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> revamped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it just felt like it was just all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taken away and it was out of my control </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it i learned a lot from potaku with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like learning working on group projects </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i should probably and i want to say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not throwing shade at tristan at all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we still get along great </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah we all get electricity yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i i love tristan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just it was just a point where we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just had creative differences </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it happens i feel that's a very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> normal thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> people i've what i'm trying to say is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've really got to demonize and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah i'm i'm not demonizing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> tristan i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like we just had a different way of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> approaching things i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i still think back to portugal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and i still think hey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think it ended too early and he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously thinks the other way and he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought the other way back then and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> basically what it was how it is man yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just how it is yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously we don't want anyone going and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> being like what the [ __ ] man why don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you why don't you not believe in it man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like like i said earlier like if your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> heart's on it your heart's not in it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah it's not gonna happen i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can anyone like really blame tristan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like again it's it's a [ __ ] like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really if it's liberating as well right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if i didn't believe in it i'm normally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone who's like adamant about [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right so i would be like no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> no yeah i don't believe in this yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like i would be like that yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly so it's you know it's just how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it is right yeah yeah yeah and i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean i always look back to think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what could what could it be what could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be but that was that was just the end of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an era </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and now we're in a new era and i'm you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know everyone's gone down the different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> paths i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm really amazed to see what people are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting onto nowadays and it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] great and i'm still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i still speak to all the cast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> members every now and again especially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when we get to meet at conventions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hey bottom line is that at least there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't a single member of paul tucker </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that went and killed their family </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well that's a taker </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they didn't they didn't go down to mr </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> anime around all right let's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the silver lining </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 80s outro where it tells you what we've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> all been up to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] snapshot it's like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> joey didn't kill his family jesus christ </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my god that's a [ __ ] tape oh my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay okay before we end it right like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the way i see it right is if you were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still doing you know potaku trash taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably wouldn't exist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's that's true that's what i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saying i'm not trying to say you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that it's it's you know i'm i'm glad </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> so about connor oh no </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> you kill your family jerry in the wake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we should have seen the signs all along </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was in the name </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my god it it kind of felt that when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> potaku ended that it kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like tearing down the berlin wall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah just letting everyone [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> loose right because i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when a big pillar and a community kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of you know kind of falls right it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just a ton of people come free for all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right basically yeah like it's kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like everyone's looking for the new like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all right who's the person i'm gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> listen to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like we don't really have that at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the moment i don't feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything we have a few big people but i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feel that that's when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely you said the new era just was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like all right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hi because back then it was all about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing anime reviews </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it i i would say the content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> started to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really like it kind of like opened the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doors to all different kind of content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you're doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more vloggy videos and analytical </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> channels start to come along </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i i feel you know it was it was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coincidence that it happened during the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> end of partaku but i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for our community that was that was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> big turning point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh definitely yeah absolutely because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> remember that was when demos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> demo came along as well i think so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nearly enough back then when you were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> saying and he [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> changed the game as well oh no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely like there is i don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a single lander tube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's on the platform right now and no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> longer on the platform who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't look up the demo yeah in any if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you do stuff yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if you did anime stuff like demo was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just a name that came back right he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like the dad that went to go buy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cigarettes and just never came back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm glad i i came into it when i did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right i feel like i came into it at the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's perfect because it was where i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wanted to make the content i wanted to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> make right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think you came at a perfect time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it was around the time when the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whole anime youtube thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> really diversified itself in terms of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> its content so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people like you who did very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> unconventional anime content it was very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> easy to like just slip in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's great i mean i'm glad that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's gotten to the point where we can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know make a set like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right because like in my mind i didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> want to do a podcast unless it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this good yeah right like i just i've no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> interest in it like i don't want to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> audio yeah this everyone has an audio </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> podcast yeah like this this is what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of wanted to push potaku to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> direction of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going like me like we obviously didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> live in the same place but my idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was hey what if what what if we all flew </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to a place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> recorded recorded a ton of episodes yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and released it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on a schedule yeah and we could do that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on a periodic basis based on like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever funding we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we could have gotten yeah um but i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> glad that </SPEAKER_03>
