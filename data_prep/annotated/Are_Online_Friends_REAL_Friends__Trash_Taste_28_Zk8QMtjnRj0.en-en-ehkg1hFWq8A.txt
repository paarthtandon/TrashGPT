<SPEAKER_01> - Cinema rules, turn your phone off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or put it on silent mode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That includes you viewers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Viewers type too loud as well Meilyne </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause like last week, I
didn't want to say anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was like, fucking all
I could hear was you typing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when (laughter drowns out speaker) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sounds like you're playing
guitar here by the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (soft music) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Welcome to this episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a little darker than usual </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause one of our lights
decided to yeet out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as we used it earlier- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just randomly, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just started strobing and
it was not a pleasant feeling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's a little darker than normal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's audio only- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I believe none of us
have photosensitive epilepsy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause that was like dangerous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was strobing, like crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it was full on strobing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we're very lucky that none
of us is suffering from that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But anyway boys, how are you doing today? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm doing all right.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm feeling very energized right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why is that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, just I'm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had Mexican. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, I didn't have Mexican food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had Thai food and my stomach was dying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I thought I was going to die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I went to the toilet
and now I feel like a 10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You took like two- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thai food does do that to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You took two shits
in the span of an hour. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's pretty, it's pretty remarkable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not proud of it Joey, I'm not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It happens man, don't worry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You know that like Curry
place near our house, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like literally every time
I come home, after that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, I immediately
have to take a shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I'll wake up in
the middle of the night </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and have to take another shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's unfortunate being like a white guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who loves spicy food because
my body does not agree with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I love the taste of it
and I suffer the next day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like being whites,
being Southeast, Asian, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> being anything your body just
doesn't love spicy food like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh really, you get that as well? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I can handle spicy food, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but my stomach doesn't like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like every time, like every time I fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like chow down on a
massive fat Indian, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a ticking time bomb, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why'd you describe it like a fat Indian. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But I know exactly what you mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a fucking- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's a massive thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You never just have like a smaller- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - True thing, I've never had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never ordered Indian food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and been like, man, that
was just too little. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's going to be a fat
cor, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's a fucking ticking time bomb. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I know 'cause there's a
local Indian place I order from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then they do it like proper spicy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And depending on what time
of the day I eat it in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like there's a timer where
I have to wait six hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like going to be like, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this hour, I'm going to be just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> incapacitated on the toilet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's just the way it's going to be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like sometimes when I have
it for dinner, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh no, I'm going to wake up
at like 3:00 AM sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because my stomach just needs to go now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh man, I always... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, go, go on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was just going to say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I hope you're enjoying this podcast guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Where the first 10 minutes of
talking about violent shits. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just thought it's
very relatable content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Hashtag relatable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hashtag painful shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hashtag relatable took a painful shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Question, do you think it's weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we like listen to ourselves often? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, 'cause we have to
hear our voice all the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you think that's weird? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it was weird
when we first started off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because, people at home, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have you ever listened to
your, like your voice recorded? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You probably hate it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm assuming, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never grown out of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you still hate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you're still... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If anyone should be grown
out of it, it's you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate looking at my own,
like hearing my own voice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looking at my own content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like whenever I do a
collaboration with someone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I watch like the bare minimum
just to get what's going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I watch every moment of
that collab that I'm not in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, oh, I'm in it, skip, skip, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> then oh, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're like in the comments timestamps, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> please tell of when I'm not on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So why though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like why can you like, I mean, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe it's the better question to ask, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why can we stand on our own voice? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that's pretty the weirdest side. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Probably because we
just got used to, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean like-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think anyone grew up, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, ever went into that situation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure every family had it where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> your parents would just
be like, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's nothing really to watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, I found some home videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We can watch those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're like, no, thank you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I always fucking hated when my parents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> would play home videos in front of me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah same.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause it was always
me being a fucking idiot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's also like the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I used to have like a
fucking squeaker voice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was like five years old. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I legitimately used to sound like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hi guys." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I legit used to have that voice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And my dad would always
fucking rag me on me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, man, your balls really
dropped all of a sudden, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I fucking hated that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because when you're a kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not aware that you have that voice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause everyone has the
same voice around you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly! Exactly! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you grow with your voice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you don't suddenly be
like, Oh my voice got deeper. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Unless it's like a
really rapid growth like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had that.
- You had that, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you're just like your
balls just fucking dropped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought when it happened, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought it was going to go back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought I was like, I thought
I was sick or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And everyone at school
didn't believe me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But that's because your balls dropped </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a fucking cannon more, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like mine kind of dropped- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, mine kind of dropped like you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like putting like a rock in water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just a very slow drop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a very slow Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, because you grow with it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> especially if it's a natural drop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you don't realize
that, Oh, I went from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking Alvin and the
Chipmunks to the fucking- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We really talking about
this beat a bull drops now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you don't watch the podcasts at all? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> After we... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't want to Trash Taste? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I watch like some highlights, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I feel like with me
I'm just super self critical </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I've always been this way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whether it be with my work or myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's why like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd say like I've seen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anytime I see like criticisms
of my videos of my work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just, I'm more fine with it because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there hasn't been something
that's been said about me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I haven't already said about myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in some way, shape or form. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] I feel that.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So unless I'm like super
proud of a video, I really, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I find it difficult to watch it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because I see all the things that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I kind of could improve on it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or that I fucking hate about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just out there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you're too much of a
perfectionist basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> From what I'm getting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate the word perfectionist- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you are a perfectionist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I prefer the term self critical. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - A self critical perfectionist
is what you're essentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like you have an editor, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but you also edit your
own stuff too, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like every-
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You always do like
the finishing touches. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I always do the finishing touches. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So wait, so- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like when there's a
collab where I have zero control </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> over it, that's just like,
I wake up in a cold sweat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like,
(Joey and Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, what if I just look
like an asshole in this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So wait, so then how
do you get through your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> editing process? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because you have to
listen to yourself, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Over and over and over again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So are you just like cringing internally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> as you're like, oh, I need
to edit this part out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ' Cause you you're doing like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you got jokes, you had punchlines. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you not like think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> darn! That was a good delivery. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I nailed that delivery. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes I listen to a joke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I edit it for like three hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna just like, the
joke's not funny anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh)
And I just cut it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, it's a weird thing where
depending on how my mood is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my video could just be
completely different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I could just be watching myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, I hate this part. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to just rerecord
this entire segment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though it's going to add like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two, three hours to my
fucking video making process </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - See, that's why I'm glad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'd got an editor that has complete, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I gave complete creative freedom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So 'cause I'm pretty sure you were talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about this earlier, but
like at least with my editor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he leaves in shit that I
would have otherwise cut out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I, like, I tell
anyone I had edit for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, I don't care
how bad it makes me look. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Just make it funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Like please make it funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because, at least, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're going to get the draft, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're going to check it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and if it's really fucking bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you can just tell them to cut it out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But a lot of the times it's like, Oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my head, I thought this was not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to make it into the video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but he kind of twisted it
in a way where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's kind of a funny
bit, I never thought about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like where I like
fail a joke and I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> let me do that again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And he leave that in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That's just a joke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like the fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I guess it's like
the difference between like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> heavily scripted content and
more like improvised content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Because there are times when I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have like a fucking banger of a joke </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I watch it like
30 times as I'm editing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I have to like question </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whether it was funny in the first place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or whether I've just seen
it so many fucking times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's just lost all like
comic, comedic effect to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the reason I asked
that question earlier was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I saw a video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if it was a Ted talk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It sounds like a Ted talk topic, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It was something like, people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyday people should just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> record their voice and listen to it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so they can improve
their speaking in general </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be more confident. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right, right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because their theory was that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your overall general quality of life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and like doing anything in
daily life, improved drastically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if your speaking is more confident. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like if your voice is more confident. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I agree with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I would agree with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I think in general, definitely like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if there's been the one
big thing in my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that has done me solids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the voice and talking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - For sure, for sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just going at it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know and I maybe think a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, huh? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I guess I've never
really thought about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean obviously yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people say, Oh, you have
a nice voice and shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not to stroke my fucking dick but, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's the compliment
I get the most, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I thought- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I put VA in my name for a reason, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You do have VA in your name, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I mean, it's the
reason I became a voice actor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because people were telling me like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Hey, you have a nice voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I thought ah, maybe (murmurs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck you know your what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You're right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, damn! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do kinda, I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Because when I first recorded myself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought it sound like shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone's thinks like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then it's one of those
things where I think that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's definitely helped me a bunch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because not only have I improved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> my annunciation and just
general patterns of my speech </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just made my whole life
more confident by doing that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because you have
general self-confidence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because if I'm
hearing it, I'm like, damn! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I sound good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, is that considered as fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it's just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you just do get a skill set
by practicing it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you get happy with the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ability that you have to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> change it and make it sound
the way you want, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, I feel like even just being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on Trash Taste and just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, I don't watch
every episode that I'm in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but like I still have to
watch like certain clips </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just to check in everything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like, especially
my speaking skills </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has gotten a lot better, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> gotten a lot better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Of course I fuck up as
soon as I said that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Goddammit!
- A solid point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You really drove that point
over Garnt, thank you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, I agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I used to fucking hate public speaking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like in school it was-
- Oh, me too, me too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The worst thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And which was weird because, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I used to be part of my
school's debating team. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like we had like a debating team and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like groups of
three and you usually go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> against all the schools or
whatever the fuck it was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We do not have this in
the UK, I don't think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Unless you're in Oxford,
Cambridge I don't think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We definitely didn't have
this where I grew up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, yeah I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was literally just
the three of us that day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I was, I decided to join that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I realized how much I
fucking hated public speaking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and how bad I was just
speaking in general. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How old are you, when
you decided to do this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This was in, actually this no, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this was an elementary school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So this was like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Goddamn! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fifth or sixth grade.
- Wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like 11, 12 year old
Joey, was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I have a deficiency I
would like to improve. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going to do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what, like watching all those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like squeaker family videos,
man, I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to prove my voice man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to sound like Alvin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So basically, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I joined this debating team </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and of course like I was
in it for like two years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was still nervous as shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I was very fiddly and kind of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I had this really bad habit
of swaying, as I talked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like you don't realize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how many subconscious things
you do until you get filmed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is why you should record yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No and that's what we did, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So my parents sometimes would come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to these debating things
with other schools </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and of course they would record
it just for memory's sake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And of course, I'd be forced to watch it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> during our family fucking,
family video session. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Put it on the 4K monitor will you Joey? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I'll watch back on
and be like, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I looked like fucking
schizophrenic patients. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just fucking fiddling like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (stutters) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so my conclusion is... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but you were 12 dude, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would have shit my
pants to that situation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, but here's the thing all the other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> schools we went up against, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were just fucking shut as shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yes, your honor let me defend myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and my colleagues right here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like,
- [Connor] yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And meanwhile, I'm just
like, you have a point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was that level. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then, so, I tried to use that skill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I first started doing YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But of course, like
everyone's first YouTube videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It fucking sucks.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you know, I had that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I still have this problem to this day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where I say like, and
you know, way too much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And people on Trash Taste
have a point of that being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Take a shot every time
Joey says like, or, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you'll be dead in
the first five minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have like a lot of
like everyone subconsciously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has a lot of filler words
that you don't normally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hear yourself saying,
because it's filler words. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you say it, you kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fill in the gap yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there are times when I say like a lot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then there are times when
I just swear a lot as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's either like, you know, or fucking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's my three filler words. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But also, I'm assuming that, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm a viewer, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Who am I to be like,
accomplishes like too much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> As if they have like the
most immaculate speeches. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's right, that's right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, who are you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who are you to judge? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, do you go around, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not saying the word,
like ever in your speech </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like with any other people, like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess it's 'cause is it, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I understand that
everyone has shit that they do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they might want to change, but... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck there's something in my eye. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fucking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Why did you need to feel the need to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tell people I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wow, there's really something in my eye. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you alright?
- You good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Keep talking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What were we talking- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We were talking-
- Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So like, YouTube videos
fixing your speech puddles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because I feel
like when people see, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when people see doing
stuff on YouTube nowadays, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like the expectation is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for some reason the expectation is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they must know what they're doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're professionals.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's really weird because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember the first time I felt this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was when I started to get asked
to do like panels and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was thinking to myself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never been good at public speaking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my entire fucking life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And just because I have this audience, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this virtual audience of YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like conventions and stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expect you to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be in like a top tier panelists and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, this is
a skill I had to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> learn trial by fire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause my first few
panels were fucking shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I felt like shit because
I was shit at public speaking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But because you were forced to be put, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to put that, they force you
to be put in that situation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just had to learn it on the fly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I do find it funny that
just because we're on YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> people do have this
expectation of just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, they must be really confident </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and have this professional
kind fucking background and- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Otherwise how would they
get all these subs, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, you couldn't talk properly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they seem to forget that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we all started in same place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Making videos in our uni
bedroom or our parents' bedroom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> parents' basement or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Although to be fair in my case, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a little bit different
because I hated public speaking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but I was always okay in
front of large crowds, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You'd think it's kind
of counter-intuitive- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't that literally
public speaking? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, but, but. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No, but here's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it private speaking if it's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, that's the thing though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like when I was doing
the debating team stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the most we would ever talk in
front of was maybe 30 people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And there's some weird, it's
really counter-intuitive but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of the times I'm more nervous </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in front of a small crowd
than I am a large crowd. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's more intimate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like it's, if you have to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in front of people, you know, especially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's a little harder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I've done like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I used to do classical piano </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I played live at like
the Sydney opera house once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in front of like a thousand people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh shit, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Stop dropping that
like it's nothing like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I guess I did you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That came out of nowhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So basically I used to do
like music, like properly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I got the chance to perform
at the Sydney Opera House </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in front of like a thousand people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How old were you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 14, 15. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh wow.
- Fuck! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And yeah, it was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, you're playing at the Opera House. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, like the Opera House. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the Asian parents
dream right there, goddamn! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, oh true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My mom has never been more proud of me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's all- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's never coming off the fridge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That's for sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Extra rice for you tonight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did your mom fucking film
it and then like frame it- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course she did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then frame it then they put in like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the safe and stuff and just like, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, of course she did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Of course she did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think one thing that
really helped me realize that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> start not giving a fuck is that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and this is just a general
life as well is that like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't remember who told me this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were like, everyone
is always way more worried </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about themselves than
they ever are about you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so like, if you just
think about it like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and think about how you think about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when someone is public speaking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't fucking care if they're shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just, most of the time
I'm just sitting there anyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like they can just say anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'll probably be like, Oh cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, unless they like literally
shit their pants on stage, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not going to think
anything bad of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So if you go into that mindset of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, I'm going to talk
in front of these people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> None of them care really, fuck it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How can I fuck this up? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could be terrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but speech I feel
is a little bit different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because even if you do fuck up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can very quickly
try and fix it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a little bit different when you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> playing solo piano in front of a crowd. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, dude you play jazz, pure jazz. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just do it.
(all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not classical
anymore it was jazz now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When you go on stage, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> do you remember the stuff
you do and the stuff you say? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I don't remember that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, because- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you still get nerves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when you have like a big
panel or a big event that- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, I don't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I get nerves right
up until I'm on stage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Same here, same here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So like on the, like up the
stairs going onto the stage, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm fucking nerves and shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the anticipation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like, I just
want to get this over with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want to get on
stage and just do my shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, the reason why is because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know if you're doing a debate thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no one cares about who you are, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But when it's your panel, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> All the people come for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, I can sit there and
insult them for 20 minutes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they'll probably be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> damn! Connor is exactly
like he is on camera. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm kidding-
- Just as much of an asshole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's how you deal with
like hecklers, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you just give them shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone's like, Oh, that was funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you ever had hecklers at a panel? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, one time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really?
- Yeah, they were like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, what happened? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, Oh God, it was at a
fucking Hentai panel and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that's the problem.
- Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, RA team panels,
I've never done one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because everything I've heard about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a fucking horror story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God! I call if
I didn't mention this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in like the convention story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I do, I offer to like conventions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, Hey do you want me
to run a hentai dabbing panel? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And essentially what it is
is I just get a bunch of hentai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I blow out the subtitles
and I'm like wing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just make shit up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - People are fucking terrible at it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's, what's funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But eventually you'll get like one person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> who's actually like really fucking funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's what it's for. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I think one time I was doing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's this dude in the back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he must've been like 30
something, just on his own. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was just shouting cringe, cringe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cringe the whole time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "do you want to come up?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's like, "no." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "well
get the fuck out then." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And everyone was like, (claps) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs)
- Golf claps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then late claps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So everyone cheered.
- No joke, no joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No because at panels
there's always that one guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who thinks that like the panel
was a YouTube comment section </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they always try to like
be that fucking smart ass, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like throw out that smart ass comment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it never fucking,
it's never fucking funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know who you are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, I must be blessed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I've never had
that at a panel of mine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, normally those types of panel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the people, lot of people are good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you just bring
them up when you do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, if I ever
put into that situation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd do exactly the same thing, all right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - God, it was terrible.
- I'd tell them to fuck off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - One time there was this hentai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was brother and sister. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And a brother and
sister came up to dub it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was the most worst
thing I'd ever done in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jesus Christ.
- Oh God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was terrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's cursed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was so cursed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I regretted it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, you know, when you
do something you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this sounds hilarious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it starts, you're like, Oh no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh no, please stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Please stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is just like immediate regret. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They offered and I was like, Oh God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, this sounds funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never been tempted
to do an RA team panel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I've only seen like bad things
happen to RA team panels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I've only seen and
heard the worst things happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause here's the thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if you come to my panel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I'm usually open to any
kind of fucking question it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it seems like when
people see RA team in a panel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I've been to RA team panel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They ask shit that is not like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's bad in any kind of context. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's not a question
it's just dub hentai, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't fucking do anything weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and if you do- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, but what I'm talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like the RA team, like Q&A panels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, those are fucking
weird, I don't get those. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I don't know what it is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some people just think, Oh it's RA team, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> therefore I can ask them
the most like private shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That they otherwise
wouldn't say I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no, motherfucker. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not going to tell you private shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just 'cause it's RA team. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't care. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like motherfucker even my
therapist doesn't ask this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and here you are just asking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the most intimate fucking
details of my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never been on an RA team panel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I've seen some of
the question that has, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some of the questions that have
been asked on RA team panel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's horrible.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It depends on the
crowd, doesn't it really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes you get real like, Oh God! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and sometimes they're quite funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, that's the thing it can be funny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but there are just some people
who don't know what funny is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it's funny to them, but
then the moment it comes out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's like, yikes, you
shouldn't have said that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, that's like
discord humor, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like funny between
you and your friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but not funny to everyone
else in the room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Most of the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So sometimes it's like
online humor just doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> translate into real life situations, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially with a lot of discord humor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you can tell when
someone's been on discord </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a little too much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When they ask questions
like that, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hmm, okay you need some real interaction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Man! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I saw this tweet and it
made me think about discord. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know, I keep searching topics here but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there is someone who was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't be well adjusted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if all your friends are only on discord. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> What do you think about that statement? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is a take. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I thought about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and when I read that, I'm
like that seems way too harsh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But the more I thought about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the more people I know who are
kind of like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And when I was the same,
when I had friends online </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think I was very well adjusted, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when I only had friends online. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, do you know what
I've imagined right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know the picture of that
stick guy who's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was my exact reaction. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause it sounds too much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like that's a bit of a generalization </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but at the same time, I'm thinking, huh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of the people I know who
only have friends on discord. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> As in like only have friends on discord </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who I've probably like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> especially people who have not seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the anime conventions and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like always people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> are a bit weird in terms of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how they are socially adjusted
and everything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This episode is sponsored by Honey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Imagine this, you make a list of gifts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're going to buy for
holidays and then someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> randomly gives you the
money to help you buy one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sounds good, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well that is what Honey's doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No fucking way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is exactly what Honey is doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're helping pay for $1
million worth of gifts card. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even Santa could not do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A whole million. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They say no more
either, this is the money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The real gold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] You're probably
wondering is this the same Honey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that automatically searches
for promo codes online. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes it is, yes it is
Joey, of course it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why would you even say that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can confirm that it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the script says so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - With Honey, you can also make a list </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of all the holiday gifts
you want from certain stores </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Honey will email
you when the price drops </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on anything on your list. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just add Honey to your computer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> create a free account and
throw some holiday gifts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from your drop list for a chance to win. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To win, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I'm glad you asked Garnt, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because Honey will select winners </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and give them money to help
buy something on that list. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You gonna win the money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are we winning son? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are we actually winning son? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are winning son. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> If you use Honey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey, what are you going to add </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to your drop list this Christmas? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want a PS5. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Understandable, have a nice day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No purchase necessary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You need a PayPal account

<SPEAKER_01> - It's only valid in the US

<SPEAKER_01> That is joinhoney.com/trashtaste </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> Fuck Santa, go to Honey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Epic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like there is a difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> between online friends and
let's say real friends, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because you know, I
say this as someone who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has met most of my friends online </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and has found my fiance
online, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I will say that they
didn't feel like real friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like until I saw them in real life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like that's like sealing the deal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because there's something about
having online friends where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's always that wall of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how well do I really know this person? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you could, there has been
like plenty of times where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I've like connected with them immediately, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you guys being like some of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then there are equally as many times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I've meet them in real life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wow, you were not how I imagined you to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this is weird now
and I feel uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we've all been there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like if you
just have that first step </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where it is just the online relationship </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're missing out on a
big part of what it is to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> be friends and be social
and everything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I've always been
since like fucking age 12, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would happily get on fucking voice chat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and talk to like fucking 30 year old, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Why did I do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's a-
- Yeah, that's- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wouldn't know 11 and
12 year old who do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, what was the context of this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (all chuckle) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So he invited me to the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sounds like a beginning- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It sounds like the beginning
to a Chris Hansen episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, when you feel
like cold Zombies, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would gladly get on the mic and like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would like bully these 30 year old men. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like (indistinct) like I
didn't give a fuck dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I was 12, I would
gladly like shout at people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I would be- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nah, I didn't have that man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I like the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is your anger
fucking coming out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like the comments said dude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm a walking coin flip, someone said. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think you asked for Danny J yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, you asked for Danny, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you coming out of bottom again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I love that meme. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No joke, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My little brother was too scared </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to argue with people online. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So when he did start to
argue with people online </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was in the other room, I'll be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Owen, give me the fucking headset, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to argue, you play. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I would fucking shout at them for him </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because he couldn't do that good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he would lose the arguments. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, you're not losing
the arguments on my account. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Over my fucking dead body. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you think I would
allow you to lose that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, I would just 'cause </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's one of those things right where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would not fall for shit
when I was like 12 or 13. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The shit that they would try and pull. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> For some reason I knew what was happening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> most of the time when I was aware. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because even from like age- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What was happening? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was just fucking playing zombies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with them most of the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most of the chill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, it was all good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was weird back
then because it just started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when everyone started voice chatting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was new and it
wasn't really weird yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Now it's weird if you do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's super weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But back then, I didn't
think of it as that weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was a kid, but maybe try to- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - True, true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, back then it
was like this new thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and now we've so many fucking
weird stories coming up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You gotta be-
- Yeah, now it's not... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If I had a 12 year old kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I heard him talking to a 30 old man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd be like, what the fuck you doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, I get why people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have a lot of online friends it's because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most of the time people
search for online friends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they don't find that
connection in the people- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, totally no, I did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, I did, yeah I totally felt that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but it's the same
thing I would say is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you, you can have like
the best friend in the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but as soon as like you
move in with each other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and live in the same house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that like can change a lot of dynamics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Especially, you know, you meet somebody, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> especially in fucking uni, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you meet some people you think are chill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as soon as you move in with each other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you start hating each other. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah, it's true, it's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you see all their
little fucking ticks and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that just get on your nerves so... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, there was like a... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I've basically been raised </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like on the internet, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like ever since like age 11, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was playing Runescape, I was
doing show on Miniclip like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I always did not
mind talking to strangers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I always thought like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not going to give out
any personal information. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know I never did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> For some reason I was smart enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to never do anything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there must have been a good cha... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe like a year in my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where I pretty much only
spoke to online people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like friends that I felt
were like my friends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, it must've been maybe
first year of university. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really weird, I never had a concept </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of an online friend
until I started YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I never would get on to, like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like we were two
different sides of the coin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I was always like,
I would always go on- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause in my head I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why would I talk to this
random person online </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I have IRL friends to talk to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's the-
- That's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, there you go Joey,
here is where it gets sad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it didn't at the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And the thing is, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that you think, Oh, this is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 'cause I used to see
those things on Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause back then you
should see this things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like online friends are real friends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Mom, you don't get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Back when Tumblr was like peak Tumblr. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I used to totally agree with that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I was like, I was
16 and that's all I had. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then after I like actually
got real friends I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, this is what normal friendships are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it's like totally different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's something that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think you realize
kind of affects you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you totally think you're fine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think you can be well adjusted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sort of if you have only online friends, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's a lot harder. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I feel like having that IRL </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of interaction to
ground you and make sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're not doing weird things and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you're interacting
in a healthy way, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, 'cause the thing
about only having online friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that inevitably you are
just living in your own bubble. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It is an online bubble, right?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And you live through
what you present to them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're only presenting
one side of yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or the best side of yourself, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're not seeing every side of a person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So inevitably if you
just live in a bubble, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you might luck out and be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay this is actually a healthy, nice, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nicely balanced bubble. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But you know, most of the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're missing some kind
of that social interaction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Social connection that
you just don't get online </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I also think because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I made a lot of the
friends through gaming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of the time
how you were as friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was dependent on how you were in the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And obviously, I was definitely
really good at the games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was normally like,
yeah, I'm kind of cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was one of those
things where online </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I switch this
people, like I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to those friends I was
respected and they thought, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wow, this guy is so cool
he just does his own thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But in real life I was a fucking loser. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all chuckle) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it kind of made this
dichotomy in my head </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm like, yeah, I'm
funny, yeah, I'm charming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I'd go meet up with
people and I fucking struggle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I couldn't, I didn't know how to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I hadn't really, I
wasn't very well adjusted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it made me think a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it makes me look
back and I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, how do you convince someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they're in there to see it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, where in that sense of,
I only have online friends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How do you make them see that maybe that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not a healthy relationship. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's not very healthy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because to them they might
be perfectly happy and fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right and that's the thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's just a matter
of perspective, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because to them, that's all they know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I don't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until they actually
experienced the other side </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like trying to begin and
start and maintain IRL friends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They just won't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They'll be like, Oh, why would I do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> When this is so much easier
and more comfortable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And also I realized as well that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when I was predominantly
spending all my time online, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it felt like I could never
make any progress in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I was not investing
anything in real life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe I'd go to work and I'd go home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but that was about it, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I never made any investment elsewhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I felt like my life
stagnated because of that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I didn't... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think when you make friends IRL- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause you didn't
seek out something else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because when you make friends IRL </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not just that it's like you miss out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on a lot of opportunities in general. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, because you're not
putting yourself out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe other jobs you might hear about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You miss out on a lot of things I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's not just as simple </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as having friends and
having friends it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a lot of stuff that
comes with having IRL friends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's really made me think a lot recently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> especially 'cause like
moving to Japan as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's really made me think a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause it's been a year, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Since you guys moved. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's been a goddamn
year since we moved here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Already. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is not felt like a year at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Jesus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 2020 has been fucking
weird though to be fair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But how was it for you guys,
your first year here in Japan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's been, I mean, to
be fair, it's probably, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty abnormal year for people
who moved around this time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause of the rona but- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's been a strange year all around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't feel like I've spent
a proper year here in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mostly because like I
felt like part of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> experience I was expecting from Japan was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to have people visit me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I had a lot of friends who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had planned to come visit us in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and it just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly that's half the
fun of living in this country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right, it's like being like, Oh man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've always wanted to visit Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or like I'm coming to visit Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> My boy, I got you bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanted to be on
the other side of that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the other side of that fence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I've been on the visiting side </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I remember how amazing shit
was when I first moved here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything was so bright
eyed and you could take me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to a fucking family Mart
or a Konbini and be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yo, yo, you eat this like
katsu Curry every day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with this fried chicken, yo- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you got sandwiches, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just watching those interactions
is like so fucking fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because to you now it's just so normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but to them, it's just so fucking alien. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, I remembered like
I was at the supermarket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I would just thought to myself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man, I remember when I used to think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this shit was like insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like, now I feel like
there's nowhere else left </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> on earth where I'm ever going to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's going to feel magical. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it felt kind of sad
for a second because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Japan is the final boss of countries. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I had been
hyping up Japan my whole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like teenage to adult life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was the one place that
I always really wanted to go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I went to America and it was amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right.
- Yeah, I loved it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'd always hyped
of America to myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then Japan was the last
place that I hadn't been to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was like, I really want to go here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause my parents took
me to Europe all the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was kind of sick of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's sounds so fucking- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Privileged.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was sick and tired
of traveling Europe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, my parents took me to
like France every single year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, dying to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds like a luxury dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We were camping in like tents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just liked playing video games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I couldn't play video
games for three weeks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was basically being
like forced to be a caveman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for three weeks and like swim. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, Ugh! Okay, I
swim every day, I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I mean, it was basically
the last place I wanted to go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember the first
time I landed here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though I hadn't
slept for like 20 hours, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was so fucking hyped. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was just, this is fucking insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I can get vending machine, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's vending machines and they work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought I would like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember when I came
in for the first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought if I ever move here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to get vending
machine coffee every fucking day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause this shit is awesome. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now I can't fucking
stand vending machine coffee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Literally every- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Get that shit outta here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just give you my Starbucks
like I do everywhere else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you first come here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> every vending machine you like,
I guess I'm getting coffee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's hot coffee, baby. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah, now you have it and
you're like this is the worst. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you remember when
we first moving here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you get like (indistinct)
which is all you can drink. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like was like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fucking- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Colds life to earth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like a God sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like whenever we'd go here and
we'd go to like the Zacchaeus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we thought we'd be
going to like Keno Kuda </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every fucking day. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's there gnome hoda? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Not even a question, of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Keno Kuda is essentially
worth the sprint. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think we said that
before, but it's very cheap, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> very cheap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like 15 bucks all you
can drink for two hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's nuts.
- [Joey] Yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but then you realize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, shit I actually like
my liver a little bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I don't want to fucking ruin it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I also liked good food as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And there's no got bad food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you just get better- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's very average food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just get better food elsewhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I remember like coming
to Japan, like everything... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In my eyes all food in Japan was amazing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I lived here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and now I've realized that it's all good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there are different
tiers of how good it can be- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm going to wonder
what it's like when I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever I go back to England or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where good food is just
so much harder to find </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than it is here, where it's
just readily available. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I'm getting pot
noodle the moment I get back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Bombay bad boy pot noddle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You should just like do the opposite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You should just fucking commit
and just go to a Wetherspoons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and just be like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love Wetherspoons food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well then there you go but- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's got shit taste.
- Let's how it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's see how it is after you- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fuck with Wetherspoon's food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What I don't understand is
Connor's fucking obsession </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with the Tesco- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Meal deals. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tesco meal deals.
- What's that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You had one.
- You had one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I forced you to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So Tesco meal deals, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a thing in the UK for three pounds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is about maybe just under $4, $4. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You get a nice sandwich,
a big bag of crisps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like one of the premium drinks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can get like a smoothie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can get like an energy drink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did I have that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I took you because
you've got the big sandwich </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's quite big and
get a big bag of a crisp. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You fucking loved it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember you were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yo, is all this for three pounds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, yeah, it's insane, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I'm vaguely remembering. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I really like the
sandwiches they make. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember I had the
Wetherspoons that I had on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in some kind of train
station and I was like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was pretty bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I took Joey to the Wetherspoons
of Victoria station </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was terrible.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I don't think
Wetherspoons is terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I like what's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It depends on the pub though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it does, it does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But for the most part
Wetherspoons is like pretty, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty decent for the price you get. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The one there though was, we were, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think we were struggling
to find a clean table. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like longer than actually
deciding what to eat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it was gross. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I remember when
Joey was coming to visit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> me and Connor were like discussing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, what should we do here? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What should we show him? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Connor was like Tesco meal deal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Tesco meal deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm getting him a Tesco meal deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like Connor, for fuck's
sake nobody gives a shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about your three pound
Tesco meal deal, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, I don't care if
I become a billionaire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you bet I'm going to be eating McDonald's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and fucking Tesco meal deals
until the day I fucking die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That shit is value and
I won't hear otherwise. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it tastes amazing, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It tastes good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I genuinely don't remember eating it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I feel like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm hurt Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm hurt, I really I'm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, after living in
like, after living in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like living in Asia where
convenient stores just have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my opinion, just good
food to choose from- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the sandwiches in
Tesco are better than Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, sandwiches have like mayonnaise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and like Ketchup and all that shit in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't need that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, you're out of the question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where does all the crust go in Japan? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where's all the crust gone? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, probably just thrown out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - For some reasonable sandwiches
don't have crusts on them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Where is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Give me my fucking crust. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I love the crust in sandwiches. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think though sometimes the sandwich- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I actually that's the reason
I like Japanese sandwiches. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, in some- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're like a 12 year kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you can't have Mayo, you
can't eat the fucking crust </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on your, this man doesn't like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's still bread. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah man, what's the problem? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It tastes good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just wasted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Wasted bread that's like tasteless- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wasted bread, it's the good- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It tastes like bread. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yo, it's the flavor, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the best part of the bread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's so good, it's
tastes like cardboard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, it doesn't.
- What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It tastes exactly like the
bread that's attached to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the crust on pizza, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Why does crust on pizza exist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and why does everyone pretend that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It tastes good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it doesn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You eat the pizza for
the fucking bread, cheese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and tomato sauce combination. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're literally a 12 year old kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would I want to eat pizza, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that is why would I just want to eat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the bread part of the pizza
where I wanna have pizza, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want the pizza part of the pizza. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's because your eating it wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're going right
up to the crust mainly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you gotta save a little bit
of the sauce and cheese- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly then they go on the side. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> People think I'm a fucking
psychopath when I eat pizza, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the way I actually eat pizza
at home which is crust first. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I eat the crust first because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get the taste of shit out of the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm only left- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then how do you hold the pizza? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just hold it like a, like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck are you doing bro? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You're holding it like L
dude, like is it fucking- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Look, look, look. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just save the best part till last. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why would I save the
tasteless part till last? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't enjoy eating the crust. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're making it tasteless
by only eating the crust. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you need to combo it, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If you save a little bit of the sauce </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that sauce could be with the actual pizza. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the pizza has plenty of sauce. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like eating the fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like when you're
having a nice fucking meal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you eat your broccoli
and vegetables first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have like your chicken
or your steak afterwards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you save the best parts for last. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, do you always
everything's separate? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not always. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If it like synergizes perfectly, if it's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like you would know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you would fucking know Mr. Harmbody. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The crust synergizes with the pizza. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> The crust just takes the pizza taste out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I go fucking Italian
HAM on this bitch like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it synergizes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you get those shitty
frozen pizzas, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That are like $1 a pound, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They're the ones with no crust. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know those fucking
fake deep dish pizzas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that are just all bread
and like the finish- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like his fucking
dream it must be without crust. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My fucking dream is
like proper thin crust, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Italian pizzas, where like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the pizza goes right up to the crust </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's because it's
so thin it doesn't take, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't get in the way
of the actual pizza itself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It doesn't get into the way of the slice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You gotta grip on something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't give a shit
about greasy fucking hands </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if the pizza tastes better.
- I do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's just optimizing the pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There is so much wasted space on pizza, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's it's, like the
crust gets in the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the pizza taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, then okay, why
don't you do this then, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you get the pizza next time, right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's a thick crust, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just fold that bitch in half. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, because that's like, that means- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like you're making
a problem out of this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that doesn't need to be there.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just roll up the pizza so
that it's all in one thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just assume, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Whenever I see anyone who
leaves the crust on a sandwich </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or leaves the crust on a pizza I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> your parents clearly didn't
like beat it into you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to eat that shit dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- 'Cause my- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If I left crust on bread
my mom would beat my ass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She'd murder me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - She'd be like, why are you wasting food? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'll be like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got away with a lot of shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but leaving food was not one of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that's why if I have to eat pizza, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I eat it crust first. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like when- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's just there (wailing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You make it sound like
a fucking torture man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is torture for me because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're ruining this good fucking food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with just tasteless bread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was only one time
where it's acceptable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to leave the crust on a pizza </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that is a buffet of pizza </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like I got
to optimize this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want none of this shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it's always shit crust. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But if you just have dominoes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> then you have the crust. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And also and like crust
just takes extra room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just extra room in your stomach </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that can be filled with nice tasty pizza. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to get filled
up with like tasteless crust- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How small is your fucking stomach? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want that fucking pizza, okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How small is your stomach? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or I guess this tiny bit
of crust here is going to- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know I'm right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I am not the crazy one here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did we get on pizza. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've been quiet about this for too long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Crustless gang, where you at,
where you at crustless gang. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - All the ten-year-olds
raised their hands. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Point is, where is the crust Japan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't like it if they take it from me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because sometimes I think
the best part of the sandwich </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is like the give, the
crust adds to it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You gotta bite it a little bit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you gotta target a little bit.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes it just crumbles
apart without the crust, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like the integrity of
this sandwich has been ruined. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's been optimized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is not been optimized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You cut off all the useless pieces- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Although, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I will say sometimes 711 is
by far the guiltiest of this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you'll get a sandwich from 711, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they'll show you the sandwich, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it looks like fucking
packed in the front dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This thing is like
quadruple ham slices, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You open up the sandwich then
you get it out you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God, it's thick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then as you realize
you grabbing your hand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like, huh, it's pretty thin, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty thin at the end you
peel it up and there's no ham. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At the other half of the sandwich </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, I've been fucking played. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You got fucking clique
baited by sandwich. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you have to like,
weirdly like curl the bread up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so you can get like an even bite of bread. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fucking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 711, can you fucking sort that shit out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And everyone says that food is the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's honestly the
worst one out of the... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Ah no, Family Mart is, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, Family Mart is the worst. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I have to stand with Family Mart. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I'm a 711 simp man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're a Lawson simp, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I love Lawson. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We're just looking at the Konbini. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We'll save for the Konbini. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're going to leave
this for the Konbini </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct) okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We'll do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We need to just you ask a- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - There are three genders. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughter drowns out speaker) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's like the difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> between fucking Tesco's,
Sainsbury's and co-op, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, they- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know but I'll just
agree with you in that case. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What did they have in fucking Australia? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What, in terms of convenience stores? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Carbot, chipublic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, no one goes to a
convenience store in Australia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's all just supermarkets. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Spike bottlers, as they say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No that's a liquor store. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I know.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Expect that is your lunch. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't want to buy
food from a liquor store. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I will say probably the thing that I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very quickly got adjusted to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that I think that will hit me
like whiplash when I return </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is deliveries here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh, yeah.
- Because- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you speaking of optimized? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You get so used to it here
because what happens is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have we spoke about this
on a podcast before? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think we have, have we? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So when you get a delivery in like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess any other country, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like will arrive
between 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you just got to be home on a Tuesday, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hope you listen out, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you fucking miss it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For a single knock on the door. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they didn't knock on the door, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they say that they were
there and it's like bullshit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, you didn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it's this whole fucking pain, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you got to try and reschedule like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, we can come back in four days. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I pre-ordered this game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanted it today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But in Japan, when you miss a package, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not only can you reschedule on that day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> within a two hour time slot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So if you miss it between
like 8:00 and 12:00 AM </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is the only four hour time slot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can get it redelivered
between 12 and two, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> four and six, six and eight, nine to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like the same day delivery. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally the whole day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can pick the two hour, it's nuts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And on Amazon, when you do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can also pick the two hour time slot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's nuts.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so insane and it works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, there are also like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what is it, where the UK and
stuff, some places have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in London I have like Amazon
now or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we do have that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's insane to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I spoke about
that on the podcast before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when I ordered like Mario party and shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's when it arrives
literally a few hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> after you order it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why don't we have that, man? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if Japan gets into something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I would love that because- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would never leave my
house if there was that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just fucking get- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, it was made for groceries mainly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, right?
- It just happened to have, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like products.
- Which is weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was thinking back
to our podcast last week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the Lexion and I
remember thinking to myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> man, how would I have survived in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and got set up if Amazon didn't exist? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like he did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like when he first moved
here and I was just thinking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man, so much of my life has
revolved around Amazon in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that if I didn't have it, I would be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> life would be 10 times harder. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It does become, when
something is on Amazon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I've noticed it becomes
about 10 times more difficult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get the thing that I
want and delivered the- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause you have to walk it up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and being like, all right,
where's the closest store </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you have to find
out when the stores open </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you have to go in
and fucking look for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a mess.
- Moving, gross. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I also think I would
still feel kind of sad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I feel that because
everything is so easy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I got comments, a couple
of comments complaints </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about not knowing Japanese
and living in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not complaining, I'm
just fucking British </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just complaining about the things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that I complain about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know it's my fault for
not knowing Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, he's British.
- I'm not a fucking idiot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I know who that is
probably not a good idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to not speak Japanese till
you get your back, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But a lot of people do
come here to learn, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I do think that if I was forced to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say 10 years ago or 15 years ago, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that I would have been
forced to learn a lot more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I would have no choice, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right now, I don't need to do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Google maps tells you where to go, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Google maps tells me the restaurants. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I Google translate every webpage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's pretty much all sorted for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's catering more towards
foreigners definitely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It also doesn't help
that this is basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a society that has optimized like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not talking to people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Getting the least amount
of human interaction posture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You go to a restaurant
and you have a tablet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you order your stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So most of the time you don't
even need to talk to anyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is what, I like, I get, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you must get this a lot, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you get comments asking you like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how's your Japanese coming along? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How's your Japanese coming along? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah Garnt, how is it coming? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it Josie? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is, I've already
gotten Josie a few times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's difficult, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it's hard to explain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because essentially, I think
people have a misconception </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of how much we interact
with Japanese people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I talk to a Japanese person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm forced to speak Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most often at the Konbini or
at the Danny's or whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like at a restaurant or a store. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Those are the three most common times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's a script. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I know exactly what
they're going to say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They always say the same things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know exactly what you mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause we were getting coffee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I think it was last week or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> at the book walk offices and
Connor ordered the coffee </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it almost sounded like fucking fluent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with all the responses he was making. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was just, I think it was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know how it is where you've
ordered something enough times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you just know the
question that you get asked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I've perfectly
optimized ordering coffee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, when you watch
a movie and you see the line </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> before the actors say it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know what you're going to say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know where the, if
that script is like varied </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in the slightest, you
just go, you just go, like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I have no idea what the
fuck I'm doing anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because what happens is I'll
be ordering coffee, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And here's the order every single time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You go in there, you say what you want, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll ask you, do you
want it to stay or to go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So your gonna say to go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they'll ask
you, do you want a bag? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You say, no, you don't want a bag. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you just say how you want to pay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you can just say that, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's always how it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And every time it goes
wrong and if Joey's with me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll just slowly turn
to Joey and be like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's only two times
I've seen a slow head turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's in a horror movie
and when I'm with you guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's out of the script,
it's just very slow like, help. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I don't want to go, Joey help. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just wanna be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> dozo Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll leave it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's actually funny
when you're not there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause when it's, there have been times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when it's just me and Connor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and we're at like a
restaurant ordering something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then we get something off script </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's both of us trying to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cumminisively figure out
which one of us knows like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> as much Japanese as each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, we're trying to like combine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> our Japanese knowledge to be
like, okay, you know this word, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know that word so we can, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's try and figure out what were saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's combine these two words together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the thing though
like, that's like one... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I'm such a fucking sadist but like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the one thing I fucking love when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friends who can't speak
Japanese, I'm hanging out with- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But are assholes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we go to like a
restaurant or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or we go out somewhere or we
go traveling somewhere is that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because I don't look Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people don't expect me to know Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I love every now and
then going to a restaurant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like a bunch of non Japanese friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and pretending I can't
speak a word of Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and just letting them be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, (speaks in a foreign language) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there just like, fuck you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck you Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So yeah, outside of those situations, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we pretty much don't really
speak to Japanese people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Although to be fair you've been recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking interacting with like-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Japanese people on Apex, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, so I thought to myself, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm taking these Japanese
classes two times a week, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> problem is I'm not really
doing much outside of that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then people will be like,
Oh, why don't you study more? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, the work schedule
that we have is already </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty fucking hectic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And there's only so much studying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before you have to actually
use it in practice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think like, no matter
how much study I do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if I'm not using it.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like practically,
it's not going to help. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So yeah, I just decided, fuck it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, you know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to stream talking
to Japanese people on Apex. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just trying to make friends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna just to make some
friends pretty fucking fast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even though most people
do not want to talk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I was tuning
into one of your streams </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you were like interacting quite well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can speak super, super basic and- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But they were getting it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They can normally understand
what I'm trying to say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The best thing is is that
if I don't know something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like chat, chat, what is this word? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How do I say this thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they tell me,
and I don't forget it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because I'm using it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like immediately over and over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And so that's been a really helpful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And if you want to go and
watch those, you can watch them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the highlights, whatever (murmurs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, that's been super helpful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But outside of that, like
we don't fucking use it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like-
- I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can use, I can talk
to you guys in Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's, okay Joey,
it's different 'cause- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's different Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you know how bad we are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's embarrassing right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You have to throw that aside because like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm fine doing it in
front of 2000 people live. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But not in front of me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, not in front of you.
- Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not going to judge you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Joey's a smart motherfucker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We know, that's not the point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we judge ourselves when we're with you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like a subconscious
thing where I'm just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't want you to be
disappointed in me Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not going to be disappointed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want to just impress you, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I want to impress you, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want to get new hunger
Josie by you man, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I know how Josie
your Japanese is, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't reach that level right now, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're like trying to
impress your dad is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> come on man, this is the only
time I go get my dad's love. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what it is about
talking to a Japanese person, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though it's even more awkward </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause if they don't
understand me, we're fucked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's less awkward because they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> inherently expect me to be fucking awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it's like when I do do
good, it's like, Oh awesome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's good but- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So why don't you just put that on me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you can pretty figure
out what I'm trying to say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you can be like are you
trying to say this Connor but... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I can also just pretend to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess maybe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (speaks in a foreign language) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The point is in general, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we don't really get to talk to as many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese people as I
think people expect us to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> - This is limited quantities
by the way, limited numbers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And there is a name for this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going to attempt to pronounce it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a Welsh town name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh)

<SPEAKER_00> It was perfect. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> Ichimangosenyonhyakukyuujuuhachi-kei </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you need a lot of
space on the shelf for this one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it looks neat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm going to pretend to
have an opinion on (mumbles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Strike witches. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Nevermind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know what that is. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> (mumbles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The Tommy galaxy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Back to the video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was, you could
understand everything, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you think you were
going to talk more Japanese, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like be forced to when you moved here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You said that with
such remorse, like, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because, it's so, it's weird, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I think everyone
in my life expected me to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as did I, but what ends
up happening is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I realized, okay, I work from home, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I go to a language school where
all the staff speak English </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all my friends speak English. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh no, I stream, I speak in English. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I go to the gym, I don't talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because who the fuck
am I going to talk to? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Unless that whole guy talks to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The fucking massive challenge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have I told that story? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I have, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So yeah, there's actually like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty much no time where I- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Although to be fair I'm
kind of the same as well like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, well, how often
do you speak Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people outside of business? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because of COVID I haven't
been able to see my family, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right, yeah that
as well as maybe even worse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because strangers don't
want to talk to foreigners. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean like our neighbor, next to us, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is like really fucking cool old couple </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like every time I see them like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll talk to them in Japanese, but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I always get so nervous because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the moment I start talking to them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can hear it in my inflection that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh no, I'm fucking like losing
touch on this shit like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I haven't been speaking it enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I haven't been speaking enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause all, 'cause the only
time I'll ever speak is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with my mom, like an occasional
Skype call or fucking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's weirder you live
in Japan and you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're losing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm losing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So I have to, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I have to like consciously fucking keep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figuring out ways of like, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how can I use this language? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Because if there's one
thing I don't want to lose </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's my Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Of course.
- Yeah, of course, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the thing about languages is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if you don't use it, it'll get rusty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's true with like my Thai as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now that I'm living out
of Thailand, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's sometimes I'm trying
to remember a Thai word </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when I'm speaking to my mom </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and sometimes I get like
the Japanese word instead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that's something I've
been studying more recently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah and it's weird to
think how little I can have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how little I can use
Japanese and also live here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you kind of
subconsciously find a way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to make it easy for yourself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not going to lie the one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually like one thing I have
been starting to do recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is like every time I
read Mongo or a novel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a Japanese novel or
something I read it out loud. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just because if I read in my head, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like of course I'm going to understand it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's completely different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like reading and speaking skills
it's completely different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I've liked just kind of
very quietly read it to myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just to remember like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, that's how you pronounce that word. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like that
for me, like reading Welsh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like getting confusing now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I haven't done it in a long time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, you've seen the
Welsh language, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fucking jumble of sounds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, all right fucker- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why I don't understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people who know like
fucking eight languages. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some people just have it, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just a capacity, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I don't think inherently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I would ever learn more than one language </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'm lazy as fuck I'll be honest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I mean the thing is- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But the fact I'm try to
pick up a third it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fuck, my brain is like
Connor, we're really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we're really going on limit here, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're really pushing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I don't think learning
languages is hard per se. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's just like,
okay, if we just all quit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> YouTube tomorrow for like a year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just focused all our time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on actually learning this language. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like we'd made
like so much progress, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but what's hard about it is
trying to learn a language </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and fit it within our
already current lifestyle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where we already busy as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like that's the real problem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's like, I'm
trying to find time where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> time doesn't fucking exist nowadays, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where like it takes a lot of
fucking time and dedication </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to learn a language. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's a long line between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> being able to speak a
language conversationally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and being fluent in the language. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The only time I've actually
gotten like able to being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get proper Japanese practice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is when we're fucking out
on the lash or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're at a random bond with like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where we were fucking
pissed out of our heads </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there was just a random Japanese bloke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who's as pissed as us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That's pretty much been
like the best language </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> practice I've gotten
since I've moved here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That probably is the best way to do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because if you're like
a little intoxicated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> then you're going to be less
nervous about trying out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, I swear to God,
I speak any languages </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like 10% better when I'm
drunk, except for English. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Except English, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Except English. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - True, true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I mean like languages
from what I've learned is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> learning a language and learning
music or like an instrument </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the exact same part of the brain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Fuck.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they say like, it's
exact same with any instrument </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or language, but the second
one is always going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be the most difficult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then from the third onwards, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just gets easier and easier and easier. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I guess for all, for all three of us, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the advantage is that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we already know two
languages quite fluently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that's why, and you guys
are learning a third, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it just puts pressure on me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like maybe I should learn
a third language as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's weird
because I don't feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I ever learned two languages. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is the first time
I've felt like I've learned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to learn actively
learn something where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rather than just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hey, this is I just knew this as a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't really have to think about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause you don't think about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in your head when you speak Thai or Welsh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause the
thing is, it's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is very much like
learning an instrument, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just a lot of it's
like muscle memory. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is pure muscle memory. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I do not remember how I learned it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't remember learning it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I Just know that I've always
been able to understand it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and speak it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why I hate it
when people ask me like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese language questions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, I don't fucking
know how I know this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's also like when I... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And also when you learn
a language natively </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think you learn it wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You learn it locally and in a native way- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - People will ask me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some people would ask
me questions about Welsh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'd be like, I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just knew from speaking it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know any of the rules. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't do half of them correctly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh that's why they
say like the best way to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> learn any language is to live
in the country that speaks it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's, yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think I get a lot
of questions about like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh wait, wait, which
languages do Connor speak. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, it's 'cause like
I don't really get much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> use out of Welsh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really show it
off much unfortunately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's only spoken in Wales </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and one part of like South America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that really?
- There's a really small </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> place in somewhere in South America </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they speak Welsh like a town. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really?
- Weird, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Bachelor of Welsh shirtless went there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and were like, fuck it
let's just a make a town. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's just do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's such a nice language,
it's so beautiful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fucking love the Welsh language, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's always fun hearing people pronounce </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the names of the towns. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Isn't that, that Buzzfeed video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with like all the Welsh names
and it's fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They sound as cool as they look as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because like my
dad can't speak Welsh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my mum can speak Welsh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So my dad fucking butchers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the names and I always just correct him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fine, I just want
to be an ass and like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, I do that to my
dad with Japanese as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I fucking love doing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, it's the same situation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, he's like, shut up son. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Going back to the whole
like trying to fit in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around your lifestyle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There is such a big part of
me that's like, fuck man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wish I could just take a year
off YouTube and like do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like perfect a skill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just do Japanese class five days a week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've like felt that
definitely recently where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like my entire life has
just revolved around YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like the past four, five years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I kind of realized
this last year, especially, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was just like, Hey, there
are other things I can do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with my life other than YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and learning Japanese is
definitely one of them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I've really only have time to do one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> without making like substantial
progress on the other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or just like making them
almost zero progress. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean this COVID situation definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hasn't helped considering
that's really limiting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where we can go, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I feel travel as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if you're traveling with like a bunch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like English speaking people in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you just get into, you can
put yourself into situations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you have to
interact with the locals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Right.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, just travel is such a nice way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of just meeting people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like getting to use the
language as much as possible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because like, I feel there's less stress </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> using a language you're trying to learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while you're traveling
because at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're never going to
meet this person again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I would have no qualms about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like butchering Japanese to
an old lady who's selling- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you get fucking nervous as shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to use Japanese
at your local Konbini. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going to see you again
probably tomorrow same time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I don't want to be remembered </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as like guys who can't
speak Japanese, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - As much as there's a part
of me that wants to do that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like at the same time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like I'm enjoying
YouTube now more than ever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm enjoying everything about
it and it's going so well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that it would make no sense
to like stop doing, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, 'cause taking a year off YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> although I could probably
come back from it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I probably could.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But is it worth the risk? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like no, probably not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can always learn
Japanese later on in life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which sucks that I wouldn't have it now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I would rather have it now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I can always- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why not mix the two worlds together? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you mean by that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like make some kind of YouTube content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about you learning Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I considered that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I thought that'd be
such a big undertaking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I've seen language channels
and they had like drama </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they would like not
end up learning the language. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh)
No joke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like there was this video where a guy made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like an apology video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it sounds like technical drama. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you know when
those videos went around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where it was like, dude
speaks 15 languages- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're like, well that's just absurd. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then I, sort of watching
a lot of those videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I found like people who were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their whole channel was
about them starting from zero </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then learning the language. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And there was like
drama with this one guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because he was learning
two languages at once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was like, I
can't remember it was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was very different languages as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And about halfway through like a year in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he's like, you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm quitting Swedish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I realized that it's just
hampering my progress </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to learn two languages at once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
And although, it was like the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the comments were
like, what the fuck man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can believe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I believed in you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like your Swedish was so good, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why are you... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, and I was like, Whoa, whoa! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, anything can be drama now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I just thought like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if anything, it would be a thing where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I would be like, okay, let's
see how much I can learn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in three months doing X a week, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I would not announce it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not make it a prop, not make
it a series just, here we go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But at the same time, it
also is a lot of pressure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is like, okay, I've got to worry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about making other videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and also actually learning Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Otherwise this video is
going to be a little awkward </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if it's like three months
in I learn nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh)
Fuck! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that would be funny, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it would be like a funny conclusion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the video as well.
- Wouldn't it though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just wasted three months of my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I learnt nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did it for good content though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wasted 30 minutes of your
life watching this video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, fuck dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I had this video
idea where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I've always wanted to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> improve more on my Japanese as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm like, I can't just like commit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like outside of YouTube or like outside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of what I do on all
these side projects I do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm just way too busy now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which sucks because I
really do want to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hone in on my Japanese a lot more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I thought about like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like the Kanji proficiency test. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I've got like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got like the third highest on that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like that was back
in like high school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But I'm like, I wonder if I can
like go for the highest one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How many counters do you go? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For the highest one?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I believe it's 3000. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think only 0.4% of
the population has it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, it's very like prestigious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I thought like what
if I did a video where I- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is there a Kanji for cultural cons- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guarantee there is, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a Kanji for
everything man, don't worry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I thought to myself, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wonder if I did a
video where I just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> dedicated like a year
to just document myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like learning that and trying
to attempt for the test. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But isn't that scary though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because what if you
don't make any progress </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like six months in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the only thing
that's stopping me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is like fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's also like in order for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in order for this video to be successful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've got to fucking grind this shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And if I do this and
then the video flops, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then that's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cool, I wasted a year of my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for a flopped video and
a test that I failed in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think unlike the
actual Japanese language, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think you actually can like
game-ify and speed run Kanji. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I think Kanji is speed runnable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know man.
- It is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Dude, totally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Explain, explain.
- Explain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because you can, this
there's like little apps </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that will like fucking whip
you if you get it wrong, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So I I've speed learned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 100 Kanji in like a day by doing that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I know all of them now I can use them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But if I sat you down and
told you to write it out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> could you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Write it out, some of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, that's the thing.
- Or read them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I mean, Japanese- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, and read them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Would you be able to read a
hundred Kanji if I showed you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - A hundred percent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- A hundred percent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, now I'm tempted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Now I'm tempted.
- Challenge, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> challenge accepted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm tempted to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We do a live stream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We'll both stream, you could fucking do- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, and I'll
do a Kanji test on you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The basic Kanji? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The hundred Kanji you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll do a test. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A hundred percent we'll do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, okay.
- Easy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Because-
- Sounds like a video already. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because right, you can gamify it like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you can start
picking up patterns. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like the way
that you can, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> At least when I was, when
I was learning Kanji, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I could easily pick up Kanji like I guess, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause especially living in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it wasn't like,
living in the UK, sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where will you learn this Kanji
you would leave your house, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you wouldn't see it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you leave your house in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if you didn't talk to anyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you see the Kanjis everywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you could keep practicing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you keep seeing
them like, Oh, I know that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, I know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you do do that
after like every like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Trash Taste session we
be catching the train, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd be like, what's that sign say? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen that one before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I feel like that's how though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the way you got to do it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause that's how a kid learns </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just like through quizzes differently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Problem is, is where it starts getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> into like this four
Kanji with four different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or the same Kanji with like
10 different pronunciations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, oh, oh, this is- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is like 30% of all Kanji. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love the ones with
like two I'm like nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Question for you boys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause we've been living
here for a year now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How long do you think
you'll be staying here for? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the question
I want to ask you too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's my five-year plan? (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Chris Broads is a fucking liar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Chris Broads said he
wasn't going to live here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for like five years and he's still here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Motherfucking liar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's been here for eight years I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What a fucking liar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I'm approaching my fifth year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, time just moves fucking fast, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it doesn't even feel like
I've been here a year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought, yeah, I'll live
here for like two years max, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm halfway through, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've hardly even spent
any time and I feel like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like I always thought
to myself, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought about it I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God, I've been here
for almost five years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Five year old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, since I moved out and moved out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of my parents and like actually
leaved in Japan on my own. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, it does feel like five years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is why, like, the question of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you see yourself
doing in five years? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's starting to sound
less and less absurd to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because back, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I was in my teenage
years, the people were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where do you see yourself in five years? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like five years is so far. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You've be doing something
fucking different every year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Back at that age. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But now it just feels like
it's you can have like a- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Difference-
- Routine and monotonous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now we just sound old, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We are, man, we are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Depending on how long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a big fucking question mark obviously is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> how long will Geex+ allow
us to be here because we're- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Meilyne.
- Yeah, Meilyne. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'ma calling you out right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How long? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I'm going to say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to say this louder. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So it all depends on how
long Geex+ will be around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because our visa depends on Geex+. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Meilyne] No, no, it
depends on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs)
- Wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This (indistinct) takes
so many fucking sponsors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by the way, we can give Geex+ money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So that we can susciate
how fucking like loads. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Overloads. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How many sponsors can we fit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 10 an episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Say no more.
- Doable, doable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Man, I mean- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I mean, like the question though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think, and this is kind of
goes back to the root of it all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having been here for a year,
are you guys enjoying it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's been, I think I flip flop a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the first six months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> The first six months I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would have one week
where I'm like, I hate it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I plan to go back in two months. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- I obviously not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like there's some weeks where
I think especially where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I said this in my video about my... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I made a video about
one year living in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the big point I
tried to mention was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to make like,
you have to force yourself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like actively go out your
way to make friends here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is not a country where
friends just come along. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't just bump into
people and you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, let's hang out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, you act like you
have to go out of your way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to do the whole, like, when are you free? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> What's your calendar like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's make the solid,
not a bullshit thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's do it otherwise, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not going to see anyone for two weeks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Expect for you guys, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And like having this podcast
has really helped because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> before it was like, okay,
we might hang out every day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then we also might not see each other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like a week and a half. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I realized I haven't
left the house in four days, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> fuck, I'm starting to feel lonely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I live alone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I've never lived like alone, alone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We've always had a
roommate or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've always had a roommate or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I didn't realize like how
much I like relied on that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like kind of keep me a little bit sane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because you know sometimes
my fucking roommate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Xina, I love you but yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You fucking, you drive
me up the wall, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But that's not, that's
also not like her fault, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like just a thing of life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That comes with just having a roommate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Eventually you just, you
live with someone long enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like, I fucking hate
just a little thing that you do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I have no idea why and
I thought I can live alone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I like one week
into living alone I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> fuck, it's quiet in here, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Jesus! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was so fucking depressed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when I started living alone here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like before Archie moved in
with me, I was like, fuck man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't been out of
the house in two weeks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm so fucking lonely right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And like-
- Oh my. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Am I the only true introvert here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like my time alone,
don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like my time alone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But there's only so much
time I like alone. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Before I'm like, I require
the touch of a human skin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I remember before I moved to Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I basically lived alone for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like three four months. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because Sydney was in America at the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we were sorting out
our visa stuff with Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that was just like, like
a fair few month period </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where my only social life would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when we be able to like
hang out in London. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I don't know if it's just because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been in a relationship
for like four years, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was just like nice having, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like just living alone
and just seeing friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and seeing people when I wanted to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I guess the big
difference between Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and when I was living in England is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could see someone whenever
I wanted to in England </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I really wanted to,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you could just message me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we could just hang out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Exactly, I feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it was the case of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know when I'm
going to see someone next </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then I would be a way more lonely- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why I'm like constantly
just like filling in plans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like ahead of time just being like, yo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you want to hang out? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You want to hang out? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You want to hang out? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Otherwise you're going to find
yourself in this kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dead space of just no
interaction whatsoever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because like
when I first moved here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I didn't really have
anything in my house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and yeah I was just going on Tinder dates, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just because I was lonely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't, like, it sounds
so sad but what I did- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't think people could do that man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And when I didn't have anything to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I would just go to your house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then I felt bad, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I didn't want to go
to their house every day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know you didn't
mind, but I also didn't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I felt like I was intruding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- So, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was just sad, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it took me a while to get used to it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and getting used to being alone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck, that sounds so sad.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> No, I mean living alone, sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not being alone. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just have to get used
to just being in my soul- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just crying.
- Just crying like it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I've I figured it out now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I figured out how to have a
healthy balance of everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it took me a while
because I wasn't used to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I always had someone in my house </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I could always be like,
yo, you want to watch TV? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So is this your subtle way of asking us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to come house more often? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no.
- Please. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So like, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So we're going back to
our original fucking topic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of this video of like online
friends and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When did you guys
realize that online friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just wasn't enough? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They couldn't feel that whole, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that having real physical
friends that you can see, like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - After I had like a really
healthy friend group I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - An IRL friend group?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah after you have
like an actually good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> IRL friend group that like, you just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you would rather hang out
with more than like anyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like there's no going back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel that as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I found like my first
proper true friend group, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like at the age of like 23, 24 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's when it kind of started. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember like my mom had
like up my entire perception </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because my mom had raised
me for like 18 years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to be like, don't give a shit
about your high school friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that your real friends for life, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your actual real friends
will come in university. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So I go to (clears throat) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I go to university and
I'm just there with like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my housemates, my course
mates I'm just looking around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like I
hate everyone around me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're like Michael Zlasky's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where are the friends? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you're just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where are the friends? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Mom? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Why would you lie to me, mom? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why would you lie to me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, yeah, I'm not in
contact with like anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from like my university days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like some more so in my high school days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where the university was
just, university was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a fucking cesspool where I was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I definitely have more in contact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with my high school friends
than I do my uni friends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like not to say I don't
have any uni friends, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I've, you know, some of
my uni friends are fucking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> best friends forever, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't know like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that whole thing of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh don't worry about high school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they won't be a friends for life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that's kind of bullshit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- I think you'll you'll know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you've made a friend for life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
- I think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There is no designated time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when you will make friends for life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it will happen along the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I remember like finding
my first friend group </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and now I was just realizing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, so I don't have to pretend to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone likable to be around you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you guys just kind of
liked me for the person I am. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And that was just like,
so mind blowing for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What the fuck is that all about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh)
- I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like having friends
that are like, just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> even though there's like a
lot of people it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's there to help each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if you're having a low point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the whole philosophy
of God, you're a con, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but I love you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and just like mates
that are just there for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, regardless of like, what's going on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, and I really,
really, really value that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's a shame as well because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking hate texting so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I absolutely despise texting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, same here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I pretty much
the only people I text, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are like people I know that
I'm going to meet up with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm like, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When we meet out what's happening? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like or it's like business or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But outside of that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I avoid it like the plague
because I just hate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why do you hate it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It doesn't feel genuine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it takes so long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, I'd rather
have a 30 minute call </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than text for like a
whole day back and forth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Same here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I mean, I'm sure you both know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm fucking awful at replying- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh Garnt is fucking worse bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that's because like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for me it takes like so much
mental energy to like be on it- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I get it, I get it.
- And look at notifications. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just have to like have a dedicated time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I check messages, otherwise one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just get distracted
from whatever I'm doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I much rather, I value
so much having like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just an in-person or like an in voice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like actual communication,
because there's so much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I can't communicate when it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> during texts that I just
rather talk to people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel that so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I get that, I get that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of context is almost
lost as well when you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just texting as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It can't be like all the
emotions can't be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> portrayed properly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and I kind of realized as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that the friends you'll have in life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the ones that like, I
might not text right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like the real friends are the ones where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't fucking need to text them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like even for a year or two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But when I go back, I have nothing- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's exactly the same.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's exactly the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The way I see it is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of like a family reunion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I didn't fully understand the term </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where it was just like friends
are the family you choose </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until I had a proper friend group. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I was just like,
I remember hearing that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for like my entire life and
thinking that's such a bullshit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like this like cheesy Disney movie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) that isn't actually real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a fucking urban myth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a fucking urban legend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It wasn't the destination, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was the friends that
I made along the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (harmonizes) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, with that being said
back to the question at hand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which was, how long are you
gonna stay in Japan for? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What do you think? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What do you think boys? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I think right now
my main thing is that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the end of the day, with
all my gripes that I had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I I've made them very known, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as the comments like to point out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they think I despise Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm very critical to everything in life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And at the end of the day, Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the standard of living is just
much higher at the moment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Especially when you're British </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just learn to complain
about all the little. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, a lot of people just think that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I really see a lot of comments like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor's so fucking rude about Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, no I'm just British. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it's just being real, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just being real.
- It's just being British. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's no perfect
country out there man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We complain about everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And, okay, here's the
question to you guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, we all are living in the place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is not where we were born. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you always know that you would move </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out of your home country
and live somewhere else? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like, at least for me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I moved out of the house
that I was born in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I never moved until
I moved out of my home. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I've been living in that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what, like my parents' house
for late 21 years straight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was just like, yeah, it's home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's also like, you know, you go home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you just see the same view </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> out of the window every day, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I need something else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love my home, don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think, especially
because I was so active online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from such a young age, I
became so like globally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of other different places. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right, right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then it just made
me curious I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Going back to my fucking mom, it was just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember like when I was
a kid, I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mom, I'm telling you
this now love England's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm going to move out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Three-year-old Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, seriously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between like when I was like going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from a kid to a teenager, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking knew that I would like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> move out of England eventually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, mom, don't
take this personally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just going to move out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not going to be in the country </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and mum was like, sure, sure bet, bet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, son whatever you say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I remember when I told her, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hey mom, I'm just going
to like fucking move </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to Thailand for a few years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She was like, surprised Pikachu face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, (gasps) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, Oh, you, you were actually
serious all of these years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, because like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> not that I don't love England, but one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanted to experience
like different cultures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything since I was a fucking kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And two like, I don't know, I was always, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my head I was always thinking that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was this perfect place to live. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That wasn't the place that you were from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because everywhere else
seems so exotic right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like the more I move
around, the less idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have about where I truly
want to fucking settle down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's really weird, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because especially if you live like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stay in a place for like any
substantial amount of time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you see all the great things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that are there and you
also see the bad things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no fucking perfect place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the more you move around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the more you realize
there is no perfect place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So where you got to make
that decision of, Hey, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what is actually best for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Legit one, between the
ages of like 12 and 16 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought America was the perfect place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought America was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I really wanted to live in America </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all my life until like age, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably actually until
like I moved to Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I still like, before that, I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I kinda just don't want
him to go to America, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Always since a young age, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd always been exposed
to American culture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I always spoke with Americans online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just really loved
their style of doing things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I loved how fucking crazy they are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's because for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like, I didn't really like
interact with any Americans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because like, literally from age 12 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been chatting to people online, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always voice chatting like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my parents, for some
reason didn't stop me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - All you did was random Americans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And most of the online friends you got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were just from America, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah a lot of them were. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of the people
you were friends with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were from America so- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was the token British
friend, most of the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were like, it's fucking Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (screams)
(speaking simultaneously) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, we were cool back then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we were. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was when we were respected online. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - God, I miss those days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now it's all fucking memes
and bad teeth and shoes day. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> - I would never let my kid do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would never let my kid do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why I did it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Your parents were just cool with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Were your parents aware of it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I didn't tell them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would just tell my mother
that I was talking to my friend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like, who you who... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So when I used to swear, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I lived, I lived. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> My room is upstairs, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So whenever I swore too loud
and my parents heard it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would hear this at the stairs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (taps desk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, Connor! Stop swearing! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because my dad swore a bunch, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But he tried not to around
me but I fucking I was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I could not stop swearing over an Xbox. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, cause you're that
one angry kid on Xbox. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because right, if you wanted any credit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as a 13 year old, you had to curse, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You gotta talk shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I can't relate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you ever given any
13 year old kid credit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> now that you're in the opposite end? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- If they shout. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But when you're that age,
I hate to be a bit fat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, British Xbox is a different beast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever the you had, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was 'cause everyone in these
lobbies was like 13, 14, 15. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now that sounds like these- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no that sounds
like every Xbox lobbies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so half the games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would enjoy the fucking game more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I was fucking screaming at someone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then for some reason I enjoyed- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You were legit that one squeaker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I wasn't... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Was I squeaking then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe I was squeaking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Who knows? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You were a cold squeaker.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, God! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My God! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - See, don't VA confirmed called squeaker. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, that was so funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So many dumb, so much
dumb shit I did on Xbox. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my gosh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So here's the question
now then, now that we've, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> now that you've like gone
to Japan and gone to America </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and these are like the two places </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you really like, kind
of like fantasize about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when you were younger, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is there any place in the world
that you still want to go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or is it all just like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, what's on everyone's
like country bucket list? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or is it all just downhill from here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I've been everywhere I want to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's nowhere else I want to go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Not really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Here's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because people like
say, I want to go here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I want to go here like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's some countries, people like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I really want to go here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why the fuck would you want to go there? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like where?
(all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not going to name any names. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just take a sample. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is going to sound
fucking terrible, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There are some countries right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like, not going to lie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I want to vacation somewhere, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to know that I can
shit in a clean toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, I'm just going to say, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that a bad thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Am I allowed to say that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a very privileged thing to say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's hella privileged. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I know it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But at the end of the day,
I'm just going to be honest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want to fucking shit
in the hole in the ground, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's too much.
- Okay, no it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you never get used to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you ever had to use the
hole in the ground toilet? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, in France I had to and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought this was a
fucking civilized country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, this is like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I used to go camping so much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so like shitting in a hole
was just normal for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because, right, I spoke to Allen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm sure when he
comes on the podcast, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he can tell about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He can tell the stories about how his dad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> forced him to go to Kenya on holiday. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he made it sound
like it was fucking hell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, why the
fuck would I want to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on vacation there? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> When everything sounds horrible? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, if I vacation, all
I want to do is just relax </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just chill out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want to fucking do activities. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to fucking ride camels. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want to fucking be uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You sound like my granddad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, I'm already
accepted that I am like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a 60 year old white dude
when it comes to holidays. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, you just don't
want to like adventure- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't wanna.
- In another country, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm a hundred percent with Connor on this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm fine with doing an
activity on a day or two, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe we can hike but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I do not want to fucking
do shit every day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I also don't want to have to like just- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't want to have pressure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I need to go see something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I'm in a place and I'm
just like you need to go here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you need to go there,
you need to see this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, I hate it already. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I will go to one cool place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just like, I've
seen enough, I'm satisfied. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Can I just go home </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just like fucking
enjoy a pint or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But that's my perfect holiday. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it doesn't come from a place of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe it does come from
a place of privilege. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Probably it does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I honestly don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want to chill on my holidays. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it was just 'cause of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what I went through as a kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause when you go on
holiday as a kid, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You got to follow what everyone else says. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I always like had this fucking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if I go into like a big group, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this start fucking itinerary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where all I wanted to do was
just stay in my fucking hotel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> room and play my Nintendo DS. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all I wanted to
fucking do on holidays. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because we used to, I
used to go camping in France </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I said, every year for three weeks, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right?
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And most years I fucking hated it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And my parents thought that I
was just like, they thought... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, I get it now what
they think, they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, he's just saying he hates it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like that's what parents think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> No, I actually- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's just a (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I actually hated it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like, you were in a tent, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you were sleeping on the floor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's like three weeks,
you're eating the same shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like everything is- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Okay, to be fair- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everything is grilled on a barbecue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love camping don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I used to like, my dad
used to take me camping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like in the fucking Australian
Outback all the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it wasn't for three weeks, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like tops, like five days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the thing, right, I think those- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Three weeks is way too long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that was like
has completely put me off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> vacationing in any places
that aren't just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> honestly, just like relaxing in a nice bed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just eating nice food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like that kind of like put me off for life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because I spent most
of my childhood summers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just sleeping on the floor, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eating everything that had to be grilled </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because that's all you had to cook, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It was a grill, eating baguettes nonstop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then always there's
horrible public showers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that are never clean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then sometimes you would see like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> piss in the corner and
it would always smell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was just awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like everything was awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And even as a 12 year
old, I could be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is this some peasant joke? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm too rigid to understand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I would just be like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That would turn me off as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would always be like,
at home we had a toilet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was nice and it didn't
stink of just everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Why does it here?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I also wonder how
different my perceptions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of a lot of these activities would be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I actually went nowadays. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now I would love with my mates. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - With my mates because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But not for three weeks. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Part of the reason I like
looked back and dread about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is because you spent it with,
you were forced to be there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with like your family and something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you wanted to do something else </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that your family didn't want to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like that's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that kind of memory has
been ingrained into me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I just like, I hate this activity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I did that shit
as a kid and I hated it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because my parents
were obsessed with like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> maximizing the fuck out of the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it was like, let's go... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If we got in France, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, let's just walk
around this town all day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, fuck no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to go to the arcade all day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to walk all day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I'm still at the age
where walking just hurts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Right, right, right.
(Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All day, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like for some reason
when you're a kid like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> walking long distances, just doesn't work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or like, were you an active kid? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A hundred percent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I was doing sports
two, three times a week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh okay, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But for some reason- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just walking is yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When I had to walk all day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just pain.
- [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was just pain, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] And then like-
- Pain pickle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then when you're a kid, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> There's nothing more boring than fishing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would have to do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's true.
- And I thought- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm glad my dad never
got me into fishing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like my dad fucking despised fishing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's something that I
could see me enjoying now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with a mate and drinking a few pints. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've actually been fishing
for the first time recently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was like two years
ago with Sydney's dad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Sydney's a brother took
me fishing for the first time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I actually really fucking enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, as an adult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's one of those
things that like as a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just not wired to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There...
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is going to make me sound so bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But there is one big difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about why I can enjoy it now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> versus why I couldn't enjoy as a kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's because
alcohol is now involved. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have never seen a man fish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with not a beer in that little pocket. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It doesn't happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I mean, you had,
it's not part of the charm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like going in as a kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it is just like, it's the ADHD simulator. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because all you want to do is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> why is there not fish
catching on this immediately? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, I'm trying to get this
fucking thing on the thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and my, fucking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Where's my Nintendo DS, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to fucking play cooking
mama for 20 minutes to relax. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You trying to do it and nothing happens, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get shit fish. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And as a kid, you're like,
let's kill it and eat it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let's just do something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let's fucking decapitate this fish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then is that your dad's
like, we threw back in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, what's the point? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to eat it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you're a kid and you
think in every video game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've caught it and I've eat it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why are you stopping me dad? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the worst activity for a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It doesn't make sense
and just the whole thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just completely ruined, like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing that kind of stuff
for me as an adult now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because I have just no interest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would actually go back
fishing with my mates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was just like
a nice male bonding sesh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We should go fishing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would be happy to go
fishing with you boys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I haven't been fishing
in for like five years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I will tell you what,
because I've had this image </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of what fishing would
be like my entire life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And because like my only
experience with fishing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my entire life has been through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the fucking fish and mini games you get in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every fucking Zelda game or every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's in animal crossing, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can play for the free controller. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I thought to myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no way it's going to be like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was fucking surprised </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at how accurate that simulation is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, it literally felt
like a controller rumble </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, Oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, this is just like
the fucking video games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you're just like, where's the a bus? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's literally just instead
of tapping the a bus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you just go (hisses) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But for some reason it was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was very therapeutic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and if you like fishing mini games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's exactly like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was surprised, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every like fishing enthusiast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is just like frothing at the mapping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like how fucking dare he say that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Man, yeah, I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just it's completely like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so to answer your question
Joey, oh God, sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> No, I think there's not
many any other countries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I'm like desperate to go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Obviously I've never been to any of Asia, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I really want to explore a lot more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Hmm.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like there's so many activities
that I like the idea of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I like the idea of
camping, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The idea- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Two days, two days, max. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's charming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The idea sounds cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until you fucking wake up and it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the fucking worst thing I
hate is when you wake up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and everything it's just dump
you feel things and it's dump </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and dump is like the
worst fucking climate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everything's damp and
moist and I'm depressed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's cloudy and I'm
just like, why am I here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I chose to be here, this
is supposed to be relaxing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh dude, then you should
come camping in Australia, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like fucking dries in there all year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but than everything
wants to fucking kill you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I have something else to worry about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Only if you go out and
fuck with the animals, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't fuck with the animals
and they'll leave you alone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause camping in the UK is just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> either fucking cold as
shit or just damp as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, not gonna lie camping in the UK </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sounds fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, because we have to do a thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in the UK called like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, you don't have to
do it, it's optional. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Duke of Edinburgh, did you do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My sister did that.
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, where you basically
like have to do a bunch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of things to get a fucking stupid award- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like go out camping and
hiking and shit, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they always told you in school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, you should get it because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's going to look amazing
when you apply for jobs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and no one-
- No one cares. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No one cares, no one cares. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And on it like, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to do like a hiking
slash camping thing where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> do two days of like full hiking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like the big bags and then camp. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is going to sound
like so fucking stupid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was the only one who was
like, I'm bringing a pillow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to be comfortable when I sleep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The privileged white boy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I big brained it, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because all these kids
brought like dumb shit, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And we had to, we brought like
a stove to cook on as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We were like 16 as well so, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I brought the pillow, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And as I was sleeping, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they'll start fucking
trying to take it from me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause they were sleeping
on the hard floor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with a t-shirt rolled up and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm the one who was the stupid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dick who carried this pillow all the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like eight hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is my pillow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is my reward. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I woke up and one of
them had fucking took it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I woke up on the thing
covered in fucking dampness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, Oh my God
did it rain bear in mind, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the three person
tent, with four of us in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I woke up, being like oh my God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it must have rained so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I go outside, it's completely dry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, Oh, it was sweat! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It was all sweat! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was all condensation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (screams) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause my sister
did Duke of Edinburgh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but she did like the highest level. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So she like hiked- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like a week, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, she hiked across Vietnam twice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would you want to do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> She did it twice though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did two days and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think, no, this isn't for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to go back to sitting on the bed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and watching anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing)
I think that, I just.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> This isn't for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why did you even decide to do it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, because it's one of
those things where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can do it.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you ask me to go hiking
for a week, I'll do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm very capable of doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just hate every second of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, then why do you accept it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - All my parents were
like, you should do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like fine, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was doing the other
stuff anyway, because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was teaching kids
chess at my old school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know man, like
I knew from the get-go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when like the option was brought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up of dude, would you like
to do Duke of Edinburgh? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Would you like to go hiking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and fucking experience
dampness for a week straight? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, no.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, of course I don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think because it's wild, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they wanted like the kids who had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of experience camping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to help the kids who hadn't done any. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was only like,
there was only like three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or four boys and like the
boy Scouts in like my year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then there was like me
who done a lot of camping. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was like, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you were the experience camper. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess, yeah to me it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Connor should help out and join. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You were the boy scout, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I never did any like map
direction or anything like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my parents fucking did all that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I barely helped with
setting up the tents. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just put the bag down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I used to be like, Oh, I'm
gonna go play with the Frisbee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So when we did it, I do
remember this as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like when it came, I was
like, I'll do the cooking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can set up the tent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause setting up the tent is... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's 'cause it was one
of the cheap ones as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And the cheap ones are like, (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> connect the 576 poles together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, no, none
of them can get it right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, I'm going to
cook the bacon that I brought. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was yeah, I- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd be down to go
camping though in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never been camping in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Glamping, we should do glamping. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, glamping is cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never gone glamping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like camping without
all the frustration. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like camping with privilege. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like campling with civilization. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> If we didn't want to like
invent all this shit- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's camping with attitude.
- We wouldn't have- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Though I'ma be real, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to camp without 4G. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, what's the point? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I'm just gonna say it, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I know it's not the same,
I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I want 4G. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can camp without 4G. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can camp without 4G.
- That's your problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need a toilet, you're right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Toilets-
- Yeah, toilets. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want to shit in a fucking bag </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or a hole in the ground. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] You haven't been- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a reason fucking humans evolved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and invented toilets and civilization. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you ever wiped
your ass with a leaf? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just doesn't work,
but that's all you have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What you gonna do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Grab a handful of grass? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No you have to use leaves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and hope that you can
just get most of it out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, that's why I like the one thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we always took camping was
like a bunch of toilet rolls. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn dude, 2020 man,
you fucking find some. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because yeah, you'd
go out into the bush, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd wipe yourself, put it in a bag </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you throw all that into a fire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I must've been as like 12 year old me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like instant
noodles or toilet roll? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck dude, I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't eat the toilet roll. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's chicken flavor
though, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on, man.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Chicken flavor or poopy butler. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh God, it was, I do
remember when we did it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there was awful 'cause like
it was a lot of kids that were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just not prepared at all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and had never even done any hiking at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And those things are heavy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and a lot of them just couldn't do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you had to stay as a team </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it was like every 15 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> one kid would have a
fucking mental breakdown </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like-
- I can't do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't hold it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] And I think- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, go on go on, I have nothing to say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So the only thing that like
puts me off camping in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from what I've seen, like,
only like the pictures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything that I've
seen is that it looks very, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> how can I say it's commercialized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's like you have
this like camping spot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like, I see a bunch of tents there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's very privileged. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- And I'm just like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're put right next to someone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's just, I remember the one thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember about camping is just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how little noise protection you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> from one tent to another, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You hear everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And especially the, what I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially the camping
experience I would like to have, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like a bonding mate sesh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially if you have like
a bunch of Japanese people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around you with tents and
everyone values their privacy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can you imagine how
quiet you'd have to be? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or we could just be
those like ignorant guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no, one's making noise at this campsite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, I think we will like fuck it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What are they going to say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just hit like at 2:00 AM </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like aggressive Uno
noises like from drunk people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking Jojo Uno's session </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at two in the morning in a tent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We should do Trash Taste hiking special. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd be down, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I used to go hiking all the fucking time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know what the worst part is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's actually not a bad idea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
(Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd be down dude, I'd be down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's all about, I'd
be willing to do it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it for content? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, I'm willing to fucking
suffer for content whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am, I am, I am. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the tipping point, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It looks like I'll do
it, but is it monetized? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, all right, I'll do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did we get on talking about camping? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah, what the fuck
were we talking about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh yeah, if you're going
to stay in Japan or not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, well, I mean- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It was that which country would you visit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, is there a country that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the top of your bucket list
right now for like visiting? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Korea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Korea, Korea.
- Korea? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I really want
to go to South Korea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For me it's Iceland. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Iceland? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love everything about that country. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The language, just the
culture around I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the places I've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's such a tiny country, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's like, if you have
a car you could fucking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and you have a week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can probably visit
most of that country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do wanna go Mexico. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But a lot of people I know
who are Mexican, who are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, its dangerous as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's what I've heard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, Oh okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I really like how safe it is here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly, exactly.
(all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's like, food's amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Really good time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just really fucking dangerous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is there one for you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you have like a bucket list of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna go to this country. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, probably Iceland is at the top. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I do wanna really go
back to Korea as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've only been there for like a few days, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but I feel like that just
wasn't enough time for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I'd love to go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Thailand as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's just throw away, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really wanna go to Thailand as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, Thailand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I definitely want to go
to Southeast Asia more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, I want to
go to Vietnam as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you ever been to Singapore
either or Malaysia or any, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have you ever been anywhere
in Asia except for Japan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- So I really want to be- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - See like, I want to
travel more around Asia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I feel like there's only a few </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Asian countries that
I haven't visited yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 2020 psych. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Trash Taste, South Asian tour. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I mean, I do want to
visit just everywhere really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and just make my own... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I joke and say just
that I don't want to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to a lot of places but
I wouldn't mind going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and passing through and checking it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like Egypt, I really want to go to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Algeria I really wanna go to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Australia, I really
want to go to Australia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - South Africa, I really wanna go to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was joking about Kenya, but, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure I can have a nice time there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just being ignorant as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure there's going to be
comments saying that I am. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I've always thought like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ah, I don't really want to
like visit like this place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like Africa, for instance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or like the middle East
and stuff like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but like the more I kind
of hear about those places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> from people who are either from there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or just from shit you see, it's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- You know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That actually might be kind of dope. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's just, it's such a toss up though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there's a lot of those countries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we just hear nothing about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are we hearing nothing
about it because it's bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or because people just don't go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Austria is like a country
you don't hear much about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's pretty nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really like Austria. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Austria is super chill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You go skiing there, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I've been skiing in Austria </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and snowboarding in Italy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's really nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just skiing in Europe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or snowboarding in Europe
in general it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's super expensive,
but it's really nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really want to do it.
- It's really nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I just want to go to Europe more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, everything's just
super fucking expensive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is just like a travel wishlist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> This is just us
fantasizing in COVID times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Remember before COVID existed
and we could travel to places. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Remember when I could see my family. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I do want to go back
home and visit my family </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause this will be like the second </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Christmas in a row where
I haven't seen them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is normally would be
the thing where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, I'll go back for Christmas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All right, fuck it, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, I mean, that's one big thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but as far as living in
Japan goes and I mentioned on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the quality of life
being really good here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I definitely feel like at
least another two years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to stay here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think it'll be a case of in a year, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll know if it's gonna
be another two years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's one of those things where I'll just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as it goes, I'll keep
changing that number. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's how it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like from like with a lot of my friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who are from overseas who live
here or have been living here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's always the case of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right, we'll give us one
more year and see how it goes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then usually like 90% of the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after that year ends up, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> another year? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One more year? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it just keeps going, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's such a pain to move shit back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, is it really
worth the, like moving. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really can't be
bothered with that again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But do you guys feel this as well? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if you guys feel the same, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but like for me this has
been the first year where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what I do actually feels like a career </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as opposed to just me
just being self-employed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> doing my own fucking job that- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I've never been
employed, up until this point so, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just feels good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just feels like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the first time this isn't just a job, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like my career now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't think doing
like doing like YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in your job the environment really matters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you can technically do it anywhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the more like I've done this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the more of like growing
up, the more I realized, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hey, environment really fucking
matters in your workspace. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I remember going, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I remember in university
where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can do YouTube wherever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can do it in my fucking room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I can do it next to my bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I suddenly realized
I need my own fucking office, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need my own fucking space. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to separate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> work and my leisure time because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can survive with it
and you can do it, but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just, they'll end up be a point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you get fucking depressed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and you get tired and it's not healthy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and I mean, it
definitely completely changed my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> productivity but also
just like my enthusiasm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> towards my career and I guess like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it really cemented the
severity of what I do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Of like this isn't just
like a little fun thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you get paid for. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is your job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like this is your career like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> putting food on the table is this now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything you do
revolves around this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And definitely, like
moving to a bigger place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and getting my own like actual work room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has like really cemented that like, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like, yeah, I
can fuck around on camera </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be silly and goofy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- But it's also my job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I can't half-ass this shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I need to be serious about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like that's brought
on an entirely different, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess, layer of enjoyment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I otherwise would
have never experienced. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I don't know, like, I
think it's because as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like all of the topics
that we cover of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the kind of otaku kind of stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like anime kind of
stuff where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Doing it here as
opposed to anywhere else, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just, I think completely different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, it totally is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like one of the biggest
things that I've like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realized this year is
a lot of the mystery, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of like the
mystery and the prestige, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not the prestige, like the mystery around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the anime industry itself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> has kind of like, I see the
anime industry totally different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I remember
before like I moved here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know, as a teenager,
as a kid, you think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe I could like, as a dream job, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can work in anime one time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like you have no fucking clue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what steps you need to take. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I thought you had to be
like incredibly fucking lucky </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like the more I meet people
who work in this industry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the more realized, Oh,
you just need to be here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just need to be here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and know one person and that's enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And sometimes you could fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look up a job on Craigslist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes you just you were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> teaching English or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you just happen to stumble- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just meet a person, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just happen to stumble </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> upon someone who has an opportunity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the biggest advice I can give now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you are interested in working </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in the Japanese anime industry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just the fucking be here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it's like, I've
been surprised at how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like sometimes even how
low the bar of entry is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's like the
bar of entry seems to be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, yeah university degree </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's like the minimum
you have to get a visa </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but aside from that, it's
just kind of being here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just hanging around the right places. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Definitely noticed that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I didn't think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just didn't think it worked that way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought it was just like closed off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to all kinds of foreigners
and anyone else, like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or it took like years and
years of building yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And we would go to those anime studios </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and you just meet a guy
who's like, I'm American. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then you ask, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how did you get this job? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it was like,
you think they just had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the craziest fucking
journey to get here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then they're just like, Craigslist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah then most of the time it's just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, I was just teaching English </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I just saw a job
posting for a random anime job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just went for the
interview and I'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh wait, it was that
easy this entire time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you even speak English- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's literally the McDonald's method. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Of like, I see an ad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll apply for it, fucking why not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You get the job, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh see, I got the job, cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess totally agree
with that in terms of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> all the mystique around it's kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> slowly peeling away, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's hard to summarize all my feelings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about living here and working here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, definitely the
structure has been added </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I don't know if
that's because of Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or because of how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we've scheduled and built
our work environment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Optimized. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, having an
agency here that works with us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and works with anime
has been super helpful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and has helped me feel like a lot more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, like you said structured. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause before this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, I was just kind of
fucking around I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was just hoping that
the cheques kept coming in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right?
(all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, I'll just keep making stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that I really enjoy- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It didn't feel real, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No and I assumed that every, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I assumed that every
year it could be my last. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And now I'm starting
to think, okay, well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as long as I don't do
fucking anything stupid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - As long as none of us- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Making an apology- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - As long as none of us get canceled. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're probably going to be around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for a little bit, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can normally safely assume </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've got a year left in
this industry, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you can probably know
we plan a year or two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And some people like, well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, damn, shouldn't you be working </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like getting a proper
career and whatnot? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, what is a proper career anymore? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like people are still like
50 years old driving Uber's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is that a career? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like why people gotta make
everything about a career? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who cares? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just your
prerogative, right of like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whatever makes you happy, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you're getting the money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's making you happy,
you're not hurting anybody, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's a proper career. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah there's way I see
it, as well as it, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if for some reason YouTube falls through, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a year and I got nothing left, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like, Hey man, I've got experiences </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people could like kill for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> All three of us have been smart enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to kind of establish ourselves
in fields outside of YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My plan B used to be go back to the BBC </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and go back into engineering lifestyle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But now like if YouTube falls through, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I have other plan Bs
of like other businesses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could possibly get involved in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's like, it's gave
me, it's given me like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a career that really
shouldn't have the feeling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of any kind of job security, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do feel secure that yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do have a specific skill set that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> working in doing this has given me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as opposed to five years
ago when I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the fuck can you learn doing YouTube? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, what the fuck can I
actually learn doing YouTube? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know how to edit a video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like you know, when you look back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and you start doing
YouTube and you just think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what can I possibly put on my CV? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm getting the thing out of this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What can I possibly put on my CV, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then now you're like,
if in terms of social media </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and entertainment and
marketing, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a big list. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think, you know, a
lot of people think is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of most YouTubers as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like they're fucking dumb people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Some college dropouts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, you do you see a
lot of them who are like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> fuck, I'm in the same category as him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, I think what
people don't understand is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they're a lot of companies that wish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they had people who
understood those kind of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because a lot of companies you'll see them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they don't fucking
understand social media at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If we did lose our job
there was a good chance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that we could probably work in a company </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be a head of that
social media department </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or help with strategizing like,
consulting anything, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Absolutely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it's like Dr. Disrespect, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was an online creditor, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then he went to work for,
I think, Activision, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Or Infinti World </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was the head of
their community relations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, for a while. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Before coming back to streaming? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so before he came
back, that's what he left. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause he was a big cold stream I believe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he left to go and be their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> community management or something on- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Social media management. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I believe it was something
along those lines. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he came back, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it speaks to even back then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that someone who had just
been doing videos online </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who seems very amateurish, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that knowledge that you
gain is so invaluable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and companies wish they understood that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they could hire as many
teams as they want but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because it's so rare
especially for someone like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Dr. Disrespect to like
reach numbers like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not something that you can like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not something that it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well, I got a degree and then I studied it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> therefore I'm going to
get results like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It just doesn't happen, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You learn a lot through YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think even if you
are doing it as a hobby now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you don't see any potential in it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the skills that you're learning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are really, really useful skills, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think you realize it useful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, one thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one important skill that
I had to learn how to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is kind of realizing what
skills I thought were useless </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and were actually not useless </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's actually
thinking back to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh yeah, I do know how to do this thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe this is actually useful in some way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's like, part of
making yourself look sellable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> as a person, to any employees. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What skills have you gotten, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more like experience do you have, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like we grew up in like a generation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or at least like, especially
with Asian parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where we were taught,
Hey, do well in task, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get like your degree, go to university </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and if you don't go to university,
you're a fucking dropout. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're scam, you're not my child. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then like the older I
grew up the more I realized, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, if you have like
certain career options </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and certain like career paths
that you want to go down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yes, a degree is definitely,
you definitely need that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if you kind of don't
know what you wanna do yet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that doesn't mean that every
other skill set you gain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is invaluable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Right, right.
- You don't need a degree </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to make a plan B in your life, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, I never learned anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about like business or marketing in school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like, I didn't take any of those classes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never did any of that shit in uni. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I learned so much
about that kind of shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just from doing YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's like a really
valuable skill to have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I didn't need to go to school for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just had to fucking- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Go through it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I just have to go
through it and experience it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because of the way I see it, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have an engineering degree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you put me in an
engineering workplace, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't know fucking shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know what's going on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe, I understand the rough concepts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that make up a lot of basic engineering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you could probably
teach me a lot easier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you couldn't just plop me in an office </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and be like, do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- I would have no clue at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because you have to
learn how that company- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You haven't utilized that skill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And without using it practically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, what am I doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I've just got good at tests. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I was shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I constantly got frustrated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I never felt like
I was learning engineering. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was learning the concept, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I felt like a lot of it was
so impractical, but I mean- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You were learning it through your head, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but not through your body, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, we weren't using it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like we learn, it's like,
why this is important </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they tell you, but it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't fucking like, (mumbles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you guys ever had like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> proper real job interview
or anything like that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was rough.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, yeah, I've had that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was yours for like McDonald's? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no for like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like a real job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So like, when I, before I
decided to do YouTube full time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was actually still
applying for engineering jobs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I was going to
do a year in placement. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Right.
- Which is in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if they do this in Australia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You could basically, after
your second year in the UK- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, you have an industry, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's an industry, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Basically working. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you get paid to work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you normally, it's normally those kids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who do really well in third year as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they come into
it with a lot more like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like an internship. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like practical experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Kind of like an internship. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> An internship that actually pays well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And you normally get a job after it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like they're normally- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Normally they, you get the job offer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for that placement after your year ends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And some of them might
even offer to pay for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the third year and the masters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kind of like no downside of doing it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially in engineering. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right, right.
- It's really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The hardest part is getting
an offer in the first place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's really hard to get
a good place to take you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember I did tests for
like rolls Royce and stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they were hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like they would make
every single one of them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was so annoying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You would apply for it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and they'd make you do this in
an hour and a half long test. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was hard as shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And eventually you just got to
the point where you were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I've done four of these in
one day and it took all day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I know I'm not going
to get any of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's be honest, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not smart enough to work
in Rolls Royce's jet engine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just gonna be honest
dude that aint me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I had an interview for one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just remembered
them asking me questions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, fuck, I can't
even like stomach the lies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't even, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even have the- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You get in the business now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I care so little about
actually getting this job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that I couldn't even sit
there and lie to the guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I would in a normal job interview. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I would be like, of course I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I never really like worked any job </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like before YouTube became a job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean like I told the story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of how I tried for McDonald's and failed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then, I did one
internship, like during uni </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but at that point, like YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was kind of becoming more of a priority </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that I knew I probably wasn't going to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into this field anyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like I'm not gonna
say the company name </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like last like two years or so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been approached by this
like relatively big company </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like international that
like really wanted me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that was the first time where I went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into like an actual, like
proper job interview. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I didn't do one interview, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did 17 interviews. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Holy shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not to mention, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I did some here in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I also did some in LA. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 17? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Fucking hell.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did some in LA so like, when I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like staying at Archie's place in Vegas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they like flew me out to LA </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just to do like six more interviews. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Oh my God! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Then I had to fly back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and at the end of the
day, I didn't get the job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd like to think that
after the 16th interview </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they were like, I don't think so, but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's try one more time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it was like a different
person every time as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So like, but this is
like a pretty big company. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I'm pretty sure I'm
not allowed to say who, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like it was a pretty big company. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was like, it was a company as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's like, Oh, like
if YouTube falls through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is a perfect place to work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, hell yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like this is my plan B. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I was genuinely excited to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe I might get this job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think that just made
it so much more stressful- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember, oh sorry go through. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it was like, because
I was genuinely interested </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's like, how do I
like tell that to the person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without sounding like
an absolute kiss ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You actually do want to work there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, yes, I
love everything you do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of course I want to work for your company. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So if you had got that
would you have quit YouTube? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hard to say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can't say now that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the place you're at in YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember every person in
their YouTube careers thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe I'll get a proper
job because I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know when this will fall through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was at that point where I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll give myself maybe another year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a lot of anxiety and a lot of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what's the word? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you don't trust it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You think it's temporary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even though, you know, it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's always that gut feeling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then I think I can
understand sometimes why, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some people YouTubers want to move on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and wanna to do something else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I understand that I don't
have that interest right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I don't want to move on
because I'm really enjoying it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But, you know, I'm starting to understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after doing this for like five years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can understand the mindset
of why someone wouldn't want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be in that coin flip every day is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well, let's see if I've got a job today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is kinda like, it is really stressful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think that I've
just become used to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But if you put someone in
this situation overnight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like it's one of
those things where it's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, they wouldn't be able to handle it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe not handle it,
but it would definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it would definitely wear on you I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Going back to job interview
so I do you have like a story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of like my very first I'd
say real job interview </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you know, I've had job interviews </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like Co-op and like call centers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - They don't count.
- They don't really count. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We were talking like big- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They just want to make sure
you're not a fucking criminal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All you have to do is
just be a competent person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and somehow Joey can be phrase of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> McDonald's interview, but
that's a different story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like we're talking actual
like big boy companies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, you're here for
a specific skill set. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So this is like before
I got my job at the BBC </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so as you do as a graduate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you apply to about 10
million different companies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just hope one of them sticks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So one, one company that
actually call me back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for an interview was a missile company. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I would basically be kind of like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, (imitating missiles) missiles? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, like (imitating missiles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What other missiles are there Joey? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know it's just
sounded really weird, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a company that
makes missiles, like what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that the sound missiles make? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (imitating missiles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So yeah, what would you do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I design (imitating missiles). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Get down to the missiles are coming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But yeah it was a proper missile company </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was applying to be
like a systems engineer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like design and make missiles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like obviously, I go in the interview </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm fucking nailing
this interview, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember how it is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the interview was split up into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two different segments. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like there was the one
where like they interview </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your like personality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, I can't
remember what that's called </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know there's a technical term. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's one where there like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they grill you about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> why do you think you'd
be a fit in these company </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you say, you're a fucking team player, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you are a perfectionist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you want from me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna (speaking simultaneously) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What are one of my weaknesses? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, well, you know, I just I'm- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just love money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am a perfectionist
and you can't fucking say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look, I just need money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I need to pay off
my fucking student loan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why are you asking me questions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you know the fucking answer to, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So well, like I, I
breezed through that and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know I'm doing a good fucking job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I get to the
technical interview, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the technical interview, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I actually prepared for this, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because you know, I'm
working for a fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm applying to be a
fucking missile designer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I should probably know the basics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of how a missile works, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And sure enough, I get to
the technical interview </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they ask me can you
explain the broad basics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about how a missile works, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Then you go (imitates missiles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs)
- I go (imitates missiles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, so I'm sure I've mentioned this before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but my degree is in electronic
and electrical engineering. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was, so basically, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this was gonna be brief, I
know how a missile works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I've done my research- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's done the studying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so, I start, so
there's two interviewers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's one older, serious guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there's one like
younger, not exactly a graduate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but he's been there for years, but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like at the time he was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> late twenties early thirties. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The more understanding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I start explaining
how this missile works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So there's like a whiteboard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like, so I draw the missile, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, I'm like explaining, explaining </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> explaining everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, yada yada, here,
this system does this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this system does this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so my final year degree
project, my thesis, sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Was on like object, real
time, object tracking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, perfect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Perfect for what I need to explain here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I start explaining how this missile </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like tracks different objects. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I draw this rectangle
and I label that target. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I draw a dotted line </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from the target to like this
missile that I've drawn, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I started explaining, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is how the tracking system works </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the tracking system is
in the front of this missile. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I code an off the
front of this missile, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm fucking getting into this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, okay, so this is, this is how, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is how my experience
of my tracking degree </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can like help with how I
can, like how a missile - </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like your selling yourself, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I'm fucking selling myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm getting into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I look over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then like the oldest
serious guy was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Hmm, yeah, it's very in sweat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the younger guy was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to hold his laughter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no, what did you
draw on the rocket gun? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I look over, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm thinking to myself, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why you laughing at what I'm doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm killing this, why are you laughing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm fucking killing this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my career is on the line here,
I just want to get a job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What could you possibly be laughing at? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I look at what I drawn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I've drawn a penis. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How did you draw a penis? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've drawn a big girthy
penis pissing on a rectangle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughter continues) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did you do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've actually got a picture, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I've got to show you this picture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was really hoping this story's climax </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would be about a penis. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was figuring what he was saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> he was drawing on a board
something else was coming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God Garnt! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God!
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like, I didn't realize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how much it looked like
a fucking penis until- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a straight up
Johnny scenes girth, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is a fucking girthy penis. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a veiny motherfucker. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then as soon as I saw that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as soon as I saw that, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I knew I failed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not because I was doing a bad job, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know when you're in the zone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like, there's nothing that
could take me out of the zone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knowing that I've just
drawn a fucking penis </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in front of two examinees. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then after that I just start stumbling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I forget everything I prepared. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You failed that test? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah I- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you didn't get it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't get it.
- Fuck dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They specifically said, and that I did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> super super well on my, like
the personality side of things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But the technical side was lacking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Until you draw a phallic
object on the whiteboard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had totally blocked out of my mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that there was a, they ask
you technical questions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I think I was
so fucking bad at it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I remember I had a
question and they were asking me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how turbines worked and
I knew how they worked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you know, when you are in a room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like two really old men </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who've been doing this for years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they ask it like, they're
like, how do you shit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Tell me how you shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Describe how you shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, I know how to shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but when they're looking at me like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they asking me that way,
I'm like, ah, ah, ah, so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, the blades ah take the oxygen in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they mix it with, am I right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is this is right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember I just butchered it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But also did you video
interviews, but you did, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there was no one to talk to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Video interviews. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or like on Skype and shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So if you pass the test, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The math test and the personality, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They would say that you
wouldn't get an interview. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You got a video video interview where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all you could see is yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no, I never had that
but that sounds horrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never had that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That must've have been as
like three times, three times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so basically what it was
is, there would be a... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It fucking felt like a Mario fucking party </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quick type of thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It would be, there would be a slide right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where you could see yourself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it would cut to your question </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it would be like five, four, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you have to answer
it and they were filming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh my God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was terrifying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like one of them was like, so stupid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like, you know, it's going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like, you know, like, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who's your biggest
engineering inspiration? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - My engineering idol. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, I just did
this for the degree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think about this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just trying to play
code like what do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fuck! Fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I shout like Einstein or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughter continues) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm not kidding, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I said Einstein, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I finished that question, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the next fucking thing is
two of seven questions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The next thing I just
fucking all left four. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like I haven't got this,
I'm fucking all left four. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Einstein. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The most famous engineer in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You might have heard of him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there's no way I'm getting
it with an answer like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's like asking what
your favorite meal? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> White bread. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love white bread. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Potatoes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like I literally altered
for the next question. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I'm not getting this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm closing this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Who fucking needs the
rest of the questions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you guys ever had
like group interviews? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember I had one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like, so this was
like at the second company </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that I applied to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we had like a team
building interview, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds horrible already. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah and so our first task </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was we were grouped up with another person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I will never forget this person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though he's a fucking genius </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'll get to that later. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like so our... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So there were work, there
were going to look it out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like our team building so
the very first task, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Was very simple so we
get paired with someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we had to like learn
as much information </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about them as we can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like names, hobbies, yada, yada, yada </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then we'd have to like present that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to the group, right.
- Oh fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As like, I'm sure they saw it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as an icebreaker and
everything, but you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the worst way to ice break. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Testing out like communication
skills and listening skills </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and all the basic fucking team
work and stuff we wanna do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I get paired up with Dan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Thank you Dan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So like we get paired up and
immediately he just goes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Hey, my name is Dan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so here's how you wanna do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, I'll say whatever
I want to say about you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you just say, it's right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you say whatever
you want to say about me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'll just say it's right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So we don't have to worry about
this stupid icebreaker shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I'm just like genius, genius. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Giga brain.
- Giga brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like, gets to our turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he starts talking and he's, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he gets my name, right but
he just fucking makes up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything else about me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - An absolute Chad move. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like to play FIFA. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's so smart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My favorite, like my
favorite film is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't even remember what
he fucking said back then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - South of Western balls or some shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and so then it gets to my turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, Hey this is Dan- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He loves FIFA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, like a, yeah, he's

<SPEAKER_01> No, I don't like playing call of duty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow, top 10 anime betrayal- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was just like, you motherfucker </SPEAKER_01>
