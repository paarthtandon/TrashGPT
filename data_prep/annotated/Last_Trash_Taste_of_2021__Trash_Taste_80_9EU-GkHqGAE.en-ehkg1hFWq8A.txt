<SPEAKER_01> (cheerful music)
- You have one week left </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to get your Apari/Trash Taste merch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey yelling)
- [Connor] That's right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Only one week left to
grab it. Grab it now! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It has beautiful embroideries on it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the After Dark design </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the regular Trash Taste design, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well as T-shirts and sweat pants. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Show it off Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look at this, look
at this, Look at this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what, this is the first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> light mode is gonna look this good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's embroidery we
wanted it to last this time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The merch is a little bit
more pricey than before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it will last. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it will be around for a long time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the quality is insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We've promoted Apari many times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and every time their merch sells out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we know you love their quality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And of course for
every person who does buy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any of the Trash Taste items, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'll get a special </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> personalized postcard from
the boys. Just for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you have one week
left to get your merch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I gotta be honest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you ever approach us
wearing this Trash Taste merch, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you'll get a firm crisp hug
and a handshake from me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A chef's kiss as
well. (Joey smacks lips) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe a kiss on the lips,
who knows, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> ♪ It's the final countdown ♪ </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey mimicking final countdown) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We can't get out on (Connor mumbling). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No copyright claim, no copyright claim. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So if you'd like to grab your hands </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the Trash Taste merch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because after next week
it's gonna be gone forever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Go down, links in the description below. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Grab some for yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Back to The episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (sound of water splashing)
- I need to hydrate man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Here's some water please? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh dear my throat is awfully parched. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt sipping) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckles)
- Is it quenched now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (gentle music) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you know where I learned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the words "Parched" and "Quenched?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor burps)
- [Garnt] Where? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (chuckles) Nintendogs, really. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] What? they use that language? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (chuckles) Because in Nintendogs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when it says that you need
to give your dog water, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it says "Parched." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then when you give the dog water, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it says "Quenched." (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I learned the word "Parched" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in from the film "Inside
Man" or "Inside Job." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't remember which one it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's "Inside Man." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause there's an interrogation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's an interrogation scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the guy's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Can you give me some water
please? My throat is parched." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the guy was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Bro, no one says their throat is parched. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs)
"Shut the fuck up! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Shut the fuck up and
tell me what's going on?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hello and welcome to another
episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs)
- Such a weird way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to remember a word. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] I don't know (chuckles). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How vivid of a memory is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, where'd you guys
learn new words from? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because Like sometimes...
- I just told you Nintendogs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes you just hear a word </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that like that sticks with you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Video games I learned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> all my language form.
- Video games? Movies? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nowadays I pronounce
something incorrectly on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on a fuckin video or livestream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I got 10,000 comments and emails </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> telling me I pronounced it wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, but it's a pretty
good way of learning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought English was your
first language bro. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes hello this is Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is I, the biggest Miku fan apparently. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey giggling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't simp Garnt or I did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you look like you're
about to on Idol concert </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah so we're recording
two episodes today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we have to like change clothes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess I just gave that away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there was nothing else in the office, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aside from Miku stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Today I am the biggest Miku fan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And with me is of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the second biggest Miku fan right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (mumbles) Don't call me out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This was Saddle merch bro,
TM saddle. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't even know that was Miku merch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah it's Miku merch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> If I turned around, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people would be able to see, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very clearly this is Miku. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a big fat Miku on the back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We don't need to see that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's business in the front. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Front and the back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then there's just Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the usual, whatever.
- Yay! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The actual Miku fan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah and Merry Christmas everyone! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess...
- [Joey] Yay! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess this is coming out on Christmas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's also the last episode of the year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Supposedly.
- [Connor] Yeah. Damn! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because the next episode is gonna be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> coming out on 1st of January. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We didn't even plan that shit out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I guess that's just
how the stars aligned. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When did the last
episode come out of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did it come out on New Year's Eve </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or did it come out on New Year's Day? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think It came out... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah like New Year's Eve I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I remember I was
just getting drunk with Chris </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and that was like the first
episode of the year right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so I think it must've been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> after New Year's Day then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That doesn't feel like a year ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] (laughs) It doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It feels like 10 years ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - My God, like where did this year go? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it feels like the past two years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have just like flown by. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean 2020 just disappeared
in a flash obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because everyone was just
inside and depressed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But, like this year I feel we were able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go out a little bit
more, at least in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're able to go out a little
bit more than last year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But I think in our case we
just had so much shit going on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it all just like, seems like a blur. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean was, I thought
I was busy in 2020. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then 2021 was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Allow me to introduce myself." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then, yeah... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every, like on the iPhone calendar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like when you have something
on the iPhone calendar, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you have something on that day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like a little dot to symbolize it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, it's very easy on iPhone to see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how busy your past couple of months were. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because every month I
came up to the next month </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, I'll be a
lot more free next month. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like this month was super busy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Next month though, no dots. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Enter that month, all dots. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey chuckling)
- Yeah, no time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like oh cool I have
three days off last month. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No wonder I'm fuckin tired. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was really surreal seeing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just your calendar fill up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I remember when
I first moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought, who needs a calendar? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're YouTubers, we don't need calendars. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We make our own schedule. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You move to Japan and
slowly, you're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe I need a calendar to just to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> keep track of like one or two days. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then more stuff keeps creeping in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you're just like, oh wait! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to put my personal
life for my calendar as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like, now I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when like my mates wanna hang out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I have something going on that day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so surreal just being this busy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I never expected to
be this busy in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean it's definitely
a good thing right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's a very... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's definitely a very
privileged position I would say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To be busy and doing
all sorts of cool stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But at the same time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's only so much my body
can handle (Joey chuckles). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know that scene in like,
every like business movie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where the CEO is like,
"Put it in my calendar." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought that was just a cliche. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Deborah, pencil it in." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Oh, do I have time for this meeting? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Put it in my calendar."
- It's only a matter of time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> until we all have our own Deborah's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that have to pencil shit in for us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think, I'd ironically
want an assistant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Group laughs)
- Yeah right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know that sounds terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I felt like what the fuck
I would never want one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then I'm like, oh actually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then a lot of things could be helped. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But if I had someone to
help schedule things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I know a couple
of like YouTuber friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> who live here that have
like personal assistants. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like oh my god that
seems like a fuckin lifesaver. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh man the thought of having </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to like speak to someone. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And be like, "Hey my life's a mess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Can you help me?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, it's not about that like, I feel... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how to explain it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm embarrassed about having
to get my life in order. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? That's what it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, it's like going to the doctor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want you to tell
me that I'm shit at health. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I know that. But
if I go to the doctor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna have 100%
confirmation that I'm unhealthy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just don't wanna
be that guy who's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Talk to my PA." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Talk to my assistant."
(Joey gags) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let me say like, if you wanna like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> get permission for stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or get like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like okay I need to be able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like arrange all the shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can you help you do that I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, I mean some days like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know about three,
four days of the week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I pretty much fill my schedule up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> from literally like eight
o'clock till like midnight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah insightful.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Good stuff doing stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I like that, I liked doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And livestreaming just
added a bunch of time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it needs to be squished in there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean you've put more
work on yourself this year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I feel like this year is the year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you've really upped </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your livestreaming schedule as like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you basically have almost
like three channels now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You got Trash Taste, you got... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Your main channel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you got...
- I do have three channels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your livestream channel right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah well, 'cause
now I'll do livestreams </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the morning or the evening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, if I'm not doing
something in the morning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's say if I have
something at 12 o'clock. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like we record Trash Taste... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Today we did to at it at 11. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if we did it at 12, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would be like, all right sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll wake up at eight, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll livestream until 12, I'll come here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I'll like work all day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I'll go do
something in the evening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I'll sleep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> This is why I can't watch shows actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is what I've realized. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I literally have no time.
- Yeah same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know what Joey's excuse is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like streaming until I sleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I realized I have no time to watch TV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I literally have to pencil in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing)
the times I watch Anime now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Because 'cause here's like the... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like the ultimatum of
every Anime YouTuber right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause a lot of the times, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it takes more work to make
a video about an Anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> than to watch an Anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I actually have to pencil in okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the time I'm going to put in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into making a video about Anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And here's the time that I have
to pencil in to watch Anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like the time I pencil in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to watch Anime is like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The time I pencil in to
make videos is like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey and Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is like the equivalent like doctors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having to like study new practices </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to stay on top of their game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I have to watch Anime, it's R&D </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just love to think
that like, if I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if someone was like a mate
of Garnt's so he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey Garnt, do you wanna like
hang out on X day at X time." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And Garnt's just being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Sorry man that's Anime time." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - literally there've been
times where Sydney's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh Garnt can we hang out on this night?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Sorry Sydney,
it's my Anime watching hour. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "And it's part of my job.
I need to keep up with like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "What's airing right now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - My friends laugh at me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I have to like ask them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to like, I send them
emails, like invitations, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to like times, to like hang out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, "Let's hang
out, I'll send you an email. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "To like put it in your calendar." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I'll forget. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You send them like a
Google calendar notification. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think about like the last 10 times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I agreed to hang out with
someone at least on like a call, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> not like in-person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never liked not turned up in person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But my on-call to hang out with people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like I don't get to see often </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or people who live in other countries. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think like the last five out of 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that I didn't put in my calendar, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I like turned up
late or just forgot about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, if I don't put in... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel terrible about that,
I'm a bad friend but yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - If I don't put it in my calendar, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because sometimes you get like free time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or you think you get free time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do I actually have free time?
- You think you have free time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you say, you whip out
the calendar and you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh I do have free time." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then an hour passes and you
get message and you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, weren't you meant to be... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "We're meant to be having a call. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "We're meant to be hanging
out." And you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh fuck! It's a lie! It's a lie!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - For me It's like, for
me the problem is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going back to like the
apple calendar thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like all right, finally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I wake up and I'm like finally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A day where the dot is non-existent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs)
I have a day off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can do whatever the fuck I want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then I go to my computer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I look at my other schedule </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's sitting at my desk and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, I have to edit three
videos and do two sponsors. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, so it's not a day off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a day to be inside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I'm not necessarily
doing anything outside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So, it's not a day off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And yeah, that's been my
life for the past two years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you guys have to-do lists? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've been starting to
like do to-do lists now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because I have to forget
what I have to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To-do list, the day I
discovered to-do lists, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like to do it late. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt giggling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like a Caveman turning over a rock. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah game-changer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "There was a list of
things I had to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "It changed my mind." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't even think cavemen were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that impressed when they
discovered fire like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause like one of my friends... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do you get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing)
these easy tips? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly dude like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when it comes to like Al stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we have so many
things that we have to do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so many things that
we want to do right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, my dad actually taught me like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how to make the perfect to-do list, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is you wake up in the morning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you think to yourself all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you jot down everything
that you can think of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can do, and that you have to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You jot it down and then from that list, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything that is super
important goes to the top. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Else that can wait a couple
of days goes to the bottom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you go on with your day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you tick off everything that you do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're left with a couple
of things, that's all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That becomes the top of your
to-do list the next day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And just, I've been doing
that for the past year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I've become infinitely productive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I guarantee you that's what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mudan does as well probably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> With the amount of shit he has to do like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, "How do I find
more hours in the day Mudan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You seem to like pull from
this infinite pool of hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "That I don't know where you find." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't want it, mere
mortals aren't meant to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> have that level of productivity... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I (chuckles) threw away
my humanity long ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We don't wanna wield
that level of productivity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just wanna know what
did Mudan sacrifice? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what? (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think he like cooked... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What did it cost? Everything! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think he hooked his
like brain in car (mumbles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like brain and heart with car battery. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs)
It's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> constantly just going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't wait for him to
come on and explain himself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - "So just don't sleep." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's awful at like
explaining how he's productive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like he doesn't make it
sound realistic at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "I just wake up in the
morning and just do it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's the epitome of just get good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like with Mudan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I only see like the input and output. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like input, editing work. Output, a video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't see like what happens. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's basically just
like a black box right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like the YouTube
algorithm, because like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you kinda know how it works, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but no one really knows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the inner workings of
the YouTube algorithm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's just like Mudan
and editing for me man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you ever seen Mudan edit? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The only time I've seen
him edit, is on stream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's where he's also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> doing something else while he's editing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's probably like holding
back on streams as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> as people don't get freaked out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Certainly using 2% Of the brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sorry. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, that's how impressive
it is because it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think, people already
know who watched the show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> are aware of just how much
he edits for Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And also for me and Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think people forget that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> other people also ask him to edit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's editing for Sydney now as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, I'm just glad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And not to mention he
edits his own streams </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he streams. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And he also streams as well! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And he also streams
like pretty regularly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm Like, what? How? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Man's a beast! Man's a beast! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would like to know what... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Mudan what is your secret? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When he comes.
- When you come on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when he come on,
- He can tell us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Please, please... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The long awaited episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're also waiting for
the country to open back up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> which hopefully will finally
happen next year as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like in part what I'm saying ish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the biggest thing I'm hoping for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean it's gonna happen next year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just when, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is it gonna happen early or
late, that's the big question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think everyone is saying like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as early as maybe Feb
or March right I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - March would be nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Visitors can come in,
because right now I think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're a non-visitor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so if you're like a student, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you're on work visa or stuff like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can technically come in now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not that I've seen any actual examples </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of people coming in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I assume they need to get... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't looked into the process, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but I assume they need to
reapply for some kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> application because not tourists, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but at least if you have a working visa, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or you've been waiting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like a job or to study here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> then you can come here which is good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it shouldn't have taken two
years to get to this point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel bad for the students man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I know right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just being like finally I get to live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> my dream of coming to Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No it makes me feel so bad
because like when we applied, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we had to wait like what, three months? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that was just like
the worst three months by. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's not the fact
that it's three months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the fact that it's three
months where you don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's gonna happen to your life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're just like your
life's kind of in limbo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until you get that confirmation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be like, "Oh, okay,
finally, I can start packing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I can start preparing to go." And then... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But while you're waiting,
you're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Uh should I start? Should I go? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What's kind of going on with
me in my life right now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was wondering with
the students things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was thinking like okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we had no way of knowing that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was gonna take two
years for Japan to open. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, I don't know what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I actually haven't really
spoken to any students about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, what was like,
if you got to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like day one right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You find out Japan is closing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, do you just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> wait and see, or do you just
decide to do something else? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then like hope, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and hope that you can just then go back? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know?
- I think for most students, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think anyone was anticipating them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to fuckin stay in limbo
for two years right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I'm sure the majority
of students were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, I still got time, I can wait." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh fuck imagine losing
two years of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess, progress you could
have made in your 20s. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then again, it's
not really that important </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I guess a lot of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in life didn't start doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their main thing until they were like 40s. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I guess it really
doesn't fuckin matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, yeah, true, true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean but, I think what sucks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that you just have two years where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't really commit to something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what really sucks for me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I always want to have a goal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that I'm working towards </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and know that I'm actively
working towards that goal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause one of my biggest
pet peeves is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I'm feeling like I'm not
working towards something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then I just feel lost. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I just feel like a fuckin lost soul. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I need something
concrete to work towards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why like I really empathize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with anyone waiting for a visa. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And thank God you guys
can finally come here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hopefully we get here soon,
get to eat some tsukemen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs)
- That's the number one thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck the sushi.
- Don't get tsukemen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck the ramen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> go to your local tsukemen joint
and discover true happiness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then we've the Michelin Star ramen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah we do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it was very... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We didn't know it was Michelin Star right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was a place Maylin recommended to us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it ramen? Because
I thought it was soba. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] No, it's ramen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like Chuka-soba,
which is like Chinese soba, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like, technically
ramen, some people call it ramen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The noodles are more ramen noodle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was very light for a ramen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was very light yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause like when you said
like ramen, I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, it's going to be a heavy ramen," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause ramen is the kind of meal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like takes you out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It knocks you out for like an hour </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because of how heavy it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the thin
noodle ramen I guess... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was very nice, it was good, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was light.
- It was good but... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I was thinking about it, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> okay what do I... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I have the wrong
expectations of Michelin Star. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I expect some kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stupid luxurious-like gourmet thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but I guess it's more about value, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the food you get.
- It was like 1000 Yen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> At least the one I got was like 10 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean like $8 right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's amazing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I have a picture of it, I put up on... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was very good but the
whole time I was thinking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "I think
tsukemen is more tasty there" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think so as too.
- I think so as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The bulk standard tsukemen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which was better than
the Michelin Star ramen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I agree. Honestly, I didn't
enjoy the ramen that much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I got okay, 'cause
here's the thing right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like Michelin Star, if
you've been to enough of them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially in Japan, 'cause it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in Japan there's so many
Michelin Star restaurants, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I've realized that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with Michelin Star, you come in with like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the wrong expectations right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this is gonna make me sound, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is gonna make me sound
so fuckin privileged and all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Michelin Stars aren't
all that great but..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Where's the
Michelin Star Garnt? Tell them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a Michelin Star, but like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here's the thing right.
- The Tire Man? No! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Group laughs)
- Like here's the thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When you go into a
Michelin Star restaurant, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your expectations are like
up here, you're like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Scott knows all well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because he often frequents
the Michelin Star </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No but like, you come in
with these expectations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you're gonna get like a meal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a cut above the rest right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so you start judging things harsher </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than if you just go to
this random restaurant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just like find out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that there's like amazing food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause in Japan, I feel like there is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just as many restaurants that have food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that are like Michelin Star quality, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just haven't been discovered yet? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And, and to me like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Michelin Star isn't
always the indicator of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this is the best meal
that you can get in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it only means is that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's become famous enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that people have started to notice it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But there are so many hidden gems. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, for example, with
the Michelin Star ramen, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that is not like the best, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even the best ramen that I've had, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the best tsukemen that I've had. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've had like sketchy ass places </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that were a little bit
better. (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I honestly think the insect ramen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I had from my video was actually better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that had 150 crickets in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not shitting on this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We haven't named the ramen place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I also don't
wanna like fuckin make... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm saying that because the insect ramen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was actually fuckin amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. And also like,
because it's Michelin Star, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it actually made it a worse
experience for me right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you wait in line... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because your expectations
are too high right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - One, yeah expectations is high. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And two, it's really,
really fuckin busy right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So, in this ramen shop,
it's a tiny ass ramen shop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, when we say
Michelin Star, it's a really... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a normal ramen shop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ramen stores in general are like not... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would say they're
good dining experiences. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you wanna come here and
chill out with your friends, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't go to a ramen place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a come in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> eat, and go.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean that place only seats like what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 10, 12 people maybe? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's busy, it's like narrow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, if you're
even remotely large, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then larger than normal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're gonna have a tough
time squeezing past everyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like not fine.
- [Garnt] Unlike, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We went at about 2:00 pm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So not even like, not
even close to peak time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we still had to wait
like a good 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like a good 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And this is when the country
is closed to tourists, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so when tourists come back in... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was talking to some people
who've waited for this ramen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like an hour, an hour
and a half, two hours right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you get shepherd in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you're expected </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to just eat the ramen and leave right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no downtime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You get given a bowl, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you eat it and then leave. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't like, to me, part
of like the food experience, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just like, not feeling
pressured to eat the food, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but just...
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But just like, feeling like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can take my time to enjoy this food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I couldn't even like bask. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like as good as the ramen was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I couldn't bask in it because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was the pressure of all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I could take my time with this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'd also be pissing
off the 20 other people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still waiting in line right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Exactly right, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Standing outside. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is why I've realized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that ramen is best at like midnight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can just like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They take their time with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They always serve beers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone's having like
a good time in there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's a way more fun atmosphere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like some of the stores
that are open 24 hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> normally have a few more seats as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is the ultimate
midnight snack for sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly it's awful for your stomach. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's a good chance you
might like bring it back up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But some of the best
ramen experiences I've had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> are like midnight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're in like a sketchy area </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of some place in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone's drinking beers in the store, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's cool atmosphere, everyone's talking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so much more fun
than ramen during the day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where everyone's just
there to eat and get out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the best ramen experience I had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was when I was absolutely shit faced, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at like 2:00 am. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then my friend Makoto was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey speaking Japanese) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at like 2:00 am and I was like, uh okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, we ran around the corner </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to this like awful sketchy place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the ramen wasn't even
that good bu just like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When the moment I went
down, I was like damn! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Good to feel alive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But then the moment you
walk out it's like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh it's awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause you've ruined your stomach </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with all the alcohol.
- Be right back in the diner. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause to me like the
restaurant experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> goes beyond just the
taste of the food right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's like a reason
why your mom's cooking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> always tastes fuckin good right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's 'cause like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause that cooking mean
something to you (stutters). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Where's the heart man?
Where's the heart in the ramen?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs)
- Honestly, honestly! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you can taste in some Japanese restaurants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they put the heart to the cooking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like it's so obvious with
some like very small shops. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean I just think that I just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I realized that I don't like ramen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> as much as I want to like ramen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I Uber Eats tsukemen on sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that shit is fuckin good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because also ramen travels terribly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why I never, ever order ramen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean unless you have like one of those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really old style ones, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where they like, bring you actual bowl </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with everything in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the only one I get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Problem is nowadays with
ramen, with Uber Eats. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They separate the noodles and the broth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So they just give you a broth
in like a plastic thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really?
- A lot of the time yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They don't actually put the noodles in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You have to put the noodles in yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah it's not good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the noodles are supposed to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like piping hot in the broth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, it doesn't really work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But tsukemen, it travels
pretty okay, 'cause you... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's because the broth is
so thick, it's like magma. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It stays hot forever.
- The Broth is so thick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It stays really hot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the noodles are
supposed to be separate anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you just dunk the noodles in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's almost as good as you get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Definitely better than shop at but yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like if you need that itch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, I've been saying man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been advocating for. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because like ramen is
that one Japanese dish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where before I moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was thinking oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna eat ramen every
fuckin week, every day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I realize I've had ramen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> three times in the past week. (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But I didn't have ramen for
like months before that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I was saying like the last time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had ramen before we went to this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Michelin Star ramen place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like I think... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - A year before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A year before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's just because I have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> zero craving for ramen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause why would I have ramen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I can have tsukemen right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like but the one dish that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I haven't got bored off though is sushi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I eat sushi at least once a week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - At least once a week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs)
- You eat it more than me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I love sushi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd probably go maybe like
two or three times a month. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wish there was like a really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> quick and easy one near my house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I would probably go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't wanna order it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah no, it doesn't order well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, I feel like there's a few </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> conveyor belts sushis near my place, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's just perfect for lunch man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's quick, it's easy.
- They're like 100 Yen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause even like the 100 Yen sushi, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like 80 cents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like one piece of
like salmon or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, honestly like my experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with sushi in Japan is that, I've also... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Maylin has taken me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to some Michelin Star sushi places as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But of course she has. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maylin only eats if there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs)
Michelin man inside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> She's like, "I don't see
the Michelin man anywhere, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm not going in." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically part of the big reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why we've gone to more
Michelin Star places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is because Maylin suggested </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these places to us.
- Maylin swears by it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, which is how we
found the ramen place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is Maylin
recommended the ramen place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it happens to be Michelin Star. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I have tried like, a few like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of different sushi places </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like different price points. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And my honest opinion is that like sushi, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you reach about like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you reached about like
$30 a meal for a sushi, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is about, mid range
sushi in Japan right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not cheap, it's not expensive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's about as good as it gets to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you can get sushi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from like $30, like $100, like $200. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gourmet, super famous
chefs out there like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor whispers)
"How dare you cunt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "How dare you?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unlike, my honest opinion is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've had the expensive sushi, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, it's better, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's not that much better
than like the $30 sushi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I can get. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's how it's always is there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I find the meals there
are a little more pricey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> than the normal ones, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are generally like the nice ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then when you get to the stupid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> extravagant levels of prices, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like not that worth it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a 10-fold increase </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like a five to 10% better meal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I would argue that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're ever gonna go to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially like the high,
high-end sushi places, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which is all around Tokyo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then like get something
that you could only get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in that high-end restaurant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like, 'cause I remember
I took my friend Luke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like the really high-end sushi place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause he's never been to
like a high-end sushi place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I took him to the one in Harajuku. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like 400 bucks
between the two of us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's like really high-end.
- Just some rice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a bit of fish, oh lord!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that place has like, I think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if you guys have been to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like it's the one where you can have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the nine different
types of sea urchin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's nine different
types of sea urchin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So they do this like special thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't even want one type, fuck! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So there's a special thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they do like nine
different types of sea urchin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why are talking about sushi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we haven't had lunch yet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckles)
- And you get like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My stomach's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt makes rumbling sounds) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you can like taste test. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like the different types
of sea urchin from like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different parts of Japan and
around the world and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like that is like cool because... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] I'm literally salivating. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll give you $0. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like that is cool because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I've only ever seen that in that store. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like yeah it's expensive, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that is an experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can only get in that store, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't go to like a fuckin
sushi chain for a sea urchin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like if you can just kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to a high-end sushi place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just order fuckin salmon on the ice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so then like, there's no point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no difference, like you're not... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The average person is not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that much of a sushi snob
where they gonna be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh this isn't the high-grade salmon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "that they're using uh boo!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like, even if
it's high-grade salmon, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like 5% increase on how
better the taste is right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And sushi is basically just,
it's rice, it's the fish, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the wasabi, and it's just like the... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Soy sauce they put on top, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like it's basically,
you just have to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make sure the ratios is all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then there's only like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so much the fish can be fresh right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - At which point do we just like say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey, you just can't make
this taste any better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "with the ingredients you're
given," right, because... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Unless you have like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 10 times the number of taste
buds than the average human, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's not gonna change yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like my tongue doesn't... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I'm not part of like
Shokugeki or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't taste the exact percentage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of salinity in the fuckin bitch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Although I must say when I did try </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the nine different types
of like sea urchins, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was ready to take my shirt off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from how good it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just like, Ah! (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just an unagi fan man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's my favorite food in Japan,
unagi. It's the best man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah but see like even like unagi right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like after a certain
price range it's like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can't taste the difference. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like that's why like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you could just go to an unagi place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of expensive unagi in general, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but I mean even like the
lower-lower price point ones, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm always like satisfied, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm always very happy.
- Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I think it's somewhat
good for you, so that's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not terrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not terrible for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's got a lot of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of good omegas, those fishy oils. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But they are also going extinct as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the reason why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> their prices are getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> higher and higher.
- Well, is it like Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like 80% of the
world eels or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Something like that yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then there's tons of
eels from other countries. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like most of Japan's eels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that is like nearly eaten to extinction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're like almost all gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why they're just getting
more and more expensive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw like a whole Business
Insider video on that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause Japan has a thing about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "We don't wanna import foreign things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "It's lower quality." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well they're starting
like eel farms now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they import the eels
as babies from other countries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then grow them in Japan like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're Like, "The Japanese eels." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, "It's just
like Japanese eels." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Half of eels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is why... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is why I realized, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you go to a restaurant
and they serve you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this like really expensive dish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or really expensive meats right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That doesn't necessarily
mean it tastes any better, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because a lot of it's like, a
lot of more expensive meats, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weren't that expensive in history right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, the taste hasn't changed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like for example lobsters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They used to be like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Peasant food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah they used to be
like peasant food or... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Caviar? Peasant food, peasant food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't say peasant food without </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> someone laughing in the office. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tide pods used to be
peasant food, now gourmet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Crew] Salmon used to
be peasant food as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and how the hell would I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is salmon like peasant food? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Group laughs)
- At sushi restaurants it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Most of the time right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> These fuckin restaurants, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the ones that are like the super high-end, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you feel so fuckin out of place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you're not like
an oligarch from Russia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't feel like I belong there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna go to the place
that has a cool vibe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah the food's a little more pricey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than going into like
Yoshinoya or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a little bit more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You get a vibe, you have a chill time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no expectations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't have to worry about
how you've been dressed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the vibe I like,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a nice time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just wanna have my $12 burger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like, "It's
better than McDonald's," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's got a little gourmet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's not gourmet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they put avocado on it or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just that middle price point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is my comfort zone and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> " This is nice." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just wanna feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the cooks and the chef
care about their food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's a big thing for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, when I order a
drink and they ask me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it tastes okay before
they serve it to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's when I feel like
I'm out of my depth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "I've never done this
before, I ordered the thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "you give me the thing." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Is that Michelin Star
water fitted for your needs?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I order a wine,
just give me the wine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Even if I told you it doesn't taste good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you should just be, you
should just laugh at me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and be like, "Well, that's
you did bad so laugh." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the small things. If
I get served food and like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they come to an ask like, "Oh, how was it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Was it good?" I'm just
like, "You know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You care enough to like
care about my opinion." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I meant as in like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they're gonna take it back if I say no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not like, "Am I enjoying it?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's the kind of restaurants that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when they bring out the dish or whatever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you'll look at it and
you're like, "What is this?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then a light novel title </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of explanation starts right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, "Can I just eat it?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like two bites. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would be done by the time
you finished explaining this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs)
and I wouldn't care otherwise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Those are the ones where
I'm like, if I said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if they came up to me and they
were like, "Was it any good?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And if I hypothetically said no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> then they would be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What can we do to help you sir?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like what the
experience I remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was during the cycling special </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where we went to that
restaurant with that grandma </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who was basically just like eyeballing us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as we were eating the food.
- She pretty much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> pulled up a chair and sat with us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like aunt feeding,
you know what I'm saying? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah (laughs), yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was so fed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I loved that place though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just 'cause like when someone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I get it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause like when you
cook a meal for someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they enjoy the food, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they think it tastes good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like there's such, like
such a rush to that right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like I've seen enough chefs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who, obviously it is a job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I understand, some people
just do it for a job, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's just a magic
to a chef or a cook </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who cooks the food, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and just get such an enjoyment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from seeing people enjoy their food right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, it doesn't just... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This isn't just chefs but you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I just see someone enjoying their job, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that just makes my day better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Even if you just go to a fuckin McDonald's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you see like that one
person with a genuine smile </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You know what, good for you man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You're having a good time
working in McDonald's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm fuckin happy." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know man, if it
wasn't McDonald's, I'd be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, someone's getting blackmailed." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause you ordered a Mac smile Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs)
- Can I get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a smile for that one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which for some reason
on Uber Eats in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the bottom of the page </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you just order all the stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was a Mac smile option for zero Yen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> how you would purchase sad Mac smile? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I'm not there to see the smile. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that natural? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Genuinely go to Uber Eats. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because in Japan if you... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My day's ruined, it is a lie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Japan if you go into
a McDonald's restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you say, "Can I get a smile, please?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Then they'll give it to you. They have to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I was fine with that right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't agree with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> should have to smile upon being requested. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But, why the fuck on Uber
Eats is it listed when... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is the Uber delivery
guy gonna smile for you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. 'Cause
I don't even see him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they have, they
fuckin drop it off my door. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's fuckin like take like an InstaMax. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And just slide it under the door. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fuckin Uber driver </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just takes a picture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of the McDonald's employee just smiling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't understand why Uber
added this to the menu? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like for what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't understand how this is gonna work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I added it one time and nothing happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's legally part
of the McDonald's menu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because obviously
nothing is gonna happen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I ordered the Mac
Smile via Uber Eats. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because what would happen? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just curious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is this a Japan exclusive thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Japan exclusive.
- Of course it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It would never work in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Employees would quit on the spot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They'd be like, "I'd
rather die than smile." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Crew Member] I mean it's
the same with McDonald's here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, yeah you wanna
smile, "Please order it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There you go.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's like an actual
menu item in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - These poor workers are being
forced to smile upon request. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - At least give them
like a tip or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can't tip.
- You can't tip though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can't tip here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So what's the reason for smiling? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, it's because the
customer ordered me to smile." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Smile, enjoy your job." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want someone to encourage me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as I ordered these 30 nuggets, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that will inevitably destroy my body. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What I enjoy seeing someone smile </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without me having to order them to smile. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs)
You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But in Japan you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't know if they're doing it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they have to do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Japan is the
master of business smiles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end of the day.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like I've been
to enough places... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in Japan
- Some places I know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, this is like the corporate
smile I'm watching now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because there's no way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you turn up like half
drunk to a McDonald's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they are happy to see you there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that stumbly ordering of a cheeseburger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like there's no way anyone
is happy about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey mimics a drunk person)
- "Excuse me, Can I get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "a smile with that please?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor mimics a drunk person)
- Ah! Big Mac, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor speaking Japanese) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I see maids in Akihabara and guys, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think they're really happy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs)
to talk to the customers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe they're just not excited </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to talk to the people that they seem like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they want to talk to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you watch someone smile, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but their eyes aren't smiling? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all the maids in Akihabara. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs)
They sound so cheaper. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they have a big smile on their face </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as they're waving to you like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But deep in their eyes
is just, "I wanna die." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, the industry's also dying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So, you can't be too happy about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean there's like significant amount </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> less of maid stores or cafes but then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But now they all have masks on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So they're probably not even
smiling under the mask either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughs)
- A God sign. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How can you tell if they're smiling now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They've perfected the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I sound happy without smiling voice." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laughs)
(Connor sings in Japanese) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Just like that behind the uniform. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey sings in Japanese) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (crew sings in japanese) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Good they shouldn't have to smile. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm all for people not needing to smile. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's all right, I wasn't gonna go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into those maid cafes anyways. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs)
So don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really Joey, really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've been to one, it fuckin sucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've been to one as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We've established many
times on this podcast, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that they are the worst thing on earth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They are the worst.
Have you been on one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I don't need to go to one to know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs)
I don't want to get to one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm violently uncomfortable by it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's an experience, you
should try it at least once. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] It's so uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the most
un-British thing on earth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I can't do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've seen like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so like Offline TV went to one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, I can just only imagine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> how awkward this was when they went there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this is terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would go back solely for the reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to take Chris with me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That would be an amazing video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Taking Chris to a maid cafe." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a lot of things I would do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just to make Chris suffer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs)
And to make myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> suffer as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can I take you and Chris to a maid cafe? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs)
- Sure, you should. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We'll see how you guys react to that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sure, why not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Trash Taste maid
cafe special," That's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But promise Chris's
reaction's often off camera </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> are almost funnier than his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on camera reactions.
- Yeah they are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause, he'll just be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Shit! That was shit! Connor
why do you made me do that?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Seem Chris and you're like
the love-love beam or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what they say...
- Oh my God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are they Mohicun cun? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh the Mohicun cun.
- Oh my God! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna see Chris do that dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Chris has gone to the point where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> he's just the most entertaining,
miserable British man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like he's so funny to watch be miserable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> ause he's perfected the art of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't feel bad for making him angry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughs).
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like some people when they
get upset or uncomfortable, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like you feel sorry for them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But Chris has perfected the way of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you just don't feel bad for
laughing at Chris when he's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's the only man that can somehow laugh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> while having a frown </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on his face.
- Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But what's so good about being British. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> The people don't feel
bad for laughing at you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause people they're
just like, they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh! he's having a horrible time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs)
"It's funny, it's great." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like to me with maid cafes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like to me it's the perfect
determiner to see if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> someone's like a lost soul when
it comes to differentiating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> between like Anime and real life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause if you go to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if he goes to like a maid cafe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you don't feel uncomfortable, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then to me that makes me feel like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ripperoni. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ripperoni, he's a lost soul right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because maids are meant to act
like Anime characters right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's nothing
more uncomfortable to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than seeing like a real
life Anime character, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like right in front of my eyes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well because in real life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like extremely uncomfortable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to see somebody talk that way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "Please just act normal..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause people do not that way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Please just act normal," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What did you say, I'm begging you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Please I don't know,
slap me or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I don't know anything but this." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just talk to me like a human being, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> please, please.
- [Joey] Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We all say that, but
I think to our audience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, "I can name
off about 50 things." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We have moved studios. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We've got a merch with... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is probably the
biggest achievement. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is probably the biggest thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's difficult 'cause you don't... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Often you don't wanna spend too much time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> patting yourself on the back, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because if you do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you often get lost in that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You become, be considered yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You wanna keep pushing forward </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and never be complacent
with what you've done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I guess I'm happy I moved house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It didn't really feel like
something that I've achieved, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but I felt like it was a big dub. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Get moving to a better place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know that's all right man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes, you have to stroke
your own dick sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to feel good.
- I know I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the only way... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Definitely a minus is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the gym has been less apparent in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I need to get back soon.
- It has been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> non existent in my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just happy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor can I say where we used to live? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We can say the area
- We can say Saitama. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, I'm glad we've moved out of Saitama. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt chuckles)
- Yeah we did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, all that time when we said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we lived in Tokyo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that was a fuckin lie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, we lived in Saitama at the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not exactly, it's the greater
Tokyo Metropolitan area. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is zone six really London? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Saitama is massive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Saitama is a fuckin massive location. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like three times the size of Tokyo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We lived in like the area that was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> connected to Tokyo.
- Close to Tokyo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it wasn't difficult. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Going into Tokyo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was like different trains </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that we could get to go into Tokyo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, we could like either
take like the rapid train, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which takes like 20 minutes or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get into central Tokyo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like the rapid train is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> only comes once an hour.
- It was a Unicorn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Now there's a commuter rapid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, the commuter rapid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's two, there's the
local rapid, commuter rapid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The local stops every spot obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> The rapid stops like, I'd say half. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - People in Japan are definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna figure that out, where we are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe, Oh really think so? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah because the commuter
rapid is like one train line. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really, there is a few stops </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it goes to that we could live at. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think people in Japan now figured out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, it's definitely that line," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they were wining about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Good thing we don't live there anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah good thing we don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs)
live there anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So there you go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (crew murmuring) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs)
There's only one train line. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's only Saikyō Line that's still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (background noise drowns out other sounds) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just gonna say it because
there's only one line. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey, Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, they wouldn't know the exact stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. That's fine, that's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay there's two
lines in Saitama though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can get, the
Keiō Tokyo and the Saikyo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Keiō Tokyo sucks, stops every stop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It takes like 10 hours to get anywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's like two lines. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One of them actually gets you places. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> The other one, it literally
takes like two hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to go from like the... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's because Keiō Tokyo
like from start to finish, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> goes through full prefectures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah it's crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah it's nuts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then like where we used to live, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if we could plan
going into Tokyo right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause you can plan to go this time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get the commuter rapid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a fast train. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But my God! Going back
it was such a pain right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Seibu-Shinjuku at like
11 was like nightmare. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause you'll never
get the commuter rapid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You will never get like the
rapid. It's always the local. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then suddenly a 20 minute
commute turns into an hour, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the local train. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like the first
few times I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, I okay, I can do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then afterwards, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially when we started
coming to the office, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where we moved office. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted to move a lot closer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The first year didn't bother me much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't really care much that it got to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah I'm glad we moved. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I liked where we lived actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was a nice area. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, it was a really nice area. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just too far. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I won't lie, the Uber
Eats selection was shocking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs)
You pretty much, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you had one option for every cuisine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was like, if the Thai place was bad, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which luckily it wasn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Thai place there
was like the banger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, the Thai place
was like the best place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like the... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> All right Chris current Thai right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's like, "If it's not
Michelin, I ain't having it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> good Italian food that
delivered, which was like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like there was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the most
privileged fuckin thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't care, I love
Italian food and I love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> getting that pasta.
- "I don't know if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "heard of Domino's?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's pretty Italian, if
you know what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They do pizza? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They do pizza, and pasta. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was one place, but it
was ridiculously expensive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - For me the biggest
thing that was missing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Uber Eats selection was healthy options. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah there was like,
no like salad or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like if you wanted healthy foods, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you needed to cook it yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And a lot of the times, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of the times I wanted
to eat healthy and then like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I would get back from work, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then the day would be over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is the most first
world problems we have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - "God forbid I chop bubble
lettuce in my own home?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We be like the Uber Eats
selection was rather poor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is like pre-oligarch,
like levels of water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I used to just go out a lot to eat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just because when I did
move into my previous place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I saw the Uber Eats options. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like, are you? Fuck
that! I'm just gonna go out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you're busy enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But also you were a lot closer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the places than I was so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I guess so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But It was like nothing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> near me news.
- It was nice though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like that area was super
nice to walk around in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, I do miss the area. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like, I feel like I only started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to really walk around and explore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was deciding whether
I should move or not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs)
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, there's a lot of cool places, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot cool cafes and restaurants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I just didn't notice before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'd never bothered
exploring the area </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they didn't show up in Uber Eats. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So how could I discover them? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And yeah, like I feel
like there's a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> small local places that I miss now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I'm also happy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be in a more convenient area </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and being outside that time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just happy, we've all moved into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> much, much bigger and nicer places now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like as good as our
previous places were, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think, especially
after we got this office, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was definitely
time for an upgrade </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in our personal lives as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean I've said this before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was happy with my place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was very lucky to find the place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I have moved into. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I was still pretty
happy with my place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, to me it's definitely
an upgrade, but it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a natural progression to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel like there are some things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I've definitely
progressed in, in like 2021. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then there's some
things that I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've probably regressed
in, or stayed the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. It's been
a sort of weird year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause after 2020, everyone
was just like all right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> ready to like hit the
ground running in 2021. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the environment
just didn't allow us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like hit the ground running. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Group] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like, I remember like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think for a lot of 2021, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I can say this now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because I think before
going back to England, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was definitely burnt out.
- I was the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm say the same, like
I was definitely burnt out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everyone's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, why didn't you take a holiday? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Why didn't you take some time off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "to just look after your mental
health and all that stuff." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And what I will say was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was nothing that I could do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was nothing that I wanted to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause what I wanted to do was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see family, see friends,
back home, see people... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Two years is a long time man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Two years is a very long time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that was like my reset right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, before that, like I
was definitely burnt out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I kind of just dealt with it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by just trying to fill up my schedule. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And kinda kind of just like ignoring it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I didn't fully realize that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until I went back to England, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just had nothing on my schedule. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I just realized, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> holy shit! This is really refreshing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm getting a lot of ideas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I wanna go back to work now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not doing a single thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is this what it's like to have a break. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Have a proper break? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is what it's like to have a life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> To just not do anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. So, I mean, that's kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what has been hardest in 2021. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause 2020 was like, was a year where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the entire world was flagged. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 2021 was like, me waiting for the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to get back to normal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's finally looking like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it is going to get back to normal now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fingers crossed, touch wood. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you boys happy with your
YouTube channel this year? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Group chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which one Joey, which one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Both, both. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love it 'cause 2021 is the year that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Joey finally became an AniTuber. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Not on the Anime Man channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just (laughs) not on
the Anime Man channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I have, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I told Garnt about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but 'cause I've been uploading </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot more on my second channel now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'll be making a
lot more Anime content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on my second channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now that I have a playlist
on my second channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> called Actual Anime Content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Just to poke fun, but like yeah I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm very harsh on myself when it comes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to my YouTube channel and my
content and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So like, I'm obviously proud </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of all the videos I
upload, on both channels. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Otherwise I wouldn't upload it at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But I'm definitely... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm fuckin not proud of all of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughs)
- All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, I'm definitely
one of those people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like, after a week, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of that like honeymoon period, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> could have done better on that video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll do better on the next one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I try and do it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I keep thinking I'm
going in the right direction. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Then I'm just like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> At the end of it I look back at all of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, yeah like, 5% of it was okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The 95% could have used a bit of work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think, like I have
like plans for next year, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for what I wanna do with my shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, I dunno, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's gonna be scary because
it's gonna be a lot different, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like pretty much everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've established up until this point so... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> See how it goes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I guess that's why we
have Trash Taste for right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like as a fail safe almost or a... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not so much a fail safe, but like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I guess like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] A safety net. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like a safety net I guess, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because when we started again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like when we started
Trash Taste, we were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh yeah, this will be
like a nice side project </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "for us to do." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like we could do
all sorts of cool things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the sideline while we
focus on our main content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But now it's like well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're like 1.1 million </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> subs or something.
- That's crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Insane on the main channel.
- Fuckin insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thank you again by the way guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now it's like pretty much
become like the main basket now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And our main channels,
and our side channels, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and whatever else that we
do outside of Trash Taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has become the safety net almost. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know Trash Taste has become </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like almost the number one priority. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It is the number one priority. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] It is the number one priority. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When we need to schedule a recording, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's getting done before
any of my fuckin videos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or any of my scripts in man.
- Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. So it's like, definitely, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause like we do have like lots of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exciting plans for Trash
Taste obviously next year, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which obviously can't tell you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but look forward to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I definitely plan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my working week around Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Not the other way round. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey & Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I think just like that right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like that mentality is
already just telling off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, this is our main stick now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But also when I think because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> all three of us are involved, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess we probably pay more respect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the scheduling of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's all right well.
- Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I fuck over my own channel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's my own problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But if I fuck over the
scheduling with Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a burden to everyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we have people who turn up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to help us with Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I fuck around doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a Monkey Tier List on my own channel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if I don't do that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's on me and that's it right?
No else is still looking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that that's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess like going back to the whole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like getting a personal assistant, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like getting a team, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to help behind the scenes of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my main channel and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's the one
thing I'm scared of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like, I'm gonna
feel more pressure now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to deliver on my main channel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because now it's not just
me that I'm taking care of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's I'm taking care of
a personal assistant, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like an editor, or a
manager, or whoever right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's like multiple people's
livelihoods at stake right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's really the only thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess that's stopped me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> from personally getting
a personal assistant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - #No one's taught them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe they'll realize
that I'm fuckin stupid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They be like why am I helping you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It is a lost 'cause. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, like for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the biggest change
for me this year is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess I've been really
trying to figure out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not what I want to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but how I want to do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like you said this
last year and the year before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor and Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that okay if we just say... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did I say this last year? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You definitely said this last year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because I think
this year has been the year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where I've really like knuckled down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to try to really start
thinking of my main channel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> as like content, as a job that
I have to like break down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like actually be strict </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on how long it takes to
like make a video because... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're right, you can't
taking months to make one video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I mean like, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I think one big
thing that has changed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since joining Trash Taste right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that for better or worse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My content upload schedule </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as compared to you're guys right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And especially like seeing how
you're guys' content is made. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like not saying like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously I'm not saying like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anyone's content is better or worse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've kind of realized that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to upload as much as you guys, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but with the workflow of my solid content, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've tried to like cut as
many, many corners as I can. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there is like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There is just too many bottlenecks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that I can't do to like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I've reached max productivity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I can reach with my channel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And before last year I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I can improve, I can do better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I can do like three videos
a month, and Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And now I've come to realize that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not only is that setting the
wrong expectations for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to feel like I can do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel bad if I don't do it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it also like sets
the wrong expectations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the viewer as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause if the viewer is
expecting me to upload </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that many videos a month </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I kind of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I kind of keep doing that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then that's just gonna be unsustainable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just gonna burn out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which I did do this
year, but that's like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't burn out because
I was putting myself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> through too much work, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I burnt out because of
the world situation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I've just realized
that, I need to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I need to make a schedule,
which is sustainable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And unfortunately, it's
for better or worse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, my upload schedule does
get compared to your guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's like, I've come to realize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to not feel guilty about that anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, when I make jokes about
it. I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think it is... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just a little bit of fun, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I also don't like,
I've never considered, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think me or Joey
have ever thought that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> your channel, or your content and channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is comparable to ours in any way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I don't think one upload
is equal to one upload on... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no and not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, definitely not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess it's like forced
me to like really break down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a workflow to like the video right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like, how long would it take... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How long does it take you
guys like make one video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like hour wise, would you say? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That varies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah that varies correct. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It can be literally like two hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or like a hundred. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's some videos that like,
even one now that's really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like a really big
video I've been working on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I've been wanting to
do for a very long time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A lot of moving pieces, and a lot of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of, a lot of, a lot of edits, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and a lot of footage to go through. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But that, no matter, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even if I put like a
month's worth of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's say if you just took
the hours I put into it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> let's say it's like just
a full working month </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of hours into one video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't fuckin matter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I gotta upload
the week after anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it so unlike it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then maybe the week after </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> will be something that took me two hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, it's kind of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you kind of have to juggle it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but also not make it look
like all these videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> are like completely different quality. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is why I kind of just realized. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, the only way I can make my videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not seem drastically like different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in feeling, theme, quality, production, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is to just have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess, me being an
idiot, and my personality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> being like the focal point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or at least a main aspect of the video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. So like I had
to break down for like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's say like the fastest video... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I had to breakdown for this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, I had to break down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor and Joey laughing)
my video making process. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the fastest video you can make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like say in like
two, three hours right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's say you like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you needed to get a video out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I felt like a few times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I just need to
get a video out right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the time on my
end, not including editing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like I need to like
pencil in and let's say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm doing a video about an Anime right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I have to pencil in hours, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a round about a day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to watch the Anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> assuming it's like a
season of Anime right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then let's say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> two days for scripting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like one day
for the actual script. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One day it's like finish the script </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and actually make it like a good script. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And, and so that's
already three days right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I have to have like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> two hours or so, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> two hours for like the
recording of the script. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I send that off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's like, on my end,
three and a half days already, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be sent off to the editor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Now the editor edits it and
he has to send it back to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I have to do like
the finishing touches, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uploads, and finishing touches, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> upload, thumbnail, and title, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which if I'm really lucky
would take half a day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's like four days basically, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of workflow from beginning to end. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's if I'm fully productive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and nothing goes wrong right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the fastest I can make a video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All of you assume that
I don't procrastinate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs)
- Now so that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> four days in a week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Trash Taste is one day in a week right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I also want weekends as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh now you're just wishful thinking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You are at that point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are weak Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Beggars can't be choosers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've realized like in my previous years, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I've been able to
do three videos a month, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been able to do three
videos a month and Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because I've just worked on weekends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've just realized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I kind of want weekends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I kind of also wanna do
other things like stream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like maybe focus on
some side projects as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've just realized, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm trying to put too much on myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the type of video I'm making, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if there's no way I can
make this video faster </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than the way I'm making it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and people will say well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Why don't you become like a
personality based channel?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you guys where you can
do different kinds of content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is more focused on any personality. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've played around with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I've just realized, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no I kind of like enjoy what I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like scripting I've... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've already got Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have a channel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is based around my
personality so called. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughs)
And so, I've just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've just realized that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my main channel is always
going to be a max cap, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two uploads a month. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I'm lucky three uploads a month. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm not going to feel
guilty if I don't make that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If it's one upload a month </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm traveling or
because I'm on holiday, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what you're getting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, I guess this is a
message to you guys as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> which is I know the imagery is just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, Garnt is a lazy bum </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey & Connor laughing)
who doesn't upload that much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But trust me, I am
working at full capacity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you guys are getting
two uploads a month, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe one upload a month,
if I'm busy that month. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But, that is me at max capacity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm not going to try to pretend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that anything else is that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I honestly never saw a problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, as much as I like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> poking fun of it or whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in episodes and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I honestly never saw a problem
with your upload schedule. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because again like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know how much work goes into the content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you make specifically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you say you take two
days to make a script. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I sometimes take like
a week to make a script </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm nowhere near </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as good as making a script as you are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The two-day script
happened this year. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Before it would take like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe like three days or four days before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't script. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I feel the more scripting you do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the better you get at it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you understand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the basics of how to
get a script down right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I remember the first script </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wrote took me fuckin forever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how do you write jokes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never written a joke down in my life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and performed it off of a script right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, it's like yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I would see like your upload schedule </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I would see your videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I would think to myself, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right if I were to make this video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how long would it take for me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I think to myself, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, it'd probably take even longer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than it probably took Garnt right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's why I've never really seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a problem with your upload schedule. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If anything I think like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm honestly even thinking
like for next year, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm thinking to maybe go to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something similar to your
upload schedule as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I wanna put, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I think this year, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the thing that's changed
with my channel is that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've definitely upped my
quality of content or like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've upped the bar of
the minimum standard that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a video should be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And that has resulted in videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not only taking longer to
make and to edit for Mudan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but also it's taken longer
to prepare just in general. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's like right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially these last couple of months </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that I've been in like a
little bit of a burnout. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've noticed that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one week or a week is
starting to get tough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I actually forgot I had
to upload the other day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was so busy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean especially with us two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Legitimately I just
forgot to upload the video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the day... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like midnight and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, I could upload it right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it was supposed
to go up in three hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But I had to wake up at
4:00 am to do a call. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like fuck this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I need like these three
hours of sleep I'm getting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right so, but it's like,
especially with us two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> now that we've like put more effort </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into our second channels as well right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And on top of Trash Taste every week, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then Trash Taste After
Dark every week right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, that's already so
much shit on my plate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I realize like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, if I continue this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> once a week schedule </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or if I kind of lock myself
into this once a week schedule. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm either gonna completely burn out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm either just gonna
be so fuckin exhausted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I can't do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or, worst case scenario both. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the quality of my videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is just naturally gonna go down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've been toying with the idea of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just not uploading all January. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Doing the classic YouTuber move. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, I kind of wanna like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just do streaming all month. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So, and I thought
January is the best month </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because that's when you get like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] zero Ad revenue. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You get zero Ad revenue. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's the YouTuber
month that everyone takes off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause they aren't getting much money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughs)
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I do actually wanna try doing
like streams full month, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> see how it goes and then, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have more of a consistent
schedule with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I feel like I've
invested a lot in the streaming, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm still like in compared </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to other people who have
full-time streamers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm nowhere near as consistent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think that's one thing that's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is a detriment to that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause people always complain like Connor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I never know when the
fuck you're gonna stream." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Yeah, I know." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But that's what I like about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Group chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like that I just turn up
and I'm like, all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm just gonna stream
for 12 hours now casually, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "let's do it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I think like Trash Taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has definitely done a good job </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like, to varying
levels, or varying results, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like Trash kind of like gotten us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to kind of look at our main channel stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and being like, "I could probably change." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it actually a main channel? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it like... (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just say main channel for
the purpose of main channel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really didn't think
about like the only... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's weird now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Old channel.
- It's weird now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't even think of any
channel as the main channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, I just make shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Some of it has priority
over the other ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it depends week by week,
which one I might prioritize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because like, part of the reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why I've been putting down the... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been putting the
same amount of videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the main channel now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is two videos a month </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm not gonna try to do
more because I want to... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You do two videos a month? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought you did one a month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I only do one a
month when it's a holiday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Connor mumbling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So yeah yes, so right now
I'm doing two videos a month. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm putting all my extra time into, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do also wanna like
make a second channel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause that seems fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's super fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I see you guys doing it and
I'm just like, you know what, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe my main channel doesn't
need to be my top priority. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've got like the formula
down for my main channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now I just wanna... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I just want this extra
time to do other shit now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I was thinking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I have like a lot of
ideas for like big projects </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that can go to my main channel right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I am sitting on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But my God, they're going
to take so much fuckin time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like doing these big projects </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really takes a lot out of you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially when you're also trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to maintain your consequences </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and upload a schedule on
your main channel anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, I've kind of come to realize that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I really, really feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm down on YouTube and
I need to work on a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm really passionate in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then I'm gonna start doing those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But for now, like I wanna
do more small, small stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna do more small,
small stuffs with you guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think the thing for me was I was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I'm not sitting here saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that my main channel is
quality by any means. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think there is some level
of effort that goes into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I mean I'm to harsh on myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Would that not be quality? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's quality.
- There's a certain bar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is quality. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a certain bar that I try to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on the channel for most videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There are some times
like, I did like a fuckin, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which Chris loves to joke about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My monkey TLS video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which I just wanted to do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I thought it was fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's obviously, it's not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's nothing like
exceptional, but in general, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the videos that I have
were quite difficult, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but, sometimes I see someone doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a you laugh, you lose challenge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "That's seems fun." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd like to do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll do it live instead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll do it on the other
channel 'cause it works. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so, it kinda came to a point where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of fun ideas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that just weren't big enough, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or weren't exciting enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like warrant putting a lot
of time and effort into them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just kinda work really
well on the other channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's something I wanted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I've noticed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> One. That's why I want a second channel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I feel like I have set </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a bar of quality on my main channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I've liked tested
uploading videos that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe have not had as
much time put into them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you do see it in the
view numbers, eventually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, that's why I'm just like okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's just keep my main channel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like the contents. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Big boy videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's for the big boy videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For the videos that my
audience expect of me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But that doesn't mean you can't do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other things on the second channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. It's like,
there's like so many like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially timely things or, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like so many things that perhaps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have nothing to do with the
shit I'm known for right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That I wanna talk about in the video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, when YouTube brought out their news </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they were gonna get rid
of the dislike button right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I wanna talk
about this in a video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but I can't just put up
a 15 minute Rant of me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the main channel talking about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, so it's like perfect. (claps) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I have a perfect outlet
for random shit like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you get the comments of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't watch Trash Taste
anymore, I watch Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean that's fine and everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the end of the day it's still me right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, it's whatever, it's weird right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause especially this past
like two or three weeks, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been uploading a lot
more on the second channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I found myself waking up
and thinking to myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right what should the next video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the second channel be? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah not the channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, I haven't mentioned, fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I should probably think
about that one as well right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think because another
big thing as well is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like, right now
with my main channel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've definitely seen the plateau </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of just that kind of Anime content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like that kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Anime content.
- [Joey] Same, same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you know, I do
have like ideas about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> how, I could keep that channel growing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and grow past the plateau. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the amount of time and
effort that would take, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me that would take
too much time and effort </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I just don't have right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> They'll take giving up
Trash Taste basically, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to make content and rebrand my channel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to a point where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it can grow plus past the plateau </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of that kind of energy content right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How do you feel about the growth </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on your channel, your main ain channel? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, I mean I'm fine with it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I know like right
now AniTube as it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> has just plateaus, like that's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we've seen a platton. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If there are any other AniTubers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who would like to prove me
wrong, please, because... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm waiting for that one
person to prove me wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm waiting as well because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I need a kick up my ass and be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, you can go higher okay?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like my motivation 'cause like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure you guys are the same way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't matter how many
subscribers you have right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> What I find happiness
in is growing something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or like making it feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have made progress on something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, like I felt way more fulfilled </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seeing the progress and
growth on Trash Taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than I did on my own
channel, for like last year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like that's why the
thought of a second channel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> excites me way more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than even making big
videos on my own channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because even if I make a big video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my own channel, which
I'm really passionate in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know that there's a certain cap </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like the number of
views that's gonna get. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I mean it's already like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially with like all
of our main channels, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's already at a size </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where we're pretty happy with right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, it's massive
to a lot of people right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's like, it just
makes more sense that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously you're gonna
have more excitement, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watering this tiny plant than
watering a giant tree right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Obviously watching this tiny thing grow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into something bigger is
going to be more fulfilling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Especially if you're
trying to do something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you're otherwise
not really known for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Perhaps it's like content that
you've never tried before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think that's why I've been having </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so much fun with the second channel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like, yeah I dunno like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my main channel grew as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I hit 3 million subs
this year, as to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So did I. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Group laughs)
- Yeah you do as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Go ways and where that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It doesn't feel like a probably a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah right, but like
to me it's like I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I know definitely
past me would look at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> some months of my channel's
growth and being like, oh man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't really grow that much at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I've just rewired my
brain this year to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if it ain't a negative,
then it's all good dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, if every day I'm
gaining at least one sub, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm completely okay with
that now because it's like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I haven't been counseled yet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, if people are still like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looking at my shit and
wanting to come in, cool dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My doors are open, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like I'm not at this
point now where I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh fuck, I only made
20,000 subs this month. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm slowly dying. It's like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, the channel? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah I'm like don't trynna say oh no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just past that point now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I'm much rather put in
the time to like, be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, I have this tiny second channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That I'll wanna grow into something big. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, let's focus on that kind of thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, with like Trash Taste for instance. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like that's way more exciting for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think that's why, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> at least you and I have had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of fun doing the second stuff right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah man, it's just like streaming man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just something new right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did they just start like
properly streaming this year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Or did they start last
year? I can't remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It almost feels like you've
been streaming forever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like properly, properly
like consistently, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was this year right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's been more this year
than it was last year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Well last year, since 2009, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When was the chess
tournament? The first one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Early 2020. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah 2020. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay well, 2020 was around
when I started streaming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah this year is probably
when it's growing the most. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been a lot more consistent, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> been doing a bunch of stuff with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, it's interesting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I still, occasionally I have people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coming into the Twitch being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had no idea you had a Twitch channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, yeah. I have
that every time I started. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I guess it's a
different platform right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah it is a different platform. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Is there any changes you guys want to make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going into the next year? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Or just continuing what you're doing now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess just like, I dunno, for me... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - New Year's resolutions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTuber New Year's resolutions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - (Joey mimics a lame voice)
I'm gonna hit a million subs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on the second channel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's probably gonna be a point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause when the world is opened up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I do wanna travel a lot more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I actually like have a
bit more of time to relax. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So they'll probably be
appointment uploading </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a little bit less. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not really too
bothered about it at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just gonna say it now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just expect less uploads on
the main channel I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just because for one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I want to put more effort
into each video now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna like be confined to this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> once a week schedule and like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're gonna talk about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what Anime you're not gonna watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, probably not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I do it, that'll be
on the second channel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where actual Anime
content exists. Subscribe! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, I don't know like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at least with the main channel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I think, I know what kind of content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna like focus more on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on the main channel from next year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But that is definitely gonna force me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to not upload every week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Just because it's going to be impossible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think last year
my New Year's resolution </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was to be more productive
and to upload more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then as I've just said this year, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've kind of realized yeah that I tried. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I really did 'cause I
went like a good like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> four months where I had like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three videos a month, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like yeah.
- Did you really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I'm just like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was before he went to the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like pretty consistent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was so really, fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't watch Gigguk? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing)
- I do but I couldn't be sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was literally just
before the office move. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it took like...
- Oh really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuckin three weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the office move.
- Oh Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean it was around the same time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was like the first half of the year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I realized, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, my resolution
was just unsustainable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, I've accepted that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, my New Year's resolution is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna do more collabs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, it's not gonna be
on the main channel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which is why I wanna focus
more on another channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I've kinda realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> collabs just don't work for the dynamic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on my main channel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's there's...
- Why What'd you mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> come to my all collab. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All collab, remember that one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The one collab. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That legendary club? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That one that was skit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. That was a long time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was like three, four years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Come on you used me
out of the bustle a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean 'cause like I wanna do less, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something that's like not scripted, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'd feel like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> anything I scripted in collabs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Anything I do on my main
channel has to be scripted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that, that video
was obviously scripted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I also just want like more time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to work on like side projects. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanna do a week long
livestream at least at some point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll do it at some point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Good luck with alvra. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll do it at some
point. I did three days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just double them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's just (chuckles) double yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was double. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did that not like break you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Three days will like
easily break me off like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is three hours for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I made a mistake
of shouting during one game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Too much getting angry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it fucked my throat
for like the next day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then obviously it wasn't
having any time to heal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was talking all day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so that was a rocky mistake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I do it again, I'm
not gonna shout as much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs)
Not as angrily. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, actually the
sleeping in that shit bed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was kind of uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't really get good
sleep. That was one thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No yeah, I wouldn't either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wouldn't with a fuckin rave. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If I had thousands of people... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah with a fuckin rave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going on in the background as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The bed sucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd probably just do one night </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'd just go and
sleep in my nice bed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, "I'm rested
boys, let's get it. Let's go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Come on. Marscube streaming." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno. I wanna do that at some point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not a wonder. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah and I mean like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess like in the case with like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Trash Taste as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like because you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we're that the world is hopefully </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna open up a little more next year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're just gonna be really busy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with that shit as well.
- I mean like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the workload for Trash Taste
has been up as well right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause we don't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> now we stream every
week if you didn't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until at least until
Christmas comes along which... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Trish.tv/trashtastepodcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which would be around now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But once the New Year rolls along, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna continue the weekly streams. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I defer, I detour. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, what that means is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we're basically just recording
another podcast every week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We put each have two
Trash Taste's at this point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs)
You have the Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and the Trash Taste After Dark. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah you guys are getting like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five hours of content of which isn't most. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which if there wasn't
enough of my schedule already. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> There's, there's another thing
to tick off the main channel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's another Trash Taste recording. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think somebody added up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the runtime of Trash Taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was longer than like
all of DBC or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I believe that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You still rather watch that of DBC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The people are like, I've
re-watched episodes there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And all of them. Oh my God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Regarding Trash Taste though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We figured out earlier </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we've only uploaded
one special this year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. Which is the Cycling
Special back in Favorite, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which we filmed the year prior. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - When will "The Figure"
episode count as a special? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's kind of year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] It's like half a special. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like half a mini special yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] I guess it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a mini special.
- It's a special in nature. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And not a name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs)
'Cause we're still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the office. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I mean we had "The Cycling Special" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then we've had like
some mini specials, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like "The Figure special," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "The PC build special." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But I guess it truly is like top gear now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where we get like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [Garnt and Joey] once a year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - One big special a year, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and very other week is just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the normal episode.
- We should name </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> big two specials a year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's probably a healthy amount. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Two yeah, I think two is special amount. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah well a big portion
of this year was... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Remember when we first
started doing specials, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we were like, for a year, let's do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs)
All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That ain't happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, because we had like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we had just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> back then we had our main
channel with Trash Taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was it.
- Yeah that was it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now we have our main channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You guys are doing your
second channel, streaming, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Trash Taste After Dark. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then we gotta do to
our specials on top of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Easy, easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mudan, Mudan, teach us
how this is done Mudan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And people wonder why we want assistance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs)
- Yeah right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I really, I might genuinely
considering it for next year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's gotten to the
point where I actually will. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not a matter of if, I need one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or if I want one, I actually need one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Otherwise I think I'm gonna go insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I've been trying
to look for one as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But I want an assistant who is in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is very hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Otherwise I'd just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fuckin fly Eleanor over or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But yeah, I am also definitely
looking for an assistant. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> - Oh fuck, that's a fuckin question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just gonna drop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that bombshell.
- That came out of no where. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why, have you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Me neither. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you gonna have a rest? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm tryinna think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That question just came
up on the top of my head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I regret not going to the gym more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No regards, I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I regret not studying Kanji. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do realize that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As we found out on
the Trash Taste stream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the other day.
- It would be like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But no I actually regret </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not putting more time into Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because my Japanese studying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has been like very spotty this year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd be like super into it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like, something would happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like I would take a day off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then that would just
like stack onto like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two days and three days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then suddenly I'd find like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a month had been taken
off of learning Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then like the first few weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of me getting back into Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is just like me relearning the shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I already knew before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's kind of like the
gym in that day right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where in that way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you make your gains, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you stop going, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then when you go back to the gym, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you gotta like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> regain the gains you already had. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it just feels like
really demotivating. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (gentle upbeat music)
It's like trying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to push through. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor whispers)
- It sucks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I really wanna get to the gym more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I'm just lazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you just lazy, or is it just because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have got so much
going on in your life now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you just don't have the time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean if I really, really,
really wanna go to the gym, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could make time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's not something that I
enjoy as much as other stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I really do wanna go more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Or some days after I've like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after I've been, you
hurt for the next day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the day after that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like not great feeling 100%, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's the only time
that we can have time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm like oh shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck maybe I'll go, maybe I won't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's tough. It's tough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's really annoying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My schedule was a lot more unflexible now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I think I have times to go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just a lot difficult. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A lot more difficult to get it in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the way I wanted it to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah because I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Because you just have so much
more shit going on right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So like even if you are at
the gym, it's like, oh fuck! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're just thinking of all the stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that you could be doing otherwise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And it just feels better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I travel a lot more videos as well now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, that takes stuff away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It feels weird there was a point where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "The Seadog channel" was just
you inside filming videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now that Fifty video
that is not outside. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, I'm kinda
slacking back, kinda slacking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Group laughs)
- "Is that honey." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is what I'm worried about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm like fuck all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So let's say, I wanna get
back to the UK at some point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where the fuck I'm I
gonna do on my channel? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone's gonna be like,
"Why isn't he outside?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like so what is it I fuckin do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the UK outside?
- Just go to Weather Sprints. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs)
- fuckin off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd just try every pint
in Weather Sprints. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs)
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not a bad idea actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd watch that.
- I was afraid you'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> try every meal deal at Tesco. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, I'd do that too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've already tried them all, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'll prevent like I haven't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do it on video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't even know what I would do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I'd basically be like
shitty Tom Scott at that point, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "This is a house, where they
get water through a well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "It's really old and stuff." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's like the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We don't have anything interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We only have like really
old quirky stuff in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We don't have anything modern
that's like fuckin insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I guess that's why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to travel south side the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's got some interesting stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I generally really
don't know what I would do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with my main channel content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I ever moved back to the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't worry I don't have plans to... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt and Joey] It's not
happening any time soon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - These boys keep me
hostage, I'm joking. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what I would do, I mean I... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This cheque titled "Trash
Taste" keeps me hostage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's very enticing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the thing that's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Having, like having a specific spot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need to be in every week, like a job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And when we have to take holidays now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we have to tell the boys,
and put in our holiday time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs)
To be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, I'm going to be away for this week." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean we could just like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Put in the hours ahead of time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We could just like, not
have Trash Tastes some weeks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but then also it's like, why? Why not? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We can easily just make it every week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not a fan of like the whole, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not uploading on holidays. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I only like some of my audience
celebrates set holidays, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I don't feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's fair to just be
like, "Oh fuck you guys." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> People who don't celebrate
the same holidays as me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not giving you content, I'm busy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a valid excuse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think in some ways, when
you let your busy part, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I also like uploading. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I like the Trash Taste uploads </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every, every, every week no matter what. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like no matter how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normal people are doing,
it's like you can expect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you're gonna get a
Trash Taste every week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's called like comfort food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I liked that about
channels I watch that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That like no matter where I am, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if 'cause sometimes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe Christmas I got some downtime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for an hour or two, I might watch a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's coming out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I'm really excited for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like it, I like it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, the thing about Christmas right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's that okay, so you have,
you have the beginning right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You wake up early with the family. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You open presents, and
everyone opens their presents. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone's all merry and happy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So what happens between like
11 o'clock to four o'clock. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Food and alcohol. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Food, alcohol and check this out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You saw this on TV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Food comes on at four right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Food comes out about four. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't have like all Christmas lunch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean like okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, wait, wait, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's for Christmas lunch? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wherever you want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whatever you envisioned
a dinner to be, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm about to have like an all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can eat buffet for dinner. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You better know that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm saving space for
that Christmas dinner. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well no I have that buffet at lunch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then don't have dinner. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have both. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because during dinner
time I'm busy getting drunk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, dinner time, Christmas dinner! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like one of the
best meals of the year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We don't do that in Australia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you do in Australia? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Australia, we wake up we have, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we open up all the presents or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then by that time
it's around lunchtime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then all the family comes over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have like kind of a late lunch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe like two, three o'clock type of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like big, big lunch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Finish at like 5:00 pm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then that's when you get
shit-faced with your family. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And by the time dinner time rolls around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're not hungry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because your still full
from the massive lunch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I have lunch and
dinner, Christmas time pig... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a lunch and dinner. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - For me It's like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's one big meal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No it is one big meal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have two big meals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How can your stomach handle that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's Christmas baby. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The Christmas spirit man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> This is the largest my
stomach by four times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The reason we don't
have a Christmas lunch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or I've never heard of anyone
having a Christmas lunch, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is because I'm pretty sure
during Christmas dinner, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you eat enough to like fill
yourself up for a fuckin week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes like you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> friends who can't come to
the dinner or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, we can meet them
for lunch or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're going out on Christmas Day! What! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Blasphemy! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I go to their house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What, you don't spend
it with your family? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no. I'll spend the
dinner with my family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause maybe there's someone who I must... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't spend all
day with your family? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, not all the
time. Sometimes I do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It depends on like who I can
see, when and when I can't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some people they have like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're having a Christmas thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'll go and say hi, I'll turn up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I'll go back and
spend the evening with family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So like last time I went
back to Australia, I did that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I spent like a Christmas dinner </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with my friend at my friend's
place, like my uni mate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I did that the day after
the actual Christmas event. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> As like a late Christmas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of thing.
- [Garnt] Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like on Christmas day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if I'm not at home with my family, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> then something's wrong in the family. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If I'm not at home
(laughs) with the family </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or we're not going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to another one of our
family's relatives' places. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Then some beef </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is going on.
- Something is weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some of them are friends,
some of them are family. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's kind of a mix, depends who it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay but like my justification </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the Christmas lunch in Australia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that you have to understand that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Christmas day is a very nice summer day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right so, going outside,
eating a massive thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> by a pool side is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughs)
very normal in Australia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, pass me the Turkey,
I'm in the pool right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you don't have a roast? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, we do. But outside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It gets cooked with the
sun 'cause it's so hot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We pop up a whole... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you just have a
fuckin barbecue basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not even, we just go out onto the road </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just pop a whole
chicken on the tarmac. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it just cooks
by itself and it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ( Joey mimics happy voices)
- It's done five minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No but like, it's like
reazly, like 34°C, 35°C, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like nice summer day right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're out on the
balcony with your family. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're having a nice roast, or pork, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever it is that
you eat during Christmas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And we have that during the day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the sun's out and it feels good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's, that's my justification of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why we have one meal at like two o'clock. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I obviously, if it was like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's so alien to me right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously it feels
like winter time right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not gonna go out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, so okay PM right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, as someone who obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> grew up in Australia
celebrating Christmas that way, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you have like this Christmas-y feeling, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like what, do you have
a Christmas-y feeling? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or do you have anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that gives you a Christmas-y feeling? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah Christmas-y feeling is when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm having a beer at
like 2:00 pm in a pool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That could be that's like
any day for Australians Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It is (chuckles) every day Christmas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hell yeah it is Dawg! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it like weird
watching Christmas movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We don't watch Christmas movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - At all? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't, at least our family doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Australians do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you have like a
Christmas spirit? Like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it like a dating site. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why are you sharp Joey,
tell us where you was at? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember 'cause, when I
live in Thailand, me and Sydney </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> celebrated Christmas there
for like two or so years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Every year she'd tell me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "You know what, the trees are up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "we've got the Christmas songs on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "the roasters out." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it doesn't feel like Christmas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She says as, as it is like 35°C </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like hot outside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just doesn't feel (laughs)
- Turn on the AC. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It doesn't feel like Christmas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know, it just doesn't
feel like Christmas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean yeah I know, we put
up a tree and everything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and we decorated it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we'll put the lights
on it and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's also, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm in my board shorts and
T-shirt at the same time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That just doesn't sound festive to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like board shorts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> board shorts, T-shirts, Christmas hot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a great photo of me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like just with exactly that getup, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> standing in front of the Christmas tree, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sweating my nuts off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was like 38°C like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So like, is there like
a certain period of time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you see something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, Christmas is coming up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause for me, like in England, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was whenever, the weather would start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting like really cold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you'd start seeing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Christmas decorations
pop up here and there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is it like in Australia? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the same thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You see...
- Is it the same? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Christmas decorations pop up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But at the same time, it's like oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I gotta start taking this jacket off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - My God! That's so bizarre. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's how we do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you get any houses which
like go absolutely mental </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the Christmas decorations? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is so odd. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the problem is because
it's the summertime right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You can't turn the lights
on until it's like 9:00 pm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's still bright outside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel so sorry for fuckin Santa Claus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And like with like a hot red jacket. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh he ain't in a hot red jacket. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He has no shirt on dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's in red board shorts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Usually no shirt, on a surfboard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you have like snowmen
decoration and shit like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no we know actually... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does it snow in Australia? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - In some parts it does yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So in Canberra it does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But not where I'm from no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't get cold enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like the coldest it'll
get maybe it's like 10°C. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah yeah, but again like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that happens in July
for us, not Christmas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs)
- That's strange. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's Christmas for you Connor? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What'd you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's your Christmas spirit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's your Christmas spirit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm I being interrogated
for my Christmas? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, yeah come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is your Christmas? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - His Christmas is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> not spending the whole
day with his family. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like spending the day with my family. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is Christmas like a special day for you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not, not like, does it
mean something to you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but like, you know what I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's just like, it's
Christmas just like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The day, I'm indifferent towards. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't feel anything
particular on the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like spending, It's a good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like the idea of spending
time with the family. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I shut up, fuck yourself Mark
Zuckerberg right now, don't I? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I like human activity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I like seeing people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "on the day of the 25th." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I'm cooking a skillet." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "With sweet barbecue rice." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sorry, but Mark Zuckerberg meme's are... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love that meme. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To me it's like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno I like watching the
Christmas movies. They're fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like the jingle all the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's my favorite one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jingle all the way. What's that one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's where Arnold Schwarzenegger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tries to buy that figure for his kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I didn't know
the name of that movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love that movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That movie is so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like my favorite Christmas movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like Christmas Eve a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as well actually with my family. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause everyone's kinda like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's trynna warm up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's kind of like getting the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah getting that family vibe yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause Christmas Eve
for us is a normal day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We don't do anything special. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause you see because were nine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We kinda like all,
kinda like talk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Watch TV or drink. Have a nice meal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause we don't talk otherwise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not as like a collective family unit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll talk to my mom and dad
or then I'll go somewhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then my brother will
tell, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's never like the
whole units together. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Even now because, me and my family, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> all of us live in... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Me and my brothers all
live in different areas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My brother's gonna go
to Canada now as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, it's gonna be even harder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get everyone in the same place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was the difficult one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I was on the
other side of the world, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but now Evans is gonna
be the difficult one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, hopefully I'll get to see. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I didn't get to
see my older brother </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I went back to the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause he was busy doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff in Scotland I think, or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You going back this year? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well the Christmas this year? No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't wanna deal with travel again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I lost enough in my lifetime worth, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but 'cause you didn't go to America </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to see Sidney's family right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I guess that's fair enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't have anything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I saw my family. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> They got to see me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like I'll see you next year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll probably go back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> at some point in April or
something and see them again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was it your parents that said that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they would probably never come to Japan? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (soft upbeat music)
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why is that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. They never said that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They wanna go to Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why not next time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when the country opens up they come here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah maybe that too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I don't think, they
haven't come to Japan before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have they?
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - My parents really wanna
come to Japan as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I bought them, my Christmas
present was flights for them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh hell yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Last year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Group laughs)
- Oh, well you go there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do Christmas presents rollover? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You haven't redeemed it yet so? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got my own man fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's sitting there, waiting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, I know they want to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they really, really want to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I know that they've, I've
really sold them on the idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When I first moved here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they weren't too hyped on it
but after they've watched, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after I moved here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they kind of watched a
lot more stuff about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're really excited to come. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is great because I can't wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to see how utterly confused they are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah now I'm really
excited for them to come over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah that'll be fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - When was the last time
you did spend Christmas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with your family then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it must been in a while right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The one before Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So, 2019 I was in Japan right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 2019 Christmas then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's must been a long time man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay so yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fuck, fuck man.
- It's three years bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, three years ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause the first Christmas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd just moved to Japan in October </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was kinda settling in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like I won't come back, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll come back next year, Next Christmas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That didn't happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then they didn't come
by this Christmas either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you guys ever cook for Christmas? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Or who does the cooking for Christmas? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My dad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - My dad yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it's like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Spends like 12 hours the day before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - My dad spends like two days. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So like what I've always wondered is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when does the torch get passed over right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When you got your own kids Garnt, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs)
'cause you have no choice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hopefully not for a while. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I need a lot of catching up to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause yeah I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I've started cooking
my own roast as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I kinda like how my roast cooked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I don't think it's
as good as my mom's yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gunning for it eventually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I also... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Gunning for the title. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also I don't know when in my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to like spend my entire day cooking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because when you cook </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a Christmas day...
- Never. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're just like, as a kid, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have comfort in knowing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like the parent's job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like deal with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're out here having
fun with your family. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're out there just
cooking and all that shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for an entire day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when is that gonna be my job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm kind of dreading that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - When a little baby man
is appeasing your life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess that's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs)
that's when you can start. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey don't lie, you're
just gonna make Aki do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You gonna be like, honey, honey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, every Thanksgiving, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> she spends like an
entire day cooking food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh fuck that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Group laughs)
I'm not dong that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are you kidding me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Here to enjoy the fruits of her labor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly I get to just
enjoy the food right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, yeah I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I've been thinking that too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause like every time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I guarantee when
I go back for Christmas, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which I will be by the
time this comes out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My dad is gonna force me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It'd be like, "Son, it's
time you learnt the way." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. He's gonna
be in the other room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He's gonna email you, "Dear son..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, "Dear son." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's gonna leave a YouTube comment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Dear son come </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in the next room."
- Yeah in my last video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey son help me with the roast." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah but like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every time I do go back home, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause he cooks every night. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You've gotta learn
the family recipe right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah right and like I've learned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> some of recipes.
- Wait what's your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dad's like specialty? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - My dad's specialty? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> My dad's specialty is Moroccan chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow! That seems Nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, he bought like this,
like proper, like Moroccan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a pot type of thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that has like the kind
of funnel lead on it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like apparently
what they use in Morocco. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Please correct me if I'm wrong about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, it's like
spiced Moroccan chicken, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dates and lemons.
- Do they sound bomb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm definitely gonna get them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to make that when I go back home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it also takes like six hours to make. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean I love to have that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah every week in my house, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I also don't wanna
invest in a fuckin pot, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> let alone spend six
hours cooking this thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That just means you haven't reached </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that point in life yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> When you settle down in a house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're were just like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe I have some spare
time to start a hobby. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe I should... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause there are some like kitchen ware, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which you never use, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apart for like that one event in the year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When you're like a
teenager, you're just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why would I need this thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is just taking up space right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hardly have any space
in my kitchen as it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But now especially
moving into my new house, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember going to Connor's
house and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh Connor this cutlery. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It feels good. It feels good Connor God! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This isn't Daiso cutlery. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I bought IKEA's finest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did actually feel a little bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like when I helped Aki
last year for Thanksgiving. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she made like a Turkey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a whole Turkey thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause we bought an oven finally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the gratifying feeling of me going, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Honey, bring out the oven tray." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Aw! This is special day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We never bring this thing out oh my God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Aw! This is a special event. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I am gonna be like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm already like that with like tools. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I've slowly... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like which kind of tools? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like DIY like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like hammers and like all
that kind of shit right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I still don't own a
hammer. Not in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] I don't own an hammer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hammers are quite useful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah they are quite useful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - A mallet maybe, like a rubber
mallet is like pretty good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have a rubber mallet so I use it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When do you need it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you need a hammer
- You never know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But when you need it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like thank God for
fuckin saying that loud. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - When have you needed one in Japan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like having to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knock some screws out
of place or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or nail some things down to like prop, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe an artwork up or
something, or you whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - One time my IKEA table was
being annoying with the screw. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I needed a hammer to like push it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - making like tables and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you just kinda knock it in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's coming a lot more, I can't tell you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every use I've had for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I remember I've had
multiple times I've been like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thank God I finally bought a hammer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah now that 'cause like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> our current place that we're in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause we have two balconies right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like building those balconies, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I am missing like 90% of essential tools. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So I just went out a day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like Tokyu Hands or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And just like binged,
like buying, binge-bought. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just like spooshed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on all these tools.
- All that's yours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey, doesn't binge AnimE anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Binge is tools. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Binges is hardware. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Binge is his wallet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the most fun shopping experiences </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've had in a long time.
- Dou you ever power drill? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I sure do buddy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God! Do you ever power? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Where can you use a power drill in Japan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Many places. 'Cause
after while 'cause like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially when you're buying furniture, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like when you first move. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So when I was first building my room, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have a much bigger room now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just gonna replace all of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the desks, and like
shelves and everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like much bigger, nicer place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that fit the atmosphere right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, obviously when you
buy stuff from like IKEA, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or Amazon or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that don't come in one piece, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you gotta fuckin DIY that shit all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I've definitely been feeling that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for like the past few weeks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't you hate it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Twisting the fuckin screwdriver
for 17 hours in the week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And to the point where
your wrist and your thumb </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> starts to get sore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do not regret not buying one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] I guess so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do, I bought my furniture at the Mall, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I regret not buying it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, when I bought like my new bookshelf, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was still had the screw right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I was like, oh good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This bookshelf has 50 screws
that I have to screw in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're hard as shit as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> By the time I finished
like three hours later </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my hands were so sore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was like, fuck it
I'm buying a power drill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because though I had
another shelf coming in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> built that shit in like 30 minutes cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause all I had to do with screw. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey mimics screw sound) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey mimics breathes heavily) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> technology, is amazing, is incredible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Remember when IKEA
selling point was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that you get to build your own furniture, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like all convenient and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've ordered some furniture off Amazon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which doesn't need to be built. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, this
is a fuckin godsend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> They're ahead of the game man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some IKEA products, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think you can pay them
to assemble in your house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah you can, you can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because sometimes IKEA furniture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are actually are really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like they have somethings that are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really, really good.
- No IKEA has great furniture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pay me yens to make. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, especially
moving into a new place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Making one or two things
that ain't too bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's, that's a fun afternoon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When you're making like
10 fuckin things in a day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Can't these things just come pre-built. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And there are some like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there some IKEA things where like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even the way that you have to build, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is like some kind of autistic feat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like fuckin algebra one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get like a fuckin piece in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it just looks so weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the construction thing and so urgh! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - My table kind of broke a little bit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and one of the screws is missing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I should be fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly it happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One of the biggest things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of the biggest things
that annoys me is that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now that I've built so much furniture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in the past few weeks, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I know what kinda packaging </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just like good and optimized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs)
And what is awful right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So, like I was building a shelf yesterday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And like every single screw, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every single compartment, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every single plank, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had like a number sticker on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All like came in, came in a bag </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was labeled as a certain number. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you look at the
instruction manuals and you see ah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> These number of screw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goes into this number plank. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fuckin hate the furniture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that gives you a bag of screws. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you get the instruction manuals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it gives you like 10
different tonne of screws. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And doesn't tell you... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they all look the same.
- And they all look the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - IKEA does that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it fuckin like blows my mind feeling, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to like, it's so fuckin hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to differentiate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like a screw that's this length, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and a screw that this length
on the instruction module. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that could be one of 10 screws. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Which screw I'm I supposed to you use. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The one I hate more than that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like when it tells you like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, you have this many screws right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you should have 10 screws. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I go to count and I'm
like, why is there 11 screws? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's not the screw. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I realize one is
just there for a spare right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But they don't tell you it's a spare. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you just have to assume
that one of them is a spare. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's like okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because when you finish building it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you realize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you look down and there's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three screws left over, you're like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Well I clearly fucked up somewhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes in Japan they give you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a pair of gloves with your furniture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause for some reason you need, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's to not hurt your hands
I guess when you build it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They give you like a pair of white gloves. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's really, I don't know it's cute. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's really cute, I never wear them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm like, why the
fuck would I wear gloves? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't like, they give you
these shitty screwdrivers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like Allen keys and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I feel like It's such a waste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I buy like eight things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I have eight shit screwdrivers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I have to get rid of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have a cupboard of just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> unused Allen keys.
- The shit screwdrivers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like the shitty screwdrivers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> are less common than the Allen keys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I put my own set of Allen keys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> They are all like perfectly measured, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're great, really good quality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's so much better
than using these tiny ones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where you like destroy your Palm, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trynna do that last turn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They clearly don't understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the concept of torque </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with some of these.
- They're not long enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Dongs ones are really
long, they're really good.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so easy to just like turn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unlike the quality of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reasons, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There are some furniture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that the quality of the screws, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all over the place.
- Holy shit! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's some that are just
like perfectly ingrained. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can get your stuff in.
- Damascus Steel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Enhanced Nails. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then there are some which I swear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are like pre-sheared. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So like you turn it and it's
like a fuckin ice skate right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just slipping in and out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, how am I supposed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to get this screw in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The worst feeling is when you like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go for that, you take this
much of the screw is still out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you turn it and you feel it shear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And you look at it, and
it's like already sheared. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like fuck! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's makes like that horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey mimics screw drivers turning) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have to like fully like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> put your full pressure
on it, and not stop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause if you let go or
It'll like shear it more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You'll be like fuck I've gotta get this in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> before I fuck this up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is everyone keeping on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what we're talking about right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just furniture things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just middle-aged guy things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah I've just noticed that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> since, having the balcony </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and having so many like
new things to build. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've really enjoyed building furniture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like on ironically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey I'm just buying
furniture I don't need. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Come into my house
and build my furniture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all I've been doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly dude, I'll happily do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's actually so fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know it's like...
- I bet he won't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> If you actually like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs)
"Joey, come around this time." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - He says this on camera,
camera toes off yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor mimics Joey)
- "I'm busy that day." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, honestly like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if you like buy me launch or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll like dead ass help you out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you ever like consider
making your own furniture? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like going proper DIY. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Like buying
the wood and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah buying the wood.
- I have actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> thought about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But at the same to.
- Same to buy what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to make what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno, just something, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, maybe like a table
of fuckin out on the whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Merge on table. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs)
- I have thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about it actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I have actually thought about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like yeah because I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I took woodworking like classes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a little bit in like
uni, because it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a thing that we had to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, it's weird because
I'd specifically remember, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I fuckin hated that course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I really did not
like doing like DIY shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's not until ,
suddenly I have like moved, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've got all this like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think you know what it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not that I enjoy DIY, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's that I like the feeling
of getting new furniture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So, that just changed
drastically as opposed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's like, I think it's well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like it's nice because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean you guys have seen me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in this like trance-like state </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'm building shit around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Where like I literally just turn on music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I just, I'm in my own world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as I'm like making furniture,
or like whatever it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When I'm making something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I like that feeling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's almost meditative to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like the feeling of buying furniture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's, that's a good feeling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like I knew I was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like eating on my furniture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckles)
when it's done though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I knew I was odd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you go through the IKEA catalog </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, that's a good
looking desk right there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Catalog, now you're gonna
go there in person Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But to go to the IKEA mega store. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You gotta sit down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You gotta feel the chat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You gotta consider the furniture way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> All that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everything needs to be considered. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Consider the color
of it, the feel of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> When did buying furniture become fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude fuck! Welcome to adulthood baby. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what was the
most annoying part of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I bought that IKEA grass shit right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shit like generic grass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that goes on your floor.
- Patio. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whatever the fuck you want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I wanted to have some grass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could like, it feels nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It feels good, It feels good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I bought it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Turns out though, those IKEA grasses, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the one thing that sucks
about them is that like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't measure them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (soft somber music) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't like fit them in precisely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like they either fit or they don't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you can nearly have some of your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> belt patio covered or you won't right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause they're like squares. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think they're like five by five. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh you got the squared tiles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I got the ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just got the roll 'cause
my balcony is massive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well 'cause IKEA does like
square tiles of fake grass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And so I didn't really
consider how it would fit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but I've roughly measured it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought I was too far,
fuckin like it, fuck it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I realized that I can't block the drain, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the water drain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Otherwise, no water again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, then I was like okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, now I either have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a big chunk of my patio not covered, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it looks weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or I have my drain cover drawn, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't do, so I was like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why not cover it with like there's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I know the tiles, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like a wood tile
which has holes in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can you just put that there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have some wood tile on the other side. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What about if you get the square </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and you cut a hole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that partly fix the drain.
- So here we go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then you can just plop it on top. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause that's what I did at my place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh okay, so what I
did, it's not, it's not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not like one big drain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The drains in the corner somewhere else. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's like the thing
that leads into the drain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Something to be going in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, okay fuck it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cut the shit in half. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like rock solid plastic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] No I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is impossible to cut the shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like what tools
did you use to cut it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - My willpower. I literally
like, got this piece of plastic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A ball saw. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like this big right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not even a saw, I literally just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bent it together with my hands </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this right.
(Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I just kept bending it like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it weakened, and then
I did it the other way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the other way it's all plastics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it hurts your hands to bend
it but wasn't fuckin bending. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So bend it the other way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just kept doing this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it got loose enough
where I got some pliers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like cutting the plastic along. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jesus Christ! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And its so goddamn long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I had the problem of okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because of how these tiles work, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's only like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's two sides, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the one 90 corner, 90°C. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This side and this side </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> are like the holes that you connect it to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And these sides have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the clips that it clips into. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I had this problem now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where some of the clips in
well, some of it doesn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm like, don't step on that one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when people go to the balcony. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's just all gonna like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fuckin break and fall
apart when you step on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it looks nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> We got it perfect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah it looks nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hurt my hands and
it took so goddamn long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why I like the roll variety </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's designed to be cut. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like I didn't have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a big enough area to warrant a whole roll. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause it was a small area. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just wanted grass. I
wanted to see more green. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause in my previous place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I just had like the wood things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> The wood tiles.
- Those are nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which look nice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but also, I think I just
prefer the feel of fake, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> even if it's fake grass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fake grass is nice to feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why I got some parts wood, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just for, to have that
over the house. (mumbles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I have a grasp of where my feet go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's something
about with touching grass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with your feet feels good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What can I say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we touch grass.
- Yeah, we touch grass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I touch grass every morning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Next time you consider insulting me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Remember I have grass, and that I touch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Even if it's fake grass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whenever I see you
calling this is touch grass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like don't mind if I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I go out to my balcony. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ah! So much grass.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you have a garden in Australia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you were growing up? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you ever do the gardens? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, my dad had a massive garden. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, now that my dad's retired, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like all he does. Gardening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Would you ever consider a garden? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know I want a garden. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna look after said garden. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the point right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> The idea of a garden's nice because, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have a garden in our English home. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> As you know, you've been there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there was a point in time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where my parents would
just go to Thailand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there was a point in time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I would work from
home, at that house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, in the months that were away, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I noticed that the garden </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just progressively looked like shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs)
And the grass would grow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it was at that
point where I realized, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, someone's gonna
take care of this garden </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for it to look good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's so much effort. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a big garden.
- Garnt these garden </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> plants are alive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's true Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's true
- Plants are living things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And ever since then, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the idea of a garden is nice but just... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen a lot of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Sidney's house is
like a massive garden. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you can lose like
half a day or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just like taking care of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - My dad regularly spends
multiple days taking care of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Multiple days? And I'm just like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He loves it there.
It's like his new child. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But it looks amazing to be fair. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He does a really good job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But to me it's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how to do is.
- I think I would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> absolutely love it if I had
the time to take care of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We haven't got to that age yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> We can appreciate, just
being able to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pull out the lawn mower. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Have your coffee, or your
beer, and just go at it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes. Just grab a hose
and just hose down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that a good thing? I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like when you get older, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you probably enjoy those pleasures more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't care to enjoy it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I remember when I was a kid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> my mom would be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt, go cut the grass now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's your turn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like for fucks sake! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They never made me do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I did a lot of the other chores. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh they made me do that,
I just fuckin hated it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because to me it was, my dad was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not letting him do it, it's my garden. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's mine, he's gonna fuck it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My dad was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if you don't do it,
then no dinner tonight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Okay yes father." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I do it, and I hated it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had to do everything else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why I like the fake grass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "You're not grow." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hated putting up the laundry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I hated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I still hate putting out the laundry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is what Sydney does actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Sydney loves that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the way it was in my house is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we had lodged a line and a big stick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that props up the line in the middle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, it was always fuckin annoying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it was windy doing this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was like smaller as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this pole is massive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I hated doing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mom, these were pressed
memories by the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey chuckles)
I don't like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing the laundry now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's because of you, Joey? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Childhood trauma. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I fuckin hate that pole, piece of shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They still use this pole as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Get a new pole. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Get a better pole.
- Upgrade your pole. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get a new pole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I remember, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember when I moved
to my new place and, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause one of the big thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about my new place that we've added, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is a dishwasher. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which as you guys now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you guys have dishwashers now right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I sure do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, completely changed my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> At the beginning, my mum was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my mum my entire life, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Has been like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we don't need dishwasher. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My family doesn't need dishwasher. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's just, that's just wasteful water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's just like your water
bill, and your electricity bill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is gonna go up, go up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The moment I found out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the dishwashers use
significantly less water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, well that's my excuse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the rest of the timeline. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, I'm never, ever, ever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> washing the hands-like dish again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like you guys you're
killing the environment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't possibly watch whatever it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And ever since like I've
moved into my new place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like I've shown my mum the dishwasher. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And just like how much
less effort it takes to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wash dishes after you cook. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Will you have like a zoom
call with her and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Mom look, I press the go button." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - She's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "I could be looking for a
dishwasher for Christmas." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Got em. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey mimicking Anime tone)
- Conversion complete. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like where was
this my entire life mom? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Was I just your dishwasher
your entire life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and now that I'm gone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you need an actual dishwasher? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that it?
- Pretty much yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's pretty yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] I see how it is mom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I see how it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Children are just cheap
appliance-like conversions right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like, I could spend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of money on a lawnmower. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Or I could get my son to do
it, with the shitty lawnmower. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, when I have children, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you bet your ass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs)
they get much old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to do the chores.
- You're really describing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> why people had kids like
hundreds of years ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs)
That's why they had so many. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause they'll like well, I can't do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you that get married
into a household was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> all right how many things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do we need to do every day? Seven. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All right, prepare to have seven kids. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not paying for an
assistant. I'm getting a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - My PA is gonna be my kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sell my stock son.
What will you be selling? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hiring and clean out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like privileged rich people shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Getting a kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs)
now that's the real shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a lie fuck right there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One thing, sorry to go on a tangent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just realized fuck kids for real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Please don't, please don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not that kind. Don't play Samsung music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One thing that I hope I
get less of next year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> The only regret is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't told these fuckin NFT companies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that email me every day to fuck off! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck off! Stop emailing
me about making NFT. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck off! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We all get them and I just... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's not just emails,
it's tweets as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you know notice
on some of the tweets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's just like a bot
that gets like retweeted, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like, you can buy like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how me tweeting about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Anime TDS or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has anything to do with fuckin NFTs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's either this bot saying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey, you can do something with this NFT." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or it's this one guy who every
tweet is consistently like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey, you should read this one model." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I never got a visibly
angry email before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but this one made me like, I shouted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was this one, where it says, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Business invitation from the
most anticipated NFT game." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never wanted to hear
that string of woods ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the fact that I got that email </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made me actually...
- What the fuck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is an NFT game? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (crew murmurs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know! I don't
want it! Stop emailing me! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate this bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> If you're into it, that's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't mind, but why do they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shove it down our throat? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck off! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it's NextGen dude, it's NextGen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone needs to be up to
date on that NextGen shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause what it feels like is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this thing is this thing that I have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like very little knowledge about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just getting shoved
down my throat right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I understand it and I don't like it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't even understand
and I still hate it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because of the shit that they like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the fuckin stuff they say on Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like mind numbing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate it's like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Twitter since NFTs has
become somewhat worse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't understand how Twitter got worse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like NFTs made Twitter
so much more wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then every goddamn YouTuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like somehow using NFTs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like scams as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's awful.
- Are they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So many YouTubers using NFT </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for like scamming stuff.
- Can you explain to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and perhaps the audience
that doesn't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Explain it like I'm five. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck even is an NFT? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, there's like a... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're basically buying the proof </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you own a piece of artwork right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's digital right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's a digital piece of artwork. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not a physical piece, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but in the blockchain which is kind of... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not getting into that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs)
- Yeah don't go into that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Explain it like I'm five. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Explain it like I'm five. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - In like proof to the
world that you're... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Essentially you are paying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for the proof that you
own something right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the most basic
way I can explain it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you get a token
that can't be replicated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to say you own this thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it's like a certificate
of authenticity kinda. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's exactly what it means. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why people are buying
artwork, digital artwork, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like ridiculous
amounts of money because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in a sense, even though you can (chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right click and save as that one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Group laughs)
- Got em. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like there's a token, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like a certificate that says </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you own the "Original"
piece of the artwork. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so fuckin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even though it's like digital. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's dumb as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have friends, good friends, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who like have made a lot of money from it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's what they do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And they produce them themselves and they, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's all for them. I
don't mind them doing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not like you can't do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like just this whole aspect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of shoving it down everyone's throat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just a craze. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because people are
trynna make money from it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So the only way to get
money and make money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> from a a lot of them, not
all of them are scams. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There are a lot of scams as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There are so many scams. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's like so
many scandals and stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause there's no regulation or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So do people like by certain NFTs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then resell them at a higher </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> price or something.
- Yeah, a lot of it yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it's just like an investment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (group laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's how they frame it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's how they phrase it yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the stuff like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's been stuff like insider trading </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where like websites that
sell NFTs and showcase them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They have like things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> There was like one case where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this thing where they basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> promote an NFT every week, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they guy, one of the
like COOs or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> new which NFT was coming up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So he would buy a bunch of that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that type of artwork. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then when it went up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he would sell it and make a ton of money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But there's no laws against it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's not considered insider trading </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's cryptocurrency. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The siren police isn't gonna come. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So there's like this, it's
just the wild west right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And for some people it's
great. They love that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a place where, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because there's no rules,
there's no regulation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of people can get scammed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of people can make...
- A lot of scams. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of money very, very fast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just kind of like a
toxic environment right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah and it sounds like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I get so many scams. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I hate the fact that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> YouTubers have started
promoting them and doing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course they have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It' fuckin awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh you have really is
my NFT yeah yeah..." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is like a shame 'cause I like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like the idea and the technology </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has like so much potential, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and now it's just being used for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really shitty things basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And there's also the criticism </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that it's terrible for the environment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and stuff like that and whatnot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait how's it terrible
for the environment? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh 'cause the (mumbles). Oh God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do I have to go do my own research? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The way that like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how the system works, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it uses a shit ton of computing power </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to have the blockchain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's quite inefficient in general, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it wastes a lot of energy to
run these fuckin nonsense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically like, some
of these cryptocurrencies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the moment, have as much energy usage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as some countries to run right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Genuinely (chuckles) It's insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like the network that NFTs run on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which is called Ethereum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think uses as much energy as like Sweden </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or one of those countries. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not like this boomer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who's like anti-progress
and anti technology. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm all for like good technology. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it just feels like
the way it's been going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is such a fuckin mess and
it's like, it's just awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, because it's actually
been shoved down my throat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I did actually do like
my research and reading </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into this thing because like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if there's this thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like I like to understand things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the problem now is that,
it's just so fuckin you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that nobody knows what
the fuck to do with them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the wild west. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like as like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as the years progress and
it becomes more stable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then this could, there is
potential for this technology </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be used for something actually good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it will, I feel like it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this technology will be more sustainable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the future as well as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cryptocurrency is kinda figure out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey, let's build a system that doesn't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "like burn the entire Amazon rainforest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "to get running right." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I feel just right now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it is like, I'm staying
the fuck away from this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah I'm not touching
it like they need... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Although that's the last thing they want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It does need some kind of
regulation in some sense, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to stop all these fuckin scams. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the reason why I know
how many scams there are, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is because they always reach out to us, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to ask us to promote them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's so many that
ask us to promote them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this is like this
fuckin nonsense and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, we're like a Badger
Poop NFT, wanna... " </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like fuck off! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs)
Just fuck off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's so crazy.
- Are you looking forward to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> NFTs being added to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your favorite video games? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs)
- Oh my God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think if it gets to a
point where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not like fuckin burning
the planet and it's chill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's not so scummy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like real, like I see this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like the CSGO skin community </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like salivating right now. Oh my God! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs)
Yeah NFT skins and memes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> surprise came over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It'll probably get there at some point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can see it happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can easily see it happening, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you having one of a kind skin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just like so out of the loop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with like that kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like NFT, crypto and shit...
- Honestly good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like this is what
my grandma must have felt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when VR was introduced. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like where it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just can't wrap my head around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I did ask, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when you said Ethereum, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like oh okay yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've heard of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the first time I heard Ethereum. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, I'm pretty
sure you can collect that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in StarCraft right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that's what it sounded like to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I was like, oh wait no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a crypto thing, okay
nevermind I don't wanna... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel very old right now my bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the only trend I
hope changes or dies down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all I want. I don't
care about anything else. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just stop it now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just want some
actual cool applications </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that are not just selling
overly priced artwork, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is just the exact
same fuckin artwork. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The amount of times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen that monkey NFT.
- Oh my fuckin God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like with just different skins. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even know what that monkey NFT is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - "I've got the skin moist
wearing the pirate hat," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like fuck off! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you realize how stupid this sounds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Oh God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - At least if some guy spends
talking $200 on a Monet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> he's got a fuckin Monet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think that's good either, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but at least he's got the fuckin painting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Didn't burn down the
rainforest to get a fuckin token. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I understand it's such a boom right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I hate all this stuff man
it sucks. The scam suck too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And yeah again, I hope
that it gets some kind of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I hope that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it claims up its act.
- Regulation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it stops being so shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah because like I was reading up about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the possible
applications NFTs could have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, you have a Non Fungible... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> NFT stands for No Fungible Tokens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So of course, right now it's been used </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as a certificate to say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you own this stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but it has like a lot more
applications above that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can think about hey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sending over certification
to say hey, this person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's say has a driver's license, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or is certified, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has a master's degree or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> along those lines.
- Along those lines yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where it's like one centralized unit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that anyone can check. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we don't rely on like some companies, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like forging driver's
license or documentation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or like have to got
all the way to like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or even thinking about house ownership </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or any kind of ownership. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The amount of fuckin paperwork. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Think of how much it
can revolutionize Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If there was one system that said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this person owns this,
and this person owns that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like, that's got
so much potential to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like reduce the paperwork by tenfold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You gotta give Japan time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They've just discovered
databases so like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Japan still uses the fuckin desk card. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They've just discover what Excel is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe like 30, 40 years time for them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think there's a lot of exciting things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it could be useful, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but right now it is... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds cool right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like yeah, that sounds
like a real life use. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember like, the only
piece of news I saw about NFT </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is when it was first popping up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was like the original Nyan cat GIF </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got like sold as an NFT for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some stupid amount of money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, who? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What I wanna know is, who sold it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And how did they prove that
they had ownership of it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it might've
been the original creator. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Crew Member] I think, even
like the original creator </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like, there's actually
a loophole for this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We can't actually like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This concept is actually
not applicable to what... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah that's, that's the biggest loophole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't understand.
- So what we're saying is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we can't authenticate whether
it's authentic or not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Group and crew laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Crew Member] Yeah,
that's what they've said. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Does that not seem ass backwards to you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Crew Member] Yeah, and
then someone took their image </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like "Ah, yeah, whatever." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My God! (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, there's still
a lot about this place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm not gonna, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm only gonna comment
on things that I do know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I just want less scums. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just to put it less scums. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Crew Member] So like for example like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a single Ethereum transaction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> consumes as much electricity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as an average US household
uses in a work week, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and has a covered footprint
equivalent to 140,893 Visa, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like for example Visa
credit card transactions, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or 10,595 hours of watching YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What the fuck! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (soft upbeat music) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So that's like every NFT transaction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's being made right now.
- That's fuckin insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Crew Member] So 10,000
hours of watching YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is more than that fuckin (mumbles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck! Why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah right now it is... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We truly live in a society. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Group and crew laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro, that's actually depressing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's so depressing to hear. Fuck! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What a way to end the year. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, happy new year gamers! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Hope you get a good one.
- Happy new year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hopefully next year you won't be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as depressed hearing that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Merry Christmas if you celebrate it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if not happy holidays, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if not, have a good day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm gonna buy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> an NFT of my favorite...
- Fuck off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fortnite narrative skin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I'm gonna buy.
- Oh my God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm fuckin getting out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Get me outta here. Get me outta here! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did they sell the GIF of Genjutsu? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Group laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want my resin gun,
thank you very much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Group and Crew laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Crew Member] He maybe out of chakra </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but he ain't out of bullets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He ain't out of bullets. </SPEAKER_03>
