<SPEAKER_05> - Did you get an
overwhelming amount of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in your Twitch chat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> asking if we were going to Garnt's wedding </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or when Garnt's wedding was?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - As if they were also planning to go? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - They were like, "You're
gonna film it, right?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, "No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> No." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Times people are like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> "So this is a 'Trash
Taste' special, right?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Joey fucking rocks up </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> with one of the fucking film cameras, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> just like, "Yeah, what's going on?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - GoPro on every corner of the room. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Connor's got a GoPro on his
fucking forehead like POV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> (gentle rhythmic music) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Welcome to this
episode of "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm Connor and I'm with
the boys, Joey and Garnt. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hey, guys.
- It me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How many weeks has it been?
- Many. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It has been many weeks-
- Like a month, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You do not know this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I've flown back to England </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and flown back to Japan in the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Since the last, not
even the last recording. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then you gotta
go a week later again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - So why'd you leave us, Garnt? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why did I leave? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Basically, I had to do
a marriage interview. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Now, normally people do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a year or something before their wedding, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but unfortunately, due to-
- (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, due to travel restrictions, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't have the opportunity
to go back to England </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to basically do this marriage
interview, which is legally- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, so fill me in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you have to do
at a marriage interview? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I'll- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can they be like, "Yeah,
you haven't got the job"? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh, I'll get- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - So why do you wanna get married? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll get into why I had to do it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but legally, if I wanted
to be married in the UK, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you need to give something
called a notice of marriage </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is basically you're
telling the government </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you're planning to get married </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and so it brings you to
the legal proceedings </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to allow you to get married. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Now-
- Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So normally you can do
that a year or months before. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Unfortunately, due to travel restrictions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and us not being able
to travel back to the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or just it being incredibly difficult, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we put that off and we put that off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we put that off and we put that off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you have to legally give it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least 28 days before you get married. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And by the time we gave it, it was 35 days </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before we got married, so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - So you're still in the guidelines. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's still in the guidelines </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was awkward because
I had to leave the boys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for two weeks or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like that kid who
finishes the assignment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the day before it starts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, I got plenty of time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I got a couple of hours left. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so I was looking at the schedule </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, "Fuck,
we got 'Trash Taste'" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and all this other work stuff
that we need to be doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I gotta give my notice of marriage </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> otherwise I can't legally get married </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've put this off
for as long as possible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it just makes it a bit awkward </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because otherwise, I would
have traveled back to the UK </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a little bit later. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because now I'm back just
for literally about eight days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just to do my filming commitments </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and film all the "Trash Taste"
episodes we need to film. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, yeah, I don't even know
if I'm going to tweet out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I'm back in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's honestly not worth it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause by the time I tweet it out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna be tweeting out,
"Okay, I'm back in the UK now." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And so another thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that this is probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the most timely "Trash Taste" episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you'll ever be able to see, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because we are filming
this, what, three days- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Three days. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Three days before it actually
airs or something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- It is, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so it's the one time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where we can talk about current topics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's the one time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's just like there
isn't really any current topics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to talk about.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Before we started, we were
like, all right, guys, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's finally time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> We can talk about some timely things. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And we just sat here for five minutes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to think of a timely subject. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And we couldn't think of anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We should just pick
something really irrelevant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, oh, that Will Smith slap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> That's crazy. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, but yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Basically this notice of marriage, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> it was mostly just
about lawful procedures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Connor] Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just making sure that we
can be lawfully married. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So normally they just
ask you normal questions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, I was being asked,
spell your fiance's name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is her name? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Hopefully I know her name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> They ask her-
- Wait, really? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> That's the gotcha? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's like, spell her name, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then asked, what is her birthday? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't actually know
what would have happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I failed, by the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What if I didn't know her birthday? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - You don't really love her, do you! </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - My last name's a pretty
tricky one to spell. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It makes no sense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> so if someone got it wrong, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it wouldn't be like, "Ooh,
ooh, ooh, oh, got 'em!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like people who have
dyslexia and have a- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my gosh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And have a Polish fiancee-
- So it's like a- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - With 17 Zs in it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just like, "Uh?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I think they wanna check </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's not a sham marriage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, of course, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like you're not getting married- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like you're not just doing
it for the VISA or anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But, yeah, hopefully you can
spell your partner's name, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know their birthday. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> If you don't, now that you
know what's gonna be asked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You need to know where
you're getting married. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - This'll be on the test. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is a test </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they separate you, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, "Okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're just gonna be asking some
simple questions, whatever." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And even though I know
it was simple questions, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just being separated, it was kinda like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it kinda felt like being
in an interrogation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, "Why are you here! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why are you getting married!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, "Is she your real wife? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is she gonna be your real wife?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was nothing bad like that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was just details about, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> basic details you hopefully should know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about your future wife
and everything like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then we get to the
end of the interview </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then they fucking throw
you a curve ball, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So here's me asking- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why are you gay? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Here's me being asked
to spell Sydney's name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is Sydney's name,
what is Sydney's birthday, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where are we getting married,
when are we getting married, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what are my parents' names,
et cetera, et cetera. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then out of nowhere,
they just ask you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Are you in any way related
to Sydney Ann Poniewaz?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, "What
do you mean, related? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> As in, brother, sister,
cousin, anything like that?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, hopefully I'm about to be. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just fucking, the
fucking "Oreimo" music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> starts playing in my mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, yo, is this
person a (indistinct) fan? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was so out of left field </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I literally just... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I let out a laugh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I looked him in the eye </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they just looked me dead
ass back, just like, "No." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> This is a serious question. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is a serious question. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "No, I am not related. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I am not brother or sister. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not her cousin or anything like that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - What if they were just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Does this song ring any bells?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And just plays "ClariS." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, "Does this give
you any weird feelings?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they actually said afterwards, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You'd be surprised how
many people say yes." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't realize I was getting married </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the state of Alabama here.
- Yikes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Apparently it's surprising
how many first cousins </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> try to get married in the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I guess there's a lot of groups </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that have a tendency to
marry within families. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you fail the test
if you say yes to that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Or do they just, they're like, "Okay." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know.
- Uh... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the incest test, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What happens if you fail the incest test? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I wonder. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] I got positive
on the incest test. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't legally marry if
it's certain closeness, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> You can't- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Can you marry first cousins? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I believe in the UK. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You definitely can't marry
if you're brother or sister, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not sure about first cousins. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, I didn't really- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How many degrees of separation- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Luckily, I'll never
need to worry about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - How many degrees of
separation does it have to be? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - Not that, I'm asking for a friend. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - This is like Google, when
you Google this too much, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> Google's like, "For real?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, he nasty, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Camera Person] Perfectly legal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for first cousins to marry in the UK. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it? Is it actually? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so if you say
yes to that question, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> then they'll be like, "We'll allow it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but we're just gonna silently judge." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because they didn't just ask, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> legally by blood, they were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "We include step siblings as well." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's "Domestic Girlfriend" all over again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt's like, "Please don't get horny, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> please don't get horny." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, "I've been
training my entire life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> for this moment." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did they know what
my favorite tags were? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just stands up, knocks the
coffee over with his boner. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just nervous, I
swear, I'm just nervous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - What do they want you to
do a 23andMe to prove it? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> What do they... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If you just say, "No," are
they like, "All right then"? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - 'Cause you look identical? No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, 'cause I was wondering </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> because we were legally, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> we had to legally prepare
most of the documents </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that we-
- Thought you were gonna say, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we were legally brothers then, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it was like, ah, we're legally cousins. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - No, so we had to prepare documents </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> which is all the standard documents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you would think you would need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to prepare for a marriage interview. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Your passport, your,
since we were flying in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your tickets for flying in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your proof of address, all
the standard legal documents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so everything else could be
easily proved via our documents. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how you prove
whether you're incest or not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What if you say, "Yes"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> What documents would you need to provide? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - They just fucking high five you, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they're like, "Nice, dude." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> (all laughing)
Nice. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> Me too, dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was just asking, I just wanna... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - That wasn't a legal-
- Anyway, you failed the test. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was just for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is there a fucking
incest Tinder or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I believe that's called
Facebook, isn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the code, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just Facebook, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you joined any of
these Facebook groups? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Was it hard to get the
marriage certificate? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, nah, kinda just documents? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I mean, I guess you've lived in Japan </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so maybe getting documents
for stuff is easy mode. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's actually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it's harder to get the documents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now that we live outside of Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because originally we
wanted a church wedding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the more we looked into it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fucking harder it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Mostly because one, I'm not Christian. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's only Sydney. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And also a lot of churches in the UK </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are very strict about who they
allow to get married there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or the priests. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So a lot of the times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you need to be a regular at the church. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And if you're not, already have attended </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're a kid or a regular
or your family goes there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you need to attend
for a month or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just so the priest knows you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that just wasn't an option for us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's hard enough
taking a two week holiday </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> away from the boys, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't just go back to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Guys, I gotta attend church for a month." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I gotta go to church. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I gotta see the Lord. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I gotta see the Lord, so, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Unfortunately we couldn't
get a church wedding, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you know, that's all fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> We can still. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everything is all ready now legally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We've booked the place.
- Nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We've booked the registrar.
- Nice, excited to go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am so excited to go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm so excited for you boys to go as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - All you can eat, right?
- Huh? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - All you can eat, right, I heard. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh yeah, boy! </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I won't spoil everything
that we have planned- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't do it, I'll be excited. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Before the wedding- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - My only question, is there food? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> That's all I need to know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There is food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, yeah, aside from
planning my own wedding, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I actually also was able to
attend a friend's wedding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> while I was back as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a very, very packed,
very, very packed trip for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I literally attended this wedding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the day after I flew back to Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to meet the other boys, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The other boys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - My other spouses, as Sydney says. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - My boyfriends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and it was so surreal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it was the first
mate's wedding I've been to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was so surreal
because a lot of weddings now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have been delayed to this year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause obviously with
COVID and everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That includes me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So this year is just
fucking packed for weddings. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I think you're-
- I'm going to three. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're going to three
weddings this year, aren't you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm going to yours, I'm
going to my friend's in Ireland </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I'm going to
my cousin's in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And all of them were supposed
to happen two years ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's just all this year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So a lot of weddings have
been postponed to this year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I basically just got, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I basically got to see what
a wedding is going to be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and seeing my mate get
married and everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and seeing everything from
the audience perspective </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before I'm up there,
standing up there myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You did the beta test. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did the beta test, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like, this looks pretty good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think we can go full launch soon. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and I'll be honest, mate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I was fucking nervous as fuck. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Holy shit.
- Really? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - But for someone else's wedding? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, someone else's wedding, right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I've known this guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for almost as long as
I've known Sydney, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I remember just being in the audience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and seeing him stand up there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and waiting for the bride to come out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just seeing him try to keep it together </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just made me think, "Fuck, man." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm feeling your nerves right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I know everything
he's going through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, "This
is gonna be me in a month." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought to myself,
"Fuck, if I'm this nervous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in the crowd, how am I going
to be when I'm up there?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> When I'm up there standing- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt just passes out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's gotta be an element
of stage fright, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you just have to do something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in front of all your friends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Kiss, kiss. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was actually so funny though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was like we
were waiting in the venue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where all the family was and
the groom was up there on stage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the wedding party and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know, they had
this beautiful harp playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everyone was silent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And then there was just
this small pause, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> As the harpist was
changing to the next song. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The bride was already, I
believe five to 10 minutes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after the ceremony had already
been scheduled to happen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So we weren't nervous,
but it was just tense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You could cut the tension with a knife. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone wasn't talking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then there was this brief silence. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then out of nowhere, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because Sydney was one of
the bridesmaids, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Out of nowhere, we just
hear in the corner, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just someone going, "Yes, God, yes!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And everyone just started laughing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the tension was gone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> tension was just instantly gone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Give whoever said that a metal plate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - But no, it was, yeah... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's weird attending a mate's wedding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm curious to see- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll let you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm curious to see how
you guys react as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause for me, I was
just, after it was over, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just such a nice feeling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was the most, like every
cliche you could imagine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's cliche in a nice way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it's how everyone
describes being at a wedding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you're just drunk on positive vibes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're just so happy for
the couple and the future </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the bride and the groom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just seeing them tie the knot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just seeing them go through all that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after you know both of them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and after you've seen them
build up their relationship. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just such a weird moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just to see everything culminate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into this one awesome moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's just awesome to be- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just so wholesome. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so wholesome.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God, I was just. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm still glowing from
positive vibes from that event. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm just like, "Damn, man." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I can't wait, I can't wait. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I can't wait. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm hype, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm very hype for it.
- I'm hype. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Interesting 'cause it's
like my friends in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and my friends in the UK
are gonna see each other. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - So it's the same thing for you. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's gonna be strange. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, 'cause I was
talking to Connor earlier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where mostly it's like,
for a lot of people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just gonna be our Japan lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and our UK friends
meeting for the first time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and Connor's the only one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who is kinda, got- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bridging between... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Bridging between both. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I know everyone, I'm pretty sure. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - He knows everyone, basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's gonna be interesting.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - 'Cause normally, when your friend groups </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> live in other countries, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't normally
interact with each other. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's gonna be really interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Actually, one of the funnest
parts of the wedding planning </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause we've been doing a
lot of wedding planning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> some of it's stressful, some of it not, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> but by far the most funnest points </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is I get to choose who
sits to next to each other- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Puzzle level difficulty. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just segregating all
the Japanese white people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> to one side- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - 10 out of 10 difficulty level puzzle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so a lot of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some wedding parties,
they do a soft segregation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> between the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Soft segregate... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it is what it feels like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Bit of discrimination is
always necessary, you know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - But it's not discrimination, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's soft segregation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what we're calling it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's what we're calling it, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because sometimes you go to a wedding, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can clearly see,
that's the family table, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the one friend group table, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the other friend group table. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - 'Cause you always have people
you have to invite, right, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> who you're like, I have to invite them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> but I know they're gonna cause problems </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> if I put them near other people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So we decided to do
something a little different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Without spoiling who sits next to who. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We had a fun time being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Who would get along with who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while not knowing each other too well?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we had a think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about what kinda
personalities would get on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so we didn't sit people next to each other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who they might be so familiar with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not too far away from just
being complete strangers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it was a fun time
just pairing people up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and pairing friendship groups up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just seeing the absolute
state of some of the tables </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we have planned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we've basically just put all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the fucking big
characters on one table. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And, yeah, it's gonna be a lot of fun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just to see if you guys get
along well with each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it's like, as you said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like two friendship
groups kinda merging </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I don't actually
have so much family </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> coming to my wedding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's actually a small
wedding in comparison </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to other weddings I've been to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, what do you
guys count as a small wedding? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - I don't know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> most of the weddings I've been to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> have been very much dominated by family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - Ours is 80% mates. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, that's good, then.
- Yeah, that's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh, that's good? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Small weddings or medium sized wedding </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> is different depending on
whatever culture you're from. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 100 people is, I'd say
a medium sized wedding, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's medium. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 100 people is tiny compared to
an Indian wedding, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was talking to a guy who
went to an Indian wedding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and they had 1,000 people
going or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a concert. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Indian weddings are
basically what happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if you actually go on your Facebook group </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you invite everyone
in your friend group. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - And everyone said yes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, and everyone said yes! </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And then they all get
to bring a plus one. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Part of the reason, because
we do have a massive family </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but we didn't want a
massive, massive wedding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause that's just such a headache </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so we were just like, "You know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're gonna have the
main wedding in the UK </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then we'll bring the
wedding to the family. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We'll go on tour, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We'll go on tour." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The wedding tour. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So yeah, we're having a
different reception thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for our family in the US
and Thailand way after- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That'll be nice, though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, way after the wedding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Go and hit up the globe, dude. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sorry? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Going hitting up all
the spots in the globe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mr. Worldwide. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mr. Worldwide here-
- Is going on tour. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> Wedding on tour. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Has to let the world know- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh, you only had one wedding? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Cringe, dude. Cringe. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, 'cause I don't know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I want to be able to talk
to everyone at my wedding </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and share the positive vibes, but- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Connor] Right, right, of course. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - When you get over to 100 or 150 people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which, it definitely would
have been our wedding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if we invited all of the family </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from both our sides from abroad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You get to a point where it's our wedding, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's meant to be our happiest moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you don't get time to
share it with the people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you want to share it to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You see everyone talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you, most of your interactions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are just, "Oh, you having a good time?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You have a five-minute
conversation and that's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's basically just like going
to a convention, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And going to a panel or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause that's the amount
of interaction I have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with people who line up
for a meetup or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- But I want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more of an interaction and more time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get to vibe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with people at my own
fucking wedding, I guess, so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't know people handle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> massive fucking weddings of
300, 500, whatever, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause I've been to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I went to my friend's
wedding, Japanese guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> who I went to university with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's a tradition, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know if it's a full on tradition </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but usually the tradition is
if you have a full-time job, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you already have a job- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You invite your colleagues. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You invite your colleagues
and you invite your bosses. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh yeah, the boss has to come as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - The boss has to go as well-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I went to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was soft segregation happening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was on the table </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of mates who I went to school with table </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but we realized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was one table out of
40 tables that were there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because there was probably
400 people at this wedding. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> All work colleagues, all
bosses and all family </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there was just me
and three school mates </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> who were there just being
like, "Yeah, so how you been? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> It's been a while. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know any of these other
people, but good wedding." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you have to line
up to give your blessing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> 'Cause I've been to some weddings </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where we have to do that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have to- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Line up to give your
blessing? What's that? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah because there is so many people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the wedding, right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> and the bride and groom
only have so much time- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Everyone takes a turn lining up in line? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I went to a Thai wedding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where we literally had to line up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be like, "Congratulations, guys." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And they had this stage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where they sat on a
fucking sofa or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I've only been to white
people weddings, so I don't... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - I literally had to line up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> to shake my mate's hand.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because after the
reception and everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> and during the food and stuff like that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and they're walking around and stuff, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> saying hello to everyone-
- That's cool. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Like- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Connor] It's a very
good system, though. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's a good system </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was also weird just lining up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> next to a bunch of salarymen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh yeah, I'm just here to
shake my mate's hand, you know." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Efficient, I like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I like the efficiency of it all. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh, you didn't see me at the wedding? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Shut up, we got five minutes
and a handshake, fuck off. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like an idol handshake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it is, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor grunting) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - How many of my albums did you buy? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I bought 10 of your CDs, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - You're just in the wedding like, ch, ch. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Camera Person] Asian weddings as well, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're lining up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes you can slip
some money to pass it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow.
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Camera Person] I got you. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - What, like a back alley deal? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if this
feels correct in saying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> but it just feels like the
Supreme store of weddings, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> Asian weddings are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like how much can you flex? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone brings in Supreme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone's like-
- Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, oh look at this spread, dude, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> way more food than you'd ever need. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bring everyone you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> Just so I can have the
capacity bigger on Facebook. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause a lot of Asian
weddings I've been to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a statement. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like a flight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's about sending a message. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is literally about sending a message. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Is it trying to tell people
how successful you are? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> Or it's like, what's the? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's more so about,
look at how happy we are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and this is the physical representation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of how happy and well off
we are for being happy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because the
amount of wedding politics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that go into an Asian, it is a thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It is a thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's not even about inviting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your immediate friends and family. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You got your parents'
immediate friends and family </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and people you grew up with
and everything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you are not invited
to an Asian wedding, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have fucked up in some way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - This legit sounds like the Red Wedding </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> from "Game of Thrones." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] It is! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - You failed to invite me to the wedding </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> thus you have betrayed my clan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - It is!
- You will die now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> You have insulted the House of Maneetapho, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> you will not be forgiven for this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is why I didn't want that side </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> just involved in my wedding. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's like a peace envoy. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> Fear not, there is another! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> The scroll comes down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We've gotta appease the family. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fear not, we are bringing
the wedding to you! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Burst open the doors. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is some "Game
of Thrones" shit, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, every
Asian wedding I've been to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is the most extra thing
I've ever seen in the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's unfortunate that it's
also extrapolated by the fact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that every Asian family I
know is fucking massive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's absolutely massive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You have to invite-
- Especially Southeast Asia. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Especially, oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I had my wedding in my, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd then have to invite all my cousins </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and all my-
- Cousin's colleagues. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just the entirety of
Bangkok, essentially. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - My cousin's colleagues. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The entire population of
Bangkok at Garnt's wedding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - So yeah, that's, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I definitely would not
have been able to plan that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> along with just being outside the country. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was like, "Fuck that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just gonna have a
small, manageable wedding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just enjoy it, right?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And just enjoy the wedding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Fuck yeah, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- That sounds nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm excited for it, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did you get an
overwhelming amount of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> in your Twitch chat </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> asking if we were going to Garnt's wedding </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or when Garnt's wedding was?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - As if they were also planning to go. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - They were like, "You're
gonna film it, right?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, "No, no." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Why? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I got that so many times. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> People were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "So this is a 'Trash
Taste' special, right?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like the wedding special. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, no! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Could you imagine if I just rocked up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> with a fucking camera </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> being like, all right, so challenge. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Joey fucking rocks up </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> with one of the fucking film cameras, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> just like, "Yeah, what's going on?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - We got fucking 10 different video crews </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just filming every angle of this wedding. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - GoPro on every corner of the room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Connor's got a GoPro on his
fucking forehead like POV. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - Pretty bad, four out
of five, tier list review </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> of all the free drinks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean-
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was actually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I barely took any pictures
at the wedding I attended. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because one, I just felt like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we have some pictures, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was more pictures to
share in between our mates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know, we might,
we'll probably share. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Me and Sydney will probably
share a few pictures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, you got a wedding
photographer, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, I don't know how much </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> we're gonna share to social
media yet, I don't know yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's kind of, I will decide- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Garnt will be wearing a suit </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and Sydney will be wearing a dress, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> that's kind of, spoiler alert. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And everyone will be nicely
dressed, that's about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not gonna be any different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> just 'cause we're YouTubers. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We're not like, whoa, wacky! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just, I don't know,
it's gonna be a wedding. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just a gold play button
in the middle, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - That'd be hid. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - Susan comes down, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yo, Garnt, dude, really
happy for "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> Really happy for you. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Susan comes and gives her blessing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We say our vows in front of Susan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's just one get out of
demonetization free card. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll take that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, just this once. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there have been other YouTubers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who have very much
documented their wedding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everyone's different
in terms of choosing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> how much they wish to share and
it's entirely up to everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you have to understand
that everyone's a bit different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in terms of how much they choose to share. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Because it is a very private event. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, you gotta respect the privacy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a wedding so the way I see about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that, I'm only gonna
get one wedding in my life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> so how much of this do I
want to share with the world? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How much of this do I want
to keep between myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and my close mates and family? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know yet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll think about it and we'll decide. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Content, content, content, content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah, 'cause the one- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You only get one
wedding, Garnt, come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause you always have
to battle the thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of you know that whatever you post, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's gonna get the most engagement- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah.
- Of course, of course! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That you're ever going to get- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If I post a video of this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know it's gonna get fucking
two, three million views, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Easy, easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's free content, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even have to,
I'm gonna do it anyway, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's just free content! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, "Honey, I know
this is a really personal thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but that click rate through, though." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's up, guys, I'm at the altar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> with the boys, about to say my vows. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Seven mid rolls on that shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Whoo! My God. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Might forward jump into that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And our sponsor for the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> Might be a good place to
actually put it, I don't know. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bro, imagine if we
fucking livestream that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Imagine the fucking Super Chats, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - IRL. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - VTubers could dream of
getting the Super Chats- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh my God.
- We would get </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> at the wedding, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Please, Garnt will not say his vows </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> until we get at least two grand. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> We are not moving from this spot... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, are you excited to go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> are you guys excited to
go to England, though? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> 'Cause-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's gonna be your second
time in England, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Second time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - First one didn't count. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> First one doesn't count.
- What do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - You barely saw anything. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you were there for how long? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't even remember. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Five days, I think? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Not even a week, I don't think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Take you to a good
Wetherspoons this time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you took me to-
- A shit one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Arguably one of the shittiest ones. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It was probably the
shittest Wetherspoons. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Take you to a good one. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - You still haven't taken me to fucking... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You still haven't given
me a Tesco meal deal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh, we'll do that too. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I thought maybe, should
I do a tier list video? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> I probably shouldn't say that on camera </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause then people will now expect it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I want to do a meal deal tier list. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey and Garnt] A meal deal tier list. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Of the optimum thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause someone, we spoke about. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Wait, did we speak
about it on the episode? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> No, no, we didn't.
- Not sure. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Can't remember. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Oh fuck it, I won't speak about it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Fuck, what am I gonna say now then? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Meal deal tier list. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'll do a meal deal tier list. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - How many meal deals are there? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Combination's are endless, Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Endless.
- Damn. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - There's quite a lot actually. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> And depending on which stores
you go to, different things. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So it's really-
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is that what the
wedding food's gonna be? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I love how Garnt's like,
my wedding, my wedding. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, yo, the meal deal combinations, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> though, it's gonna... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Let me show you about that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what's gonna be
at Garnt's wedding, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Garnt's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "You can choose any Tesco
meal deal you want, baby." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone else is gonna get
a nice, fancy five-course meal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and on Connor's desk, we're
just gonna give him a meal deal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Meal deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll be like, you're all
clowns, you're all clowns. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> This is worth five pound retail. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I got it for three pound 50. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Mic fell down, bro. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, yo, you get a meal deal, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I'm excited though, 'cause- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - We'll take you to Greggs as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yo, you gotta go Greggs.
- What's Greggs again? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pasties. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, the pasties place. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I gotta try this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I gotta try these pasties. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, like, 'cause we're
probably gonna be there- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Pasties, pasties. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A little longer now,
at least a week and a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I'm planning, hopefully </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> for Connor to take me to Wales. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, we'll see if we can do that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know if I can do that.
- We'll see if we can do that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - I told my parents, I was
like, yeah, maybe I'll see you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> Maybe.
- Yeah, maybe. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - We'll see, we'll see.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wales is fun though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause otherwise, let's be real, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm never gonna go to Wales otherwise. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Beautiful place. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - It'll be the only chance, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly.
- It'll be the only chance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Amazing hiking in Wales.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, 'cause you guys are gonna be there </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> and a lot of other people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are gonna be flying in as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it's gonna be really busy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I guess to the days leading up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and the even days that you fly in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, honestly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm hype, though.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm hype. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Should be good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's gonna be way more packed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than your last trip to England, I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I can't remember, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> why did you come to your
last trip to England? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't remember. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause Aki and I were already in Europe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because we went to a con in Finland </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we were just like, "Let's
just go on a Europe tour." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So and then, yeah, the
last stop was the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause we were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, I've never been
to the UK, weirdly," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though I have a lot
of mates who live there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was good though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Brighton was cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I liked Brighton.
- Brighton's a cool city. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like Brighton. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Mid, mid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We'll have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> lad's night out there.
- Mid city. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause Kevin's been fucking
messaging me every day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about how keen he is for a lad's night </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, "Okay, Kevin." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's always keen for a lad's night out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's always keen for a lad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Kevin, when aren't you
keen for a lad's night? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's be honest, Kevin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did you get to see a
lot of London last time? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> Because I don't know- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Not really. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, 'cause he was in
Brighton most of the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - You were in Brighton
for most of the time </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I don't know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> if you showed him any
of London, that's all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - London's hard to- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You took us to a bunch of the, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> well, I mean you, 'cause Aki's parents </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were there as well, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you took us to all of
the touristy places, I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> Luckily London is really
convenient for tourist stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where they put everything
really close together. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So you can smash it all out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know, with
London, it's kind of hard </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you don't drink. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - The only place I remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was you took us to the
"Harry Potter" place, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> the King's Cross, whatever it is. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, the Platform 9
3/4 where you run into it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so weird taking
people to King's Cross </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> because I just see it as a train station. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It is.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I think how people imagine it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just going to the "Harry Potter" land </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in Universal Studios or something, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Where you have fucking Diagon Alley, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they serve you whatever the beer is there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The butterbeer.
- Butterbeer or whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's not, it's just one- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Cart in the wall. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - One half cut out train trolley </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and a shop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then the rest of it is
just a fucking normal station. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's pretty busy, though. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is really busy.
- It's always busy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's always busy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Luckily, they put it out
of the way of the station </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so if you're gonna get a train, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you don't actually go near it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But there's a pub
behind it that sometimes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why I've been to it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's kind of annoying to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you've gotta get through all the tourists. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it "Harry Potter" themed at all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or is it just a regular pub? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's a normal
pub, it's a normal pub. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's just a normal pub. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Very normal pub.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a pub though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I do miss pubs, actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't wait to go to the pub again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's what I've been missing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> That's it, really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I will say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> England has definitely
upped up their bar game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> since I've been away.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, there's a lot more gaming bars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and themed bars as well.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anything's better than the
gaming bar you guys took me to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - I went to a better one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I was back last time and it was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> It's just, again, really expensive. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Really, really expensive. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, that's the price you pay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess, literally that's
the price you pay for the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We live in a society. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For the-
- What a price to pay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For the upscale of just themed bars </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I know we've
complained about it before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on "Trash Taste" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I remember this time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we also celebrated a birthday as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Sydney's maid of honor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I say maid of honor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because her maid of
honor is actually a guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He booked this very weird, not weird, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was a themed bar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it was basically a cowboy themed bar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's not just a themed bar, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> it was a whole experience. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It feels like I'm undermining it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just calling it a themed bar </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so you go in and it's like
you just woke up in the South, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Southern America during deep, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> when was the cowboy fucking years? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't remember. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - 1800s?
- Like 1800s? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Basically "Westworld." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's basically "Westworld." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's talking in a Southern accent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they have this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically it's like bring
your own booze, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And what they do is they take your booze, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever you choose to bring </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they will make
whatever drinks is suitable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with all of the booze that you brang. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you don't even buy alcohol there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get served alcohol there
based on what you bring </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you get taken in
and everyone's a cowboy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then suddenly a sheriff walks in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then there's this
whole fucking storyline </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, you know-
- I just wanna get drunk. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> They serve you fucking
moonshine down a back alley </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and all this stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's this entire
experience, entire storyline </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you get put into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is basically just a bar experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This sounds a like
Universal Studios ride. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It kind of is! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It kind of is except with- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Except they serve you booze. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Except with a lot of alcohol. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got, because-
- That's awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because you bring your own booze there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there's no limit or
there's no regulation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for what you have to bring there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You mix a lot of fucking drinks there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you end up getting very drunk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you wake up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're just seeing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a bunch of fucking
cowboys go at each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, "Where the fuck am I? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm in the middle of London right now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so fucking weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I gotta take you guys there, actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just sounds like a challenge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That sounds so strange. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To bring all your own booze, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then it's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I guarantee there's been instances </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where just someone just brings in bottles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of just nothing but hard liquor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Probably. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just puts it on the thing
and just be like, "Make it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just vodka, make me a drink. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What you gonna do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, there is a lot more choice now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in terms of just interesting
bars, bar experiences. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's definitely leveled up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, London seems to be changing a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is changing a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Brighton's changing a lot as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hardly even recognize the
city I grew up in anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just because it's become
this hip modern place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's gone to the point where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you go to some American
bars or some bars abroad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and you just think, yeah, man,
every bar needs its thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I went to this, I was
just perusing Brighton. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then there was just this
bar with a zip liner on it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or a zip line on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, that's the weirdest gimmick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've ever seen.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, fuck, I wanna go on it, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, a zip liner going out of the bar </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> or a zip liner going into the bar? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A zip line going out of the bar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So basically there is a bar
which just shows, in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> any gimmick can work if
there's a bar next to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I think what happened, right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is they built the zip
line on the sea front </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> and so there's a zip line, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so you can climb up and
you can zip line down and- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Sounds like a dangerous
combination with alcohol. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, you can see the
beach and everything. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then on the bottom of the
zip line, there's just a bar. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's just now the bar
with the zip line on it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So people literally just zip line </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> into the seat of the bar, just like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You start off in the bar </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and you can buy tickets
to go on the zip line </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just zip line down to the
opposite side of the beach </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like that.
- Jesus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that's the bar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's just the bar.
- Fair enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - To be fair, I would probably go on that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would probably do that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that sounds really fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just shows in the UK,
if you wanna come up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a concept for a bar, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just come up with a wacky concept. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Doesn't matter what it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Go karts.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With alcohol. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just put some-
- They serve you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> while you're on the go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just put some activity and alcohol </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and British people will come to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, that's yeah
fairly accurate, I'd say. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> Pretty spot on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so, so yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm excited for you to come, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm excited for you guys to
come back to London this time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because there is a lot more to do now, so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure we can plan
out a lot more fun things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for you to do, Joey.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't remember what
I showed you last time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I took you to Devil's Dyke, which is- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Which is still one of the
most questionably named places </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I've ever been to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's basically, it's just a hill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just a hill.
- It's a really nice hill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just laughing the entire way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when I found out what it
was called and I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they really didn't think that one through. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - English is a funny language. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - English is a very funny language. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was a nice place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was a nice drive.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's about it really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't remember. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you didn't stay
in the UK for that long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- I don't remember. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, we also drank at Brighton beach </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But other than that, that's about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - What have you been up to, Joey? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Since Garnt has been gone? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - A lot of stuff I can't talk about yet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I hung out with Nano the other day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah. I saw that.
- Oh, nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - She wanted to hang out
and we went to karaoke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and apparently she hasn't
gone to karaoke in 15 years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well that's her life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - She sings for a job. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I get it, but still, I
mean, it's unavoidable. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - She just goes to karaoke on stage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and in the studio, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then she sang, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then we got, we sang a bunch of songs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I was like, "Can
you sing one of your songs?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just jokingly.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause she has her songs on karaoke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I was like, "You have
to seize that opportunity." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And she's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "I've never sung my own
songs at karaoke before." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I thought that was gonna be a no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That was a nice way of her saying no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> She then proceeds to put
in literally every song. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You're like, "Oh, I got a concert." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Maybe- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I basically just got a free concert. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe no one asked her before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No one had the gall.
- Who asked? No one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - She's like, "I've been waiting
for someone to ask me this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> my entire life, Joey." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, the audacity of this guy to ask. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Nah, but she was really fucking cool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and we got to hang out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we're gonna hang out a lot more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Other than that, I've just been, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> every day I've just been hanging
out with someone different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nice.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's always fun though.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nice.
- Just going out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and yeah, it's been good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> It's being sociable
again after the pandemic </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> has been really nice. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right. No kidding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you had a chance
to hang out with Aki a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because there's a lot of
things we can't talk about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but one thing I will say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is that Joey didn't get to
see a lot of Aki last month. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I think I saw her-
- Like not at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - For a week, maybe, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> so she was like, "Yeah, let's
hang out a little more," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like, "Yeah, we
should probably do that." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's like a-
- I did, I did though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> We hung out a lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> We go on once a week dates </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just to nearby places
and hang out and stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and yeah, it's really good.
- Oh yeah? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've discovered a lot of Tokyo
in this past week, I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just because I've been going out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to all sorts of different places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with all sorts of different people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's like, there's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was in Shibuya just yesterday </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for my friend, Luke's birthday. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we went to all these new
places I'd never been before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We were in areas of
Shibuya where I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, this is"- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Shibuya's huge.
- "This exists." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, it's
got really cool bars. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's just so weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that Tokyo's just one of those places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where everything is just so tight knit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And kind of hidden </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that there are just entire areas of cities </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> you've probably never seen before. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And you're just like,
"Oh, oh, this place exists. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And this is kind of cool, yeah." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - My Google Maps is fucked </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause I've saved so many
restaurants and bars I liked. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> None of them mean anything now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because I don't know which one is which. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You literally have to fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, when I'm trying to remember a bar, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, there's no search function </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I'm literally, I'm like,
I think it was this area </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> and I'm just checking all
my hearts in that area </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I'm like, "Okay, great, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not a fucking,
it's great, I'm fucked." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> There's no way to categorize. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I've actually started doing that now </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I didn't do that before but because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when you go to so many different places </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're trying to recall
that one place in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Right, right, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the hardest fucking city </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause in most other cities, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can be like, "What is this bar?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And you type in the
description of the bar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, "Great, there's
only one bar in this area. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's five minutes away." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You type in the vague description in Tokyo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and seven different bars pop up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like, "It was
one of these, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even know if I'm
describing it right." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- You know? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's great 'cause when Emily
and Daidus just moved here, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, all right,
what food do you want? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I have a thing for that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, what kind of bar vibe do you want? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> All right, I've got three of each kind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, we're in this area? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, we'll go to this one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have a thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've saved everything so I've
got every kind of restaurant, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> every kind of vibe you'd want. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- So I've got a bunch. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So it's fantastic. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's become so extensive now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Okay, so you're going for a
specific vibe, specific food, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know eight places." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which one of these
eight places do you want? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, and then it's like, "All right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how expensive do you want?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, (indistinct), do you wanna be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> a five-minute walk from the station, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 10-minute walk from the station? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Okay, we're gonna go to
this bar afterwards though, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is that okay with you? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then it's like, all right, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> But I'm still trying to find more as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - So many places, I'll
never get to see them all. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Honestly, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even just in Shibuya, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> there's just so many places
to just eat or drink out </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that you could-
- Oh yeah, Shibuya's- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - You could go out every night to a bar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Somewhere different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> just in Shibuya and it'll
probably take you years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One thing I definitely noticed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going back to the UK
for two weeks that I did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> is that I've definitely taken for granted </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how easy it is to find somewhere
to stay out late in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ha ha ha ha, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've forgotten about
that in the UK 'cause- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It hits 12 and it's impossible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, it hits 12 and every
bar closes, every pub closes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so the only place that you
can vibely go to basically, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is a club. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And most of the time, I don't
wanna go clubbing, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna go to a club. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna continue the
conversation I'm having. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I've definitely
gotten used to in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you hit up the karaoke
or there's this one bar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's open till 4:00 a.m., </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or there's so many places open till late. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I've forgotten that
in the UK, it hits 12 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you try to Google where
the next place to go to is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And there's nothing,
there is just nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You just come out blank and
you're like, "Well, fuck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we gotta keep this going somehow, right?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And there's just no options
available, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, the UK sucks for that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I do remember that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every night at 12 it's
like, all right, fuck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> we have to really look to find a place. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just like someone
went to the power bank </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just went pew. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Everything just goes
down like an apocalypse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Well yeah, on Sundays
shops shut at 4:00 p.m. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - What? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> What, just supermarkets? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Or some places just don't even open. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I mean, I get the don't even open </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> but what's the point of
being open for five hours? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I think London has laws of on Sunday, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> a shop can only remain
open for X amount of hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they choose the busiest hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> from 10 til 4:00.
- Oh, I see. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't remember what
the exact hours were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I know at least, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> where I lived in London, it was that rule. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So all the shops shut and opened </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> at the same time on Sundays.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it's kind of
been like that right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> With it being Golden Week in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And when I was hanging out with Nano, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we were trying to find a lunch place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's either it's
closed during Golden Week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or it's got 200% capacity. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> If you come to Japan,
try and avoid this period </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause hotels and flights
and everything is doubled. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God, I saw
pictures of Haneda Airport- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh God.
- This week. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> It is a nightmare. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause it's
basically the only week off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that most working Japanese people have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they have a full week off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So they all travel,
they all go to hotels. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So yeah, try and avoid this
week if you come to Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it's rammed.
- It is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the week where every
manga chapter takes a week off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> That's how you know, that's how
I remember what Golden Week- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Is it actually that? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'Cause I remember growing up </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> and being like, "Man, 'Naruto,'
'One Piece,' and 'Bleach' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are taking a break on the same week? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's going on? What's going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to know what's happening, man." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's how manga readers tell the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're like, "Oh, 'Ode'
is taking a week off, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> must be Golden Week." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] True. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause it's not only
that bars close as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I forget, combinis are a thing here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so if you need access to alcohol </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're going round a
mate's house, whatever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you've always got the combini. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- But you wanna go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to a Tescos or a Sainsbury's or something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you better hope that you plan ahead </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you get it before 11, which is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some places close at 11 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's the latest some places close. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you pay double the price of alcohol </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you're at a corner
store that's shitty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they make all their money
from upcharging alcohol. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - But even, there are some
corner stores you go to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially in London
where you know, it's open, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but they don't serve alcohol past 12. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh.
- Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it's like, "Well, fuck, man." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You literally have no options, so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I discovered that the other day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was coming home late and
it was last train and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Oh man,
feeling a bit hungry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Might just pop over to a McDonald's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just do a quick little
Maccas run before I go." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was 1:00 a.m., right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the McDonald's are still open. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Oh, sick,
amazing. Let's go in." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I walk in and the
guy's like, "Drink only." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "Who the fuck
is walking into a McDonald's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to get a drink?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, look, I'll close
the sign for you, bro. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Let me close the sign. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, literally, why are you open? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Shut it down, dude, shut it down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, I could just go to a combini. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's so stupid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bro, who's going to a... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Who's going to a McDonald's being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "One Sprite, please"? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - At 1:00 a.m. as well, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - At 1:00 a.m., like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How much money are they
making from the drinks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> to warrant staying open only for drinks? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I thought it was a bit weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being like, oh, okay, it's still open </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but there's no one in here right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sus, dude.
- Now I know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sus.
- Man, you don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your target audience
if you're at 1:00 a.m. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're serving drinks only. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - There isn't a special drink </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that's only served at
McDonald's, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mate, there's only one reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to McDonald's at 1:00 a.m., </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's to smash a fucking- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's like, give
me a fucking burger. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna smash a burger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Smashing a burger or
ordering those 20 nugs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which you would never
order except at 1:00 a.m. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> at a McDonald's, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not here to smash an
orange juice at a McDonald's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> at 1:00 a.m., yeah? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I can do that anywhere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I always get the milk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - Milk? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I just get the milk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I only exclusively
drink McDonald's milk. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I go there for milk, that's it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Ronald's milk. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why do you go there for milk? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I used to order it,
though, it was all right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Tastes like shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why I- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - How do you fuck up milk? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I don't know, man, Ronald, man. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Ronald's secret sauce. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Ronald's fresh squeeze. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I haven't really been up to much either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've kinda just been working. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been to barbecue
a bunch, that was fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Barbecuing was chill.
- Nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - It was nice. It was raining though. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - How's the weather been here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, I guess I was gonna, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> literally you answered my question </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as I was processing what I was going say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - So this place I stayed at </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> had a place outside where
you could still barbecue </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> even if it was raining
'cause it was covered. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- So that was fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was, yeah, it was fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like barbecuing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a good time for
barbecuing right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause it's just just warming up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Weather was nice.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So that was chill. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Got to do that. That was fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just smelled of smoke for three days. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then we had a bonfire
and then it was very fun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause you just keep adding </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we had to chop our own wood as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That was fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, that's fun.
- Just camping vibes again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, it's very nice. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause we had- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you have an ax and everything? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - It was a hammer and there was a thing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where you put the log on </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like a metal thing like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh nice, nice.
- And you smack it into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Oh, cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Could just hear the, I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the dwarf for music from
"Lord of the Rings" in my head </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just while I was smacking away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just like bring me another log. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do do do do do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - As you were chopping and
your beard just extensively- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Should have put one of those lumberjack- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I should have, I was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Yeah, dude, this is what it's all about." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They're bringing my logs over like this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm like, "All in the fire we go." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - The red and black
checkered shirt, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was so fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why chopping wood was so fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Your hair just turns red. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I definitely- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, oh, I'm a ginger now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Definitely am a monkey, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just like smacking it was fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, dude, it's the best feeling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like there's just
something primal about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I just went to Costco before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and bought a bunch of
food and barbecued it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and I bought way too much food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause it was really hard to eat it all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it is Costco, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know, I know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was so much food, but
it was so fucking good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> It was so delicious. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Barbecuing, I love barbecuing.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - How long were you there for? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Three days, so pretty chill.
- Oh, nice. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pretty chill.
- That's nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was nice to relax, get away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- And just chill for a bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> before I guess I'm gonna go away again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's just 'cause this
next two, three weeks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are just all work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So, and then going back to the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Have a little bit of work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, like-
- Weddings and stuff. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm trying to pack as much as I can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> before I fly back to the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Right, right, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it's definitely,
I was like, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can work at home. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have a dedicated office
where I can work and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> if I need to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's just something
about being out of Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> My body's just like, "You
are in holiday mode now." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Why do you need to work? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> People are out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> People want to see you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm telling myself I'll be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll have a bit of time in
the UK to do some stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could probably just sneak it in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know though, the moment
I get there, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah, so, pub, pub?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - I wanna livestream </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but I just feel like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna be stream sniped
into oblivion in London. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I'm drinking at a pub, people- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - It could be fun though. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Trash Taste" is definitely, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's definitely changed
things for me in the UK </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I was about to ask, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how much were you recognized in the UK? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Compared to before? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't, like the fucking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at this wedding I went to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the bartender was a fan
of "Trash Taste," right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Mates rates, mates rates. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mates rates. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And fucking Sydney cajoled him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to giving him a free drink </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because she was like, "You recognize him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you don't recognize me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How dare you, how dare you!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Well, you're not fucking
Sydney's "Trash Taste," </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> what the fuck's she on about? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - She managed to get a free drink. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> She's literally been on the show one time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and she's like, "I'm the one
who was on 'Trash Taste.'" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you know who I am? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I am getting married to him, actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I am basically also "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - She was also very
intoxicated at this time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as we all were. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But no, but yeah, because
Brighton has become, I guess- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, it's a YouTuber city for the- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The influencer city. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't, sometimes I'll just
be sitting at my local pub </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I won't say but it is my local pub </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it is within the
vicinity in which I live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's very nerve-wracking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever I get recognized there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because one, it's weird to go
to the pub that you grew up in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that you always went
to and you grew up there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And now you go there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and sometimes, the odd person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just recognizes you from "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's always "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's all like-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's all "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So sometimes people recognize me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though I got the mask on
when I'm walking in Brighton. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's super super surreal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because obviously it's
the place I grew up in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And now it's become </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this really hip, happening
influencer city, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's basically the LA of UK
when it comes to YouTubers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, definitely, definitely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So there's actually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I got recognized
more in Brighton per se, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than I did in London </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause London's a bit more spread out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a bit more- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah, it's (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a bit more dispersed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I do get recognized the
odd place in London, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but definitely in Brighton, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's way more concentrated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Whenever I go to the city center, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's normally one or two people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that recognizes me from "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- That's cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Probably be the same
for you guys as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I blend in really well though. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> So. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can't quite say the same thing for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's gonna be interesting
because we haven't really, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> since "Trash Taste" started, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we haven't really had that yet, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause you know, the
borders have been closed here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> so not as many foreigners coming to Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, a little more recently I'd say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know if you've noticed, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> but the past month or
so I've been like, "Oh." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, I got recognized twice- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's a lot of white people around. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Twice in one day the other day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, really?
- Oh, nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've noticed there's
a lot more people now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whereabouts? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shinjuku. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well that makes sense.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So that was like, I was
like, "Whoa, that's weird." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is happening a lot more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> Because people are coming in now. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - They've made it a lot
easier to get in the country. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> At least my experience was. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This time I spent an hour
and a half in the airport </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> as opposed to four hours- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's good.
- Which was nice. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Which is nice. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's really nice. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The first thing I noticed </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> is that they removed
the fucking cattle tag </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they give everyone.
- Oh, thank God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I didn't feel like livestock, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which was a nice positive.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't imagine if you're
waiting for years to come in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on your work VISA. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Finally, the fucking country opens </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the first thing they do is
tag you like fucking cattle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Brand you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking brand you, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So, you know- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Welcome to Japan, tss. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thank God they've removed that system. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everything's just a
lot more streamlined now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I mean, it's a lot easier </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> traveling outside of the country as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, England, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't even-
- Thank God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Need to get tested </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or give a vaccine certificate or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> It's just back to normal, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Geez. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - God bless the queen, eh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> It's kinda crazy. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hopefully it lasts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause the one thing I'm
really fucking worried about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is while we're overseas,
say at Garnt's wedding, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and then they'll just,
discovered a new strain, guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Let's go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> You know? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Feel like even if they do,
people are gonna be like, "No." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well the one thing that I am, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if I'm looking forward to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or dreading is the next
convention we go to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause shit, we can't
announce what it is yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - We are going to a convention. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're going to several conventions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I remember what it was
like before "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't imagine what going to a convention </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is going to be like after "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, conflu was always a thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and now it's like conflu
on steroids is a thing now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, one thing we've
definitely had to plan around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we've never needed to
do before in conventions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is planning what we're doing
and the events we're going to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that technically, we
are now a fire hazard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- In some conventions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - At some conventions,
we are now a fire hazard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's something that I
never had to think about before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was people asking,
"Do you want security?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Oh, that feels so weird." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Do I really want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a guy just following me around? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But then I guess I don't wanna get hurt, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I mean, it feels weird, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, it does. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It definitely feels weird </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's definitely a
different kind of planning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than any of the conventions
I've been to before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I've always seen, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's been a couple of big guests </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at conventions I've been to, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That have security guards and security. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was just like, "Look at this guy." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Big dick on campus here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Look at this guy, oh the big
dick brigade coming through. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And now I'm about to be that guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I don't know how to feel about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I don't wanna be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Guys, I don't need all this extra shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Come on, guys, come on, guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just a guy, I'm just a guy." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But at the same time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially being back this time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like, I can't even
walk down my local street. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How's it gonna be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where all of the weebs
and all of the people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> that are interested in your content </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and your content field are
going to be concentrated </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in one place </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I'm just like, that's pretty scary </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> now that I think about it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I've never-
- It's pretty cool though. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I'm excited-
- It's gonna be cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I haven't seen it in a while. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm excited to see what it- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the last fan meetup
I had, I can't remember. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> There was a decent amount of
people that showed up to it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I don't even know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> if I can even a do a fan meetup this time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, I was talking to Alan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he was just like, "Yeah,
remember when you used to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> unofficial fan meetups?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I don't think
that's happening this time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I'm just like, "Yeah,
because it is a fire hazard." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Or that has to be taken into account </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when we do any kind of meetups now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> How are we gonna arrange
people who come to see us? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And are we blocking anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that could potentially be
a health and safety hazard? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It sucks though 'cause I miss- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Don't wanna piss off
the convention people. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - It sucks though </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I used to do those
kinds of casual fan meetups </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every now and then with
Aki and I miss that shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I miss that shit as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's 'cause it's so chill. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause it's like, you
know, you just tweet out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, "Hey, we're gonna
be here for a couple of hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you wanna hang out,
just come hang out." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's usually 50 people max </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's a sizeable amount </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be like, yeah, okay, you know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, this is-
- This is kinda chill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause you can talk to people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (speakers drown each other out) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can talk to everyone, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> you can have a conversation with people. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Interesting to hear
where people have come from </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and why they've come- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've met so many cool
people through that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and now it just sucks that, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a fire hazard now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now it's an Indian wedding. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - And now it's an Indian wedding. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - So now here's the stray, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you see me outside of the convention, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can talk to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - But that's like playing gotcha. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's luck. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (speakers drown each other out) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> You'll probably never see
me outside of a convention </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I don't leave my room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but maybe if you do, we
can talk a little bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> Unless I'm in a rush, then
I'll be like, "Sorry." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Because then it's always that instance </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of if someone recognizes you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in those kinds of outside
convention settings. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All it takes is for one person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like, "Oh my God, Connor!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> For everyone to just fucking
whip their heads around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and then a crowd gets forward. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Conventions when those crowds of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> normally wanna see what the crowd's about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - So, yeah, it's pretty bad. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I remember the worst I saw it before </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> was you at the Singaporean Convention </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> where it was like traveling
next to fucking Justin Bieber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We had this- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was pretty crazy, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We had panels to go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I remember it was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you could not take two
steps without being stopped. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- And- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was the first time
I had to get security. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was like-
- Did you get security? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had to because the
con was literally like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> "If you keep going, you're
gonna be a fire hazard." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And so I was like, "This is cool, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> but also really fucking weird." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, a fire hazard. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But just because you're
blocking walkways or something, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not like it's a big deal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but if you're- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not like someone's
there with a fucking match. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But 'cause people are stopping, right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so if you just stop in
a hallway or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's technically a fire hazard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and a lot of the venues can be punished </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> if it gets shown around
that that's happening. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, 10 people stop,
that's fine, that's manageable, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> 50 people stop, you're kind of- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not ideal, but- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - You're kind of getting
in the way of people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If 100, 200 people stop, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> then you are stopping the
flow of people walking about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're causing literal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I was gonna call it human traffic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But is there a word? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are human traffic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You are human trafficking right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what the
word is or the term is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's basically- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Human traffic jam. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A human traffic jam, I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - I went to a convention. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think you went to the same one. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> I won't name it just in
case they get annoyed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that apparent, one year </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they had Markiplier at the convention. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And apparently this
is the first convention </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that Markiplier ever did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was in the States.
- I know which con </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're talking about, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And they spoke about this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it was the zombie apocalypse, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Because apparently,
right, what happened was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is that, you know, I think
some, did Jacksepticeye go too? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - One of the years, I think, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - I remember it was a really
big, big fucking deal. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And the convention runners didn't, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> they knew YouTube and they
knew that it was a big deal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they didn't quite understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How big of a deal it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So they were woefully unprepared. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - For Markiplier's audience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And apparently they were
just like, it was insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- The security barriers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they didn't have anything really. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- And so, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> apparently it was stampedes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> People were just getting hurt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they had one security
guy for 1,000 people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when only 100 people should have turned up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they didn't plan, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they had, 'cause
they'd paid, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God knows amount of
money for that one extra </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in that one Marvel movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they were like,
"Well, he's the big deal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was in a Marvel movie." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's kinda like they
just didn't get it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And apparently it was
an absolute nightmare. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, they talked about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> as if it was a scene </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> ripped straight out of
"Dead Rising" or something. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Like "World
War Z" or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like "Dead Rising." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> It's just like.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It was insane, apparently. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Every single time
anything would come up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> they'd be like, "The event
that shall not be named." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause apparently it was such a disaster </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> trying to manage this, that they, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the convention, I think
that their reasoning was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that they banned him from coming back. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> And it was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> that sounds like it was
your problem, though. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, definitely.
- Interesting. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know, I can't remember exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - How dare you be too popular. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right.
- For our convention. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I think that's something like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it was really like they
fucked up massively </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> and not considered how. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I think it's events like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that have thankfully
made events and people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and not just events but
also influencers themselves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know, I know, I know, I
hate the word, I hate it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Show off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But people like us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - We are not the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're not like those other people! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, 'cause the
reason I talk about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like YouTubers or TikTokkers or whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that we came from, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we all came from the same place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we don't wanna feel
like we don't need security, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we don't need to worry about this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're like the man of
the people, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But at the same time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's been enough incidents
like the Markiplier thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Tanacon, like a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's been enough other influencers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who have set the precedent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be like things can go
really, really fucking wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you don't plan shit out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we know that you wanna
be seen as the casual person, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the same as everyone else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you do have a massive audience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's gotten to the point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where a lot of people need to think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about how did they manage
the audience they have IRL </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you see a number, you
see a number on your YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're just like,
"That's 10,000 people," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or, "That's 100,000 people,
it's just a number." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But when you translate that number, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if it's just a 10th of the number </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you see on your YouTube
channel to real life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that fills up a- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like a football stadium. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's what really sucks
about not going to a convention </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> at all recently is that we can't tell </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause you know, it would
slowly ramp up, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - We'd go to more convention. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I have no clue.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know what's gonna- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What our IRL situation is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause normally with how
"Trash Taste" has grown </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> over the past two years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Normally we'd get to ramp up
the experience to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> "Okay, guys, I think
we're reaching that point </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where we need to start
thinking about this, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> kind of start thinking about that." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But because it's just been two
years of us talking in Japan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we have no idea what it's going to be like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when we, I guess return
to the rest of the world </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and conventions and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> We're just playing a guessing
game a lot of the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in what we're gonna need and
how we're gonna manage it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Last time I went to AX, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I could easily walk through it all. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> And there was maybe, I
don't know, 50/50 chance </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that someone would recognize me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - And that was when I had what,
400,000 subs or something? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, and that was before
"Trash Taste," obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- So that's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what it's gonna be like now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, who knows? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, ah, dude.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Not excited for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well-
- I'm excited- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm excited but dreading. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like, oh God, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't wanna cause any
problems for anyone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like equal amounts- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - But I wanna meet everyone! </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I wanna say hi to you guys. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's equal amounts excitement,
equal amounts terrifying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Same here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm nervous in both ways. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm excited to go experience conventions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just go see the vibe
and everything again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm scared to see how things have changed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after last the two years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - More so mourning the loss </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of my weird convention
stories, probably now. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't get to stay in
random Discord Airbnbs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I met people online- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's not gonna happen anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That sucks.
- Sad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was fun, fun stories. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Weird moments in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He will reminisce as he
sits in his five-star hotel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm just like you, for real. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, he doesn't miss that, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Connor's just like, "Give me
the fucking five-star hotel." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Give me the Sheraton right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - No, it's fun but also
it's like God damn, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that was no way to live. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like damn, bitch,
you live like this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I got all my really stupid ideas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of my head and now I'm
trying to be more sensible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and take care of myself and yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's time to adult now. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> This episode is sponsored by Harry's. </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_01> - It's the only razor I trust </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> near my beautiful boyish young face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's become part

<SPEAKER_08> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, well I guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've literally got approval from Meilyne </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that we can announce actually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What are we announcing? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - One place that we're going </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is going to be Anime Expo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Aah! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - That should have been the obvious one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like us announcing
Anime Expo is just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> well of course, of course, that's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I also eat food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yes, I am an anime YouTuber. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - No one knew if it was
even happening this year. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I certainly
got fucking bombarded </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> by my Twitch chat being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You going to Anime Expo? Anime Expo?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - So if you're going to
AX, you can see us all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - (indistinct) staff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know what else. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - We got, hopefully, a bunch
of cool things planned. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can we announce, can we
announce the rest of the shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that we're doing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think-
- Not sure yet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We do have something special. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's some cool stuff happening, so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We do have, it's not just
gonna be us turning up at AX, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> we do have some cool stuff
planned for AX as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - So if you're going, we'll see you there. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> And if you see me around, say hi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> Buy me a drink and I'll- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Don't say that, you're gonna be like- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - 200 drinks deep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're gonna be intoxicated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm kidding, don't
do that, don't do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - What am I gonna do
with all these drinks? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Don't bring me a drink. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> If we're in a bar, then
you can buy me a drink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's gonna just be a
line to the SeaDog VA panel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just be like, here's a
drink, here's a drink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like an offering. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm gonna say this now </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause this always happens. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Please don't bring me food. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> It is an absolute nightmare </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to try and carry around with me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want food, don't bring me food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm also fat enough,
I don't need anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - If you do see me
outside of the convention, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> buy me drink as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> As long as I'm not carrying
five drinks at the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I might buy you a drink as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The only food I will accept, however, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is Flamin' Hot Cheetos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> You can bring me as many of those- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - No, no, no, no, no, no </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause everyone will
bring one, don't say that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that's exactly what I want. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, that's-
- Just give it to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a Joey thing.
- Just give it to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's a Joey thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bro, his hotel's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna be a fucking hot
Cheeto landfill, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's gonna- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm gonna just open the window </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and just throwing fucking
Cheetos to the crowd. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> You get some Cheetos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nah, I'm excited, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm really hyped.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - First time in, geez, when
was the last AX we went to? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Three years ago? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it was literally the
last convention I went to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - February, 'cause it was one of my, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's always one of my
favorite conventions to go to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I always get to meet everyone. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's not just a convention, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> it's basically just like, yeah, it's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - An AniTuber meetup. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is an AniTuber meetup. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - How the British people get
to see the American people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Pretty much, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - 'Cause we're all not American. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wonder how many people
are gonna go there this year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> in terms of-
- Yeah, don't know. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Other content creators
and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Call to action. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, if you're any
content creators going to AX, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> hit us up, whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - See you there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, big small- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Connor] Yeah, we'll be
in LA as well, so, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Let us know. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I wonder if we're gonna have
the annual AniTuber meetup. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause did you guys go to
that last year, last time? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't remember. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I did not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because there's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where was the last one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Not the one at the bowling alley. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was one at a bowling alley? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Camera Person] Oh
no, that's Funimation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Funimation Party. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - You wanna explain what this is? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Huh? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You wanna explain what this is? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so every, when did it even start? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even remember when it started. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it was five, six
years ago or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but as long as I've been to AX, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's always been one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but there there's always been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this unofficial AniTuber meetup thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where basically it used to just be done </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> outside of the convention hall, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in that open area where
all the cosplays are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just like, it doesn't
matter how big or small </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of an AniTuber you are, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you can just come to this
event, kinda meet everyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially five, six years ago, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the AniTuber community was
so fucking small, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So there'd be 30 people, max. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The last one I went to, though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was 100 people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, oh, it's getting big now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's getting big now.
- Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think 'cause that one was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> people were asking for invites </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then people were asking
them for invites, and- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then there were people there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> who definitely weren't
making YouTube videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There were people just showing up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - And they were just showing up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause they knew Gigguk would be there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So it was like, I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, I don't know
how it's gonna work nowadays </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's normally one
AniTuber or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> who has just rented out a house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And that's just now become
the unofficial AniTube meetup. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, they just rent out a house </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and they just invite a
bunch of people, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that one was chill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That one was awesome. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I enjoyed that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But yeah, the last time we did
one outside of the convention </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> was five years ago, I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And there was maybe 50, 60 people there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Obviously way too many
people to actually meet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and get to know personally, but yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I miss those. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I met a lot of really cool
AniTubers at that event. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I met John for the first time,
Super Eyepatch Wolf there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Love seeing John.
- The first time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Love hanging out with John. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - He was the crowd favorite that year </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because he'd never been to a convention </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and never shown his face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So everyone was like
"Yo, Super Eyepatch Wolf! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's go, dude!"
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Amazing.
- Also, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> absolutely chill dude, as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Absolute chill dude, absolute Chad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> He's the mega Chad of AniTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> In terms of looks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Man's got a fucking
jawline and a half, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Dude, I'm hype, man, I'm really excited </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to go to conventions. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think not being able to see
the viewers for a long time </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> has made my brain go too YouTuber-y. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got YouTube brain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> What's YouTube brain? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's all numbers for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's all numbers to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't mean anything to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I haven't seen anyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just data.
- I haven't left my house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just stay in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Even more isolated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just wanna be drinking at a bar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then someone strikes
up a conversation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being like, "Oh, I love your stuff." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we just have a nice,
chill conversation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's some of my
favorite fan interactions, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because as much as I wanna have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the longer conversations
with people come to meetups, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like, yeah, you're in
like Indian wedding head space </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's just like, you have a, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you're lucky, a few
minutes with everyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but when you're just chilling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that random guy
recognizes you or random girl, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just having a nice conversation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're just like, "Ah,
I remember why I started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what I'm doing right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's for moments like this, man." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I weirdly have a lot of
those though in Japan, I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because you don't get recognized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as often in Japan,
especially nowadays, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So the one person who does
find you on the street, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> you actually, as long as
you are not in a rush, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you actually have, at least me, anyway, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have at least a three or
four-minute conversation </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> being like, "Oh, you know,
what are you doing here?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> All that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And those are the best. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Those are the best. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, in Japan, it's different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because right now, no one
here is a tourist, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So everyone here is doing something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or has an interesting story, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> or is working here or
something like that, and- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Lots of students now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Lots of students. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now there is lots of students now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know, 'cause when did they start </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> letting people in again? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - A month ago?
- Like, a month ago? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I've noticed there's loads more- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - I mean, I've barely been
in Japan for the last month. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> How's it been for you guys? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I did a stream recently
and I got stream sniped </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot more than last time.
- Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I think that was interesting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It was fun, though. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's definitely gone to
the point now where, again, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> I've just noticed, there's
a lot more foreigners now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I just remembered, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's just a lot more students now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then obviously, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have more of a
chance to get recognized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was in butt fuck middle
of nowhere the other week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> outside of Tokyo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And there was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two random dudes who just recognized me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was just like,
in my head, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "This is weird." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But then I was like, "No, this
is what it used to be like." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - So now it's just this weird whiplash </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> of being like, "Oh, fuck, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're slowly going back to
normal, finally, hopefully." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The world is healing.
- It is truly healing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hopefully-
- Shit is healing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Rage. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 'cause your plan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is to go back to Australia
this year as well, aren't you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna go see my family </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the first time in three years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I mean, the trip
to the UK for your wedding </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is the first time I'm gonna be overseas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in three years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Deported, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I know, it's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, 'cause the last time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you attempted to go overseas, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you got deported, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got deported. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt cackling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And you've been waiting
three years since then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like PTSD now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The last time I went on
an international flight, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I got deported, so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's a cool story. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is a cool story. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a cool story to tell the kids </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but, yeah, yeah, I'm going
down to see my family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and mates and stuff like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so that's gonna be very weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just seeing the city I
grew up in completely change </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause my sister was saying that, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's completely changed
in the past three years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, this is gonna be weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was very weird going
back to my home city </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> and just seeing it
completely changed as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And even just seeing
London slightly changed- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Well, the skyline of London, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> there's loads more skyscrapers now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was two and now
there's tons more being built. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wonder how it managed to
not get them for so long then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> It's pretty strange. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - But now I'm gonna be so
scared of what you experienced </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> of just being at a place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's very local and familiar to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I go to my local mall, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just gonna be like, "No
one recognize me, please." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Not here, don't follow me home, please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> That's what I was worried about, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Be like, "Come in my
house for some tea." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Meet my parents. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Have some crumpets and
biscuits, come on, come on. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, London's become very bougie. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I called an Uber, it was
my first Uber in London- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh wow.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And a fucking Tesla shows up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was just like,
this is an Uber, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just called an Uber. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, a fucking Tesla shows up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'd never ridden in
a Tesla before, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you guys ever ridden in a Tesla? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I haven't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so I didn't know how they worked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because the first thing you normally go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you go to a car </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is you go and you pull the handle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Right, so I go up to this Tesla </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's no handle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's literally a flat handle place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I didn't know you
were meant to push it in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the handle comes out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "Daddy Elon has designed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> some fucking futuristic
travel to Mars fucking stuff." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's probably electric </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I'm standing there
in front of the Tesla </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking it's an automatic door going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm like, uh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Connor] Did he have to open it for you? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, he had to come out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and just tell me just
to push the handle in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just imagine Garnt
just being like, "Open! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Open!"
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Daddy Elon, please. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Uh! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was it fun though? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Riding in a Tesla? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was very fun.
- Yeah? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was-
- It's a toy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Huh?
- It's like a toy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it's so futuristic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is, it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm excited.
- It's cool though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was weird
seeing the pad at the front </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just completely track
everyone, all the cars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but when it came to pedestrians, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just fucking freaking the fuck out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because there's so many
pedestrians in London. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Oh, in London, yeah, true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So just seeing humans
appear then disappear, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then this dog was a human then it wasn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> But it was very cool. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> It is very much a toy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know our mates' parents
owns one as well and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Connor] Yeah, never shuts up about it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Huh? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Never shuts up about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, never shuts up about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He drives it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's like, "Oh, my
mum bought it, though." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He doesn't mention that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> He says, "My Tesla." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Our Tesla. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Our Tesla. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause he took you on plenty of- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, I went in his Tesla. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah, I got shit in the car. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I tell you about that? Remember that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I almost shit in the car, remember? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Have we told that on- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - No, I haven't. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have we talked about
that on "Trash Taste"? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - No.
- We haven't. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - So we were driving in this
Tesla in the countryside </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> and the Tesla, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it had been sitting there all day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had the window down.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - (chuckles) And I can't
remember exactly what happened, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but we were driving along
this really country road </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then, oh no, I remember what happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're driving along this country road. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's kind of dirt road. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not the cleanest road, we're going. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then he's trying to show
off that it can go 0 to 60 in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, as every car owner does, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they have to prove that the car's fast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - As if normal cars don't go fast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we're going fast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> And as he speeds up, there's a, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know if it's a harvester </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> or something plowing
the fields next to us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> No, it's the machine that spreads manure. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, okay, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - So as it's spreading it, we're going by </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> and then before I know it-
- Oh no! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm chilling like this in the car </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> and then suddenly just
a fucking wave of manure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> starts hitting my face
and goes in the car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's launched into this Tesla. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> And then everyone is doing
that thing of kind of like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> aah, aah, aah, aah, oh God, oh God! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Aah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> And then there's just shit
everywhere in his Tesla </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and he just got it cleaned a week before. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's white seats as well- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's white seats.
- Pure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's white seat Tesla.
- Oh no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - And the inside is pure white. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> Absolutely dickhead white.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - You should never have
your interior this color </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for this reason </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and so there's just, oh God. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And the entire car journey,
it just smells of cow shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It just absolutely reeks of cow shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's freaking out cause
it's his parents' Tesla </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's borrowing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And so he's like, (spluttering). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh, what am I gonna do? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> He's freaking out. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm like, "Don't worry,
we'll get it cleaned, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> we'll get it cleaned." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> He's like, "Oh my God, my
parents are gonna kill me." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so we- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - So anyway, about that 0 to 60. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And there's chunks this
big of manure in the car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's just, and then
the smell is just everywhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] My God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So we go into a Pizza Express afterwards </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we just stink of shit
and we're just eating pizza. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> And then I think he goes to get it- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - They must have been so confused </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> because the people working there's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just a bunch of dudes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just smelling like shit eating pizza </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're like, "Oh, man,
they fucking live like this?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Meanwhile, they head
back into their Tesla. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - It was so-
- Like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was so, and then I think
he got it cleaned the next day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or the day after 'cause he was so angry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like, "I have to get it cleaned, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I have to get it cleaned." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So he got it cleaned. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause I remember him building up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that he's like, "Oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my parents let me borrow the Tesla. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Guys, I'm driving the Tesla,
I'm driving the Tesla." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was just this massive
event in our friend group </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that Eugene's coming in a fucking Tesla. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Damn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Day after, Connor's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Guys, I got shit in Eugene's Tesla." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - We were going a country road, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm the kinda guy, I don't know why, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know why people wanna do this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> but I just wanna put my arm like this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, of course, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I get that.
- I don't know why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] I get that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And so yeah, then obviously
I couldn't have predicted </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that a bunch of manure
was gonna fly in the car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it did.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a funny story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember just feeling bad for Eugene, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but also laughing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was very funny.
- Laughing very, very hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - I was covered in shit, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was so funny at his anger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that his Tesla was covered in shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it canceled out me
being covered in shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] It was worth it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wasn't too bothered
about being covered in shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it wasn't like I was going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to a formal dinner or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was going to Pizza Express
and I'm gonna get drunk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Whatever, fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll just clean it,
I'll clean the clothes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not the end of the world." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- That's so funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But yeah, it was good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I also, recently I
watched, yesterday in fact, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this is good timing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I watched the new "Doctor Strange" movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, how was that?
- Oh, how is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Very mid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- Is it actually? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was probably one of
the most boring movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I've watched in the long time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- Oh wow, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I heard-
- Damn- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - A lot of good things about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sad, I was really excited for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Watch it, make your own mind up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I also watched it in Dolby Atmos </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I was way too close to the front </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I really regret it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause some of that fucking sound effects. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - There's this one sound
effect in the start </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> where he summons a saw and I swear to God, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it nearly punctured my
ear, this saw sword. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, no, it was weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was all over the place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The thing that I don't like
about "Doctor Strange," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't know if
anyone else feels this way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> is that I don't know what
the fuck his powers are. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's just whatever he needs to do. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just like, he's like, oh, ta-da- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Garnt] He does the circle thing, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I do a circle, then
now I summon a monster </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> and now I summon a boat and it's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know what fuck
the your abilities are. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> No one has ever taught, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> there is never a scene where
he's learning these powers. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Individual spells. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> How does this work? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've always just said his power </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> is like the Metronome move in Pokemon, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where it's just like, he
just waggles his fingers. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> And then something happens, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's like, I don't know
what the fuck is going on. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> And the entire movie feels
like when you're kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're eight years old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you pretend like
you have a magic fight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with your childhood friend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, "And I summon this,
I do this, I do this back!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> That's what the whole movie felt like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Isn't that just a JoJo fight? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - But at least JoJo,
there's some tense to it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's some intensity. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This entire fight was like, all right, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> well of course he's gonna win. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then there's just this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there's just like, what
the fuck is this movie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know what fuck the is going on. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's so stupid. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This entire movie was just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> all right, now this, all right, now this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> And now this! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> And it's like, "What is happening?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah I heard from comic book fans </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> that Doctor Strange is meant to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the most powerful beings
in the Avengers or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they've just completely
nerfed him in the MCU </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I have no idea what
the fuck his ability is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> apart from just summoning the circle thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and summoning the teleport. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Basically, it's just Paul, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> He just has the Paul guy. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe the character in
the comics is interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was so fucking bored in this movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then halfway through they, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's the multiverse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they introduce
other Marvel characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from other Marvel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it's supposed to be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess just comic book boner moments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I'm just supposed
to be impressed that- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They included that scene! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - That a guy from the X-Men turned up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I'm like, "I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm not impressed by this." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's just a moment where he'll come in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the music will play, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the stereotypical, oh, it's a character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're supposed to know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dun, dun! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it's like, all right, cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now, and then he's dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> And then it's like all right, okay, cool. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Okay, fair. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> What is happening, dude? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, is it because you
just haven't watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> many MCU movies since? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I've watched a lot of them,
I've watched a lot of them </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and this was, the only one I
haven't watched was "Eternals" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause I heard it was complete doo doo. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And "Captain Marvel," I didn't watch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause I heard it was really bad. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - This is probably one of
the worst ones I've watched. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you've watched every Marvel movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> post "Endgame" as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Post "Endgame," what has that been? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Just "No Way Home." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's been "No Way Home," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's been "Black Widow"- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I've watched "Black
Widow," that was God awful. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Camera Person] (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (speakers drown each other out) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - They've been taking big Ls, I feel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> These movies have been... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just feel like they
are still building up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - "No Way Home" was really good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - "No Way home" was fucking great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - But that was 'cause I got
what I wanted outta that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- I was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah, I kind of expected to see, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's part of that movie, and yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I'm sad because I'm not that hyped </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for any new Marvel movies coming out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And "Doctor Strange" was one of the few </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was actually hyped about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was really hyped about "No
Way Home" and that met my- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] That was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That met my expectations. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, okay, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh, he's already here? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I just felt that it was like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You know when you watch a movie </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I wanted to watch
it to give my thoughts. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> But at the same time, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fuck, I didn't wanna give them money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they think that I want more of this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- 'Cause I don't want more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of this.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd rather, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I heard "Morbius" was really, really bad. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've heard that's the worst Marvel movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of anything Marvel related of all time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's not Marvel is it? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's Sony. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, that's not MCU. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it's not exactly MCU </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but obviously Jared Leto
is apparently really bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know, maybe watch
it and give me your thoughts </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I'm really torn on it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause there were some moments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I thought was really interesting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I thought, okay, this is good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the rest of the time, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this just felt like a
movie they wanted to make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just because they were like, well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess we could get Benedict
Cumberbatch to act himself out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through times and that could be fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's just like, all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> And I don't know, it was just
really long winded and boring. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> And the moment my popcorn ran
out, I was kind of out of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kinda done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was kinda like, I was like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was the final straw. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, well, there's no
reason for me to be here now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I went with Emily and Daidus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were just laughing
all the time as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at some of the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> some of the dialogue was so bad. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Did they enjoy it? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - They thought it was really bad as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - So they were enjoying
it ironically, I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, there were some lines of dialogue </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that it was just like, "Who wrote this?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> This was completely absurd. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> This is like a four-year-old wrote it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, maybe
viewers, maybe I'm wrong, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe you disagree with me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let me know what you think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I haven't looked at any
critical reviews of it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I don't know critics are saying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> but I would give it a four- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the 10 out 10 masterpiece! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - For me, it's a four out of 10. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I was very bored. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it the worst Marvel
movie you've seen? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - What's the worst one you've seen? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - "Thor 2" was pretty bad. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that was pretty bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That just sounds bad from the name. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Connor] "Thor 2" is pretty boring. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm looking forward to the new "Thor." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, just seems fun. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That seems fun.
- "Thor 3." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, "Thor 4." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Thor 4"! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, "Thor 4." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Four! </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I don't know.
- "Thor 4." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Thor 4." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you have Marvel movie fatigue? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like-
- I don't know- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just make "Blade" and
make it good (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I definitely have Marvel movie fatigue </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> in the sense where I'm just watching it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just to keep up and there are few- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I had Marvel movie fatigue </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> after "Iron Man 2." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I just feel like they're
fumbling right now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> They're like, "What are these movies? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> What are they making?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know what the fuck
they're trying to sell out. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I don't think they're fumbling, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I just think once you end with "Endgame" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's just an end
of 10 years of buildup, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like, well, fuck, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how long is it gonna take
to build up something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's going to be as exciting? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not even invested in
the characters as much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> that I was fucking Iron
Man or Captain America </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or the main guys in the
previous generations. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So it's like, who's going
to be that main guy? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I thought it was
gonna be Doctor Strange. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I thought that was a possibility. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Probably will be.
- Possibility, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just a resident sleeper, dude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that entire... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I kinda shut off for the first hour. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I was really bored.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Watching "Shang-Chi" was cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm just like, I'm
watching a (indistinct) movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're barely relating this
to the MCU somehow, whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not really, I don't
really care about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm here for the cool fights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was watching YourMovieSucks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was doing his review
of all the films of the year- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And 70% of them, he was
like, "I didn't finish, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it was shit."
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then a lot of people got angry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they were like, "Oh,
how can you review a film </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you didn't finish it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I was like, I mean, surely
if you can't finish a film </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> that says-
- That says something. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - More than anything. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like how critical
do you want to be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's more like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, you can say you really
didn't fucking like a movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and not finish it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I've done that plenty
of times with anime, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if you want me to
properly critique it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then there's only so much I can critique </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without seeing all of it
because I didn't see all of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a nuanced argument, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think you should very
much be allowed to say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, I thought something sucked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> because I didn't finish it." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, yeah.
- You know? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly.
- I know, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I feel like if I was watching
that many movies as well, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I wouldn't be- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you gotta start using
your time wisely, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> You don't wanna waste
your time on something </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> that you think is just gonna be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> your opinion's not gonna change on it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> regardless of if you finish it or not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what the best TV show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that I've watched that came out recently? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - "Severance." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, dude.
- I watched that too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Dude.
- What the fuck. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, oh my God. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'Cause I was gonna talk
about some good shit </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that I've watched recently. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - "Severance" is probably
one the most interesting </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> and best TV shows I've
watched in a long time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sell it to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I'm gonna do a bad version, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then Garnt can do the good version. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The plot of this world </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is that there is a
procedure that you can get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that'll split your mind into two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you have two consciousness, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> one that goes to work and one
that does everything not work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So essentially there'll
be two characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the same body. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And they don't have any
memories of the other. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Oh, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So the person in work
only existence is work </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they don't know anything else. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And the person outside of
work only has outside of work </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and doesn't know anything else. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so it's kind of really interesting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause it's dealing with, all right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well, if you only worked all the time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you would probably get miserable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and want to not work all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So then they're trying to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's really interesting side plots </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of when they're trying to figure out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what their outside person is doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then the outside
person's trying to figure out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what the inside person's doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the company they work
at is really mysterious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We don't really know what they do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so it's kind of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's very, very creepy and- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's pretty interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You should watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - So what's the good version? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was actually pretty good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You did it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Try and sell extra, fluff it up. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'll do the bad version, I guess. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Imagine "Black Mirror" was good again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - But they had a good
premise and they ran with it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause I watched the season </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and it felt very "Black Mirror"-esque </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but when "Black Mirror"
had very interesting ideas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and wasn't just fucking just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Miley Cyrus, Hannah Montana. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Going to the bottom of the barrel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> being like, yeah, we can make
a fucking episode about this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> But it has a very interesting
concept, as Connor just said. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they run with it and they
explore every single facet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that I wanted to explore out of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They definitely bring out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the ethical aspect about it as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of just, is, if you
separate your memories, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that person essentially a new person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or is it just still you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause in a certain argument, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they are both the same person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you come from
the same personality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just don't share
the memories of working </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the life outside of work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But if you separate the memories, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> does that mean that's two separate people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that are living in one body as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Chris really liked it too. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And Chris, funnily enough, watched it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's on Apple TV though, which- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, if Chris watched it,
it must be a masterpiece. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Chris really liked it too. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone I know who's watched it- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, that sounds really cool, though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Literally, everyone
I know who watched it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> really enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - That definitely sounds
like a show I would like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, and no one's talking about it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause it's on Apple TV. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - The only reason that
I was able to watch it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> was because we were luckily
provided iPads by GeeXPlus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right, right.
- To use for work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, great, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have a device to watch it on now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Perfect, 'cause I couldn't do that before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh cool. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I pretty much just saw an
article where they were like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> "Apple TV has some really
interesting shows," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it came up and I thought,
wow, that looks really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- And then the reviews </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> were insane.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I thought, wow, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, honestly I really hope </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it doesn't mess up the landing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause season one was really, really good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Season one is really,
really good and holy fuck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> did they end-
- That cliffhanger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - On a cliffhanger.
- Oh boy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - God fucking dammit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, but that's also scary, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause people were saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the same thing about
"Black Mirror" as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They were like, "Damn, season one, though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Hope they stick the landing." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I think "Black Mirror's" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically not gonna continue </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's in legal
battles for ownership. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really?
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's in legal trouble. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think when they sold their rights, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something was iffy and there's arguments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> over who owns the rights
to "Black Mirror." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So I think pretty much,
"Black Mirror's" dead. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Damn.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I think. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, that doesn't sadden me too much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> because they were definitely- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Running out of ideas. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - They were definitely
running out of ideas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Something scratched that itch though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was the show, so I'm glad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm glad we got something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, that's good.
- (indistinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> with "Black Mirror," I remember
season one and season two </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> being fucking incredible.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then season three was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, there are some really good episodes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then some are just
really weird episodes." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And then season four onwards </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was just, why are you
putting Miley Cyrus in this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't even get to that point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And season five was even worse, Jesus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - I didn't even watch season five, no. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - It sucked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, so I mean,
there's only so many ideas </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> you can come up with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with it being an anthology
of different ideas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but "Severance," fucking great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's just one idea
just explored to the fullest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> Very happy. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Such good acting as well.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The acting is so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> All these characters are so creepy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- And believable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so cool.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it was perfectly casted, as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Definitely check it out </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> before it gets too hype. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then you won't watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, then I won't watch it, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> If another person starts talking about it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd be like, no, I don't wanna- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Currently, no one is talking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I literally don't know
anyone who's talking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I never see anyone talk about it so, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> If you want a really interesting TV show- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - I gotta watch it before
this episode goes live </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> in a couple of days. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guarantee, if you watch
one episode, you'll be hooked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's one of those shows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where it starts so strong
and it's really interesting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sure, sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, watch it if you can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's really interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Actually, yeah, amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Amazing show.
- Cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Speaking about something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that everyone seems to
be talking about now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I hang out with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Spy x Family." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking "Spy Family."
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't know how
big it had gotten here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> In the UK, even people
who barely watch anime, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they're like, "Yo, you
watching "Spy Family"? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Really?
- Or "Spy x Family"? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Oh my God."
- Fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Everyone-
- I pronounce the x </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause I'm a chad. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's pronounced
Spike's family, actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing)
- Spike's family. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I mean, it's been a while </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> since I've just seen an anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just blow up this
quickly, I guess, 'cause- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, right from the get
go, it was fucking solid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - I mean, the manga was
insanely popular in Japan. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - I think it was- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - But I remember I was so scared </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I've been a fan
of the manga for ages now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and when I was about to
watch the first episode, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, please, please let it be good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Please don't fuck this up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And thank God they didn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- But I wasn't expecting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, as you're saying,
I was not expecting it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to be the talk of the town, essentially. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause I expected, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I just feel like holy fuck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Shonen Jump are just on a
different level right now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in terms of making mega hitters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it feels like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> it feels like when Shonen
Jump release new anime, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's like Shonen Jump, and
then every other anime. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - True.
- Pretty much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause it doesn't even feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you're talking to a anime fan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> if they say they watch Shonen Jump stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because everyone's
watching Shonen Jump stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Imagine if we got a
good "Berserk" adaptation. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Just imagine. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> But even so, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> I even don't think it would be
as popular as "Spy x Family" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or "Demon Slayer" or something like that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think the only IP </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> that can really stand
up to Shonen Jump IPs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is "Attack on Titan."
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And that's the outlier, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is just a
different Shonen magazine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Final season part one deluxe edition. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but I mean, it's just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I haven't read the
manga of "Spy x Family," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just a really, really good show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I haven't watched it
yet, I've been saving it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause I wanna binge it all
for one big serotonin boost. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's really solid.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Even from a manga read, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> it's really, really
solid adaptation, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's nothing I
can really say about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> other than it's just a
good show from a good manga </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a fucking amazing adaptation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They nailed Anya. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> As a character- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're gonna be seeing
reaction images of her </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> for the next four months, at least. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know, right, I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> She's so-
- Every Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, she's so fucking adorable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - She will single handedly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> save Japan's fucking
aging population, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Depression been mad
quiet since Anya came out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Japanese population that
aren't having enough babies, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> one Anya.
- You can have this! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You can have this right now! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is all you can have, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is what you're missing out on! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, 'cause that was the
only thing I was worried about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was because the dialogue </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is what made "Spy Family"
so fucking good in the manga </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if they nail the voice
acting and the casting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> this is gonna be huge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they fucking nailed the casting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At least, especially the Japanese one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> The voice for Anya is perfect. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think the big thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that really makes it stand out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is the cast really nailed the chemistry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> between the mum, dad, and the daughter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously Anya gets all the spotlight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but just the dynamic, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seeing the dynamic play out between, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> if you don't know the
premise of "Spy x Family," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a family that has a
spy in it and assassin in it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and Anya who is a kid- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can read minds.
- Mind reader, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That has telepathy, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a really, really weird mix of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they nail this
family dynamic perfectly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I remember just
it's equal parts funny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and wholesome as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember seeing- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like an (indistinct)
that's actually funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Little bit of everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Little bit of everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - A little bit of everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - A little sprinkle of everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, a little bit of everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I remember coming back
from the wedding last weekend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I remember, oh, the newest episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of "Spy x Family" just came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I watched it and I just thought, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was already high up on positive vibes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and "Spy x Family" gave
me such wholesome vibes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I almost fucking cried </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just 'cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just 'cause of how
fucking happy I felt, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I love how you're just
like, "Fuck the wedding, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> a new 'Spy Family' episode
just came out, dog." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's where my happiness is right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Real shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's the real shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never thought I could
burst full of wholesomeness- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt's at the altar like this, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh shit, oh fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, yeah happy for you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, Anya. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I'm just like,
"Hold on Sydney, hold on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Before you say your vows,
all right, I'm ready now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm ready, I'm ready." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Opens his wallet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just a picture of Anya. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, that's what I'm fighting for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Real shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's what I'm fighting for right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you watching the
anime of "Spy x Family" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> or are you just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, I am actually watching it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because, yeah, I watched the first episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like, "Oh shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is actually a fucking
amazing adaptation." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> So, yeah, I am watching it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not caught up to the
latest latest episode, but. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm watching it kind
of on and off and yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's fucking great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can see why people are hyped about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But, you know, you were saying that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh yeah, Anya's the new favorite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've seen a lot of fucking Yor- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I have, I have, I have. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pictures and it's like oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know which character
you're talking about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even know what their name is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You said the name, but-
- Yor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm guessing it's the woman, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm like oh my God, first
time in God knows how many years </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> where waifu of the season
is not a high schooler. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So thank God.
- Yeah, I know, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well done.
- It's a mother, it's a MILF. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a mother.
- It's a MILF. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's actually a MILF, thank you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well done, guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I guess I'll have to check it out. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, I mean, it's so weird </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just 'cause obviously I
expect it to be popular. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't expect it to be
this popular this quickly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Even "Demon Slayer" took 18 episodes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - To really burst in popularity. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Spy Family" just literally took two. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Be good to see if it sticks
around for the entire run. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it will. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would be very surprised
if it's only one season. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause the manga's doing insane
numbers right now as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I saw the manga sales
of the last month in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's number one, number two, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> number three, number four, number five, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all volumes of "Spy x Family." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's how it always is with the anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause an anime comes out, all right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and manga gets a giant boost in sales. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - 'Cause people wanna read the manga. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so I'm like, man, Shonen Jump </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just can't miss right now 'cause this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't even think "Spy x Family" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was going to be the big show
that they released this year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought it was gonna be- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey and Garnt] "Chainsaw Man." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then "Spy"-
- When is that coming out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's coming out this year as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I think it's the summer, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Okay-
- Summer- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Next season, I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like that's been, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone's like, "I'm so hype for that." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> And I'm just like, "Yeah,
weren't we hype a year ago?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> Wait, what's going on with that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude, Fujimoto just released
three one-shots in that span. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh my God, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which you fucking need to read. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He brought out a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> I recently read a one-shot
called "Goodbye, Eri." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - By him, and it's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> It's probably one of the best
one-shots I've ever read. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The dude manages to
basically give the plot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of a movie's worth of plot in 200 pages. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's fucking incredible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I read it the other
day 'cause Twitch chat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like, "Have you read
it, have you read it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have you read it yet?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can read it for free as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> On the Jump+, I'm making
it sound like an ad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not even paid for this shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Thanks, Shueisha. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll wait for my royalties. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do they need us to shout them out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to know that Shonen Jump exists? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So Jump+ is on another
fucking level right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like being like, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> shout out to Disney, by the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Loving the stuff you're
doing with Marvel, whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They own the entire world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Waiting for the royalties soon, Disney. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Walt, I'm waiting for your call, Walt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause even Disney now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have also come into the anime
race, you know, fucking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They've picked up one of the
best seasonal animes, I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> is (indistinct), </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which is like "Summertime Render," </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which no one can really
watch right now because- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Is it on Disney+? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's on Disney+.
- It's on Disney+. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - What the fuck?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> It's on Disney+ </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's a Disney+ exclusive. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> But they're not releasing it- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Back in my day, all the anime </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> was on one platform. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Camera Person] One
more anime that was aired </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a couple of seasons back
is in Disney+ as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Camera Person] (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it actually?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck.
- I see ads on Facebook, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> everywhere's like,
(indistinct) on Disney+. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck.
- That's so weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> What a weird timeline we're living in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where Disney is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "You kids ever heard of anime before?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> That's so weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so surreal to think
that it's gotten to this point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where now Disney is getting
involved in the anime arms race. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought they just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they had their thing
with Ghibli, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I never thought they
cared about anything else </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> outside of Ghibli. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I always thought
Disney's idea of anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was just "Princess Mononoke." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- That's a movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Anyway. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it made by Hayao
Miyazaki or not, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> I guess it just doesn't exist then. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Doesn't exist.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw you finally
completed Elden Ring as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I did, Elden Ring was very fun. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - How was that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Great game, when are you gonna play it? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - When I-
- When I have free time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - When I have time to invest
on being addicted to something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- It's amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Elden Ring's amazing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, 'cause I saw you playing it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I'm like, God fucking damn, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that looks so fun but I know- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It is, it's really fun. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I know as soon
as I start Elden Ring, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just gonna be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I started Breath of the Wild again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> where-
- Goodbye productivity. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, goodbye productivity, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> goodbye free time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I am doing nothing
but playing this game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - How many hours did you sink into it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nearly 70, I think.
- Okay, that's not too bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - On my first play through. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's really, really fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I got to say it's probably
one of the best games </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I've played ever. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I know people who sank 200 hours </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> and still haven't beaten it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Well, yeah, 'cause I mean, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I like to play games on stream </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't really wanna, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right now, I don't wanna
keep playing it on stream </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I've streamed it a shit ton </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I could easily do
multiple play throughs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and enjoy every second of it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's some, I didn't even see all of it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I missed so much stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause it's open world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so there's just so much to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, honestly, really,
really amazing game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So many cool fights, really
fun, really satisfying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> One of the best game
designs just hands down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> The world, oh my God, dude. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> The world building in that game </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is just second to none. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You've never seen a world built like that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never heard you talk
about world building before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I never cared. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just like, Connor,
what, it must be fucking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know something's up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when Mr. Game Mechanics over here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is like "World building, though, ooh!" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never cared. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But the fact that they build
so many cool set pieces. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just these giant areas
that you go to once </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, how much hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did they sink in building this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you're there for
10 minutes, you're gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or this one boss fight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they built this whole giant thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> leading up to the boss
fight, and it's like, what, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what the fuck? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, oh my God, just some
of the areas you're like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> this is so cool and creative. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How the fuck did you come up with this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Miyazaki, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> He's build-
- It's insane. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's insane. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> The whole, I've never cared
about how a game world looks </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's like, okay,
you go into a place, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the boss arena, you leave. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, every single aspect of this world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just so cool and tells
an interesting story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's honestly such a good game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Really, really fucking good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, one thing that's
really surprised me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about what I've seen people
talking about about Elden Ring </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is how friendly it is to beginners. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah-
- And how accessible it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can do whatever you need to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 'cause I feel like
because it's open world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and because there are so many options, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in previous Souls games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get to a hard boss or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you get to this one point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and people who were not as
pro-gamer, whatever, you know- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's a hard skill cap, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, there is a hard skill cap </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where they could do nothing
aside from try to beat this boss </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and if they couldn't beat this boss, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> then I guess they just give up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or they just do something else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but because Elden Ring is open world, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there is just so much more opportunity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If they find a hard boss, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then they can try doing something else, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they can grind up a bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or I've heard that there
are many different builds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and many different variations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to whatever type of play
style you wanna do as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And some are definitely
easier than others. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, some are completely busted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's the busted ones, then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's the blood one. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> There's a bleed mechanic in the game </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> with certain swords
that cause 'em to bleed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and does percent damage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So percent damage on bosses
you can imagine is quite big. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And some swords can apply
it very, very quickly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you can just chunk
through bosses in seconds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with some builds.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And other builds, not so much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I messed around in
the hard area a bunch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I went to the easy area </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I think I was supposed to go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you can do
whatever you want, really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But then I absolutely
steamrolled this area, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> two shotting bosses and stuff.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had gone messed around
in the really hard area </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I shouldn't have been in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that's the way I
enjoyed playing the game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was really fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it got really
difficult towards the end, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that was really fun as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was kind of
over leveled a little bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and so it was really fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just, I had a really great time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's not many boss fights
that I thought were bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All of the main bosses were sick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So fucking cool, dude.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Such cool bosses. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> Just a fun time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Really fun time streaming it as well. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Would you say it's as difficult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as people make it out to be? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Again, it's as difficult
as you want it to be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can summon spirits and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> So things that come in the fight for you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that helps a lot
'cause it just takes aggro. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The boss will stop hitting
you and hit something else. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> So then that's more useful
than them doing damage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But some of them do
damage as well, a lot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, I mean, it's great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Play it, it's fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's really, really fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I will definitely play it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I will, I just need to
find the time to do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want to there to be, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I hope there's a game that
can get game of the year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> over this game 'cause I'd welcome that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] That would be
incredible if there was- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know how that would happen- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - If there was a game of the year. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I hate being that guy that's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> "It's game of the year,"
but I don't know what- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> have you played the
new Kirby game, though? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know what could- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's pretty fucking poor. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - In my mind, I'm like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know what could top this this year </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for a gaming experience </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> that is collectively agreed upon </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to be an amazing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I'd be shocked
if it wasn't that game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'd be shocked.
- I'd be very shocked as well </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd welcome it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause that means more games for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, I haven't even played it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I reckon it's gonna be it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The only other game that's
probably better than it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> is Metal Gear Revengence </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> which I played. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> That was fun, that was great. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm just so happy the Revengence memes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> have come back. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Have you played it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I haven't played it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] You haven't played it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I feel like I've
experienced 90% of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just through memes itself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Bro, it's so good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I played it, I did it on stream </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> and yeah, it was amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What a fun game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> Cut scenes were as amazing as you think. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Armstrong is one of my
favorite video game characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> of all time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - How did the Japanese portray America </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> better than most American games, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so good.
- So good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just so cool seeing a game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that just goes beyond time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so impactful that it
doesn't matter how old it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think one thing
that really impressed me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with seeing people play
Metal Gear Revengence </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> is just the music is just fucking insane. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Dude, it's so good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not just insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it kind of matches up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> with the scene or the level
that you're playing as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like, the amount of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what sells Revengence to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I love anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Fooly Cooly that makes it feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you're watching a
music video or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as you're watching the anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But Revengence feels like
you're playing a music video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> as you're going along. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And that's the biggest
selling point for me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> with Revengence.
- It's just so good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> It's such a fun game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the mechanics are so tight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and the cut scenes are just hilarious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's so overly political </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's so funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but also it's like some things he says, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> you're like, "Oh, wow,
kinda little on the nose." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then obviously all the
memes that came out of it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are so good.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - If you haven't played the
game, again, I recommend it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - How long did it take you to complete? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I played it on hard
and I kind of regret it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'Cause I felt like there's
just so many very hard moments. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I wasn't very good at the game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's very fast.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the medium is
probably the best way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to enjoy the game initially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it'd be like five hours,
but it took me 10 hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I was playing on
hard and failing on bosses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> all the fucking time.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - So hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you play it in
one sitting, one stream? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, one sitting, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Oh, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the last fight is so worth it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause the Armstrong is
just such a fun fight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's crazy, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And the button mashing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - One way is just fucking standing there, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're just like-
- Yeah, he's... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> Nano machine, son. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel I'm part of the
meme experience now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why, I'd played it before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'd gotten halfway and I quit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I got stuck
'cause it's a hard game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Some of the boss
fights are fucking hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- So yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean play on normal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you want a chill
time or more easy, even. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I definitely wanna play it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can do it in five hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just one stream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And two hours is cut scenes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, brilliant, brilliant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> My favorite. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, it's literally- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, it is a Kojima game. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's-
- You know, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's so good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> It's so good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If you haven't played it, go and watch it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> You've probably watched all
the incorrect telling of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and all that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where the names come from. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that I made it the fuck up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and making the mother of
all omelets here, Jack. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I love that-
- I fucking love that line. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's my favorite line.
- It's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - So good.
- Such a good game, fuck. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> What a game, what a game. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, 'cause I feel like I would game, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> there's one console I
really, really fucking want </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's the Steam Deck. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - You want the Steam Deck?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause so many times, I'm just not in- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - That'd be a fun game to play
on the Steam Deck, actually. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's less about
just the Steam Deck itself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's more of, there's so many games </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just wanna play on the go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because, especially now
we're traveling so much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I don't stream as often as you guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> There's less time where I
sit down in front of the PC </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or on a couch and I game, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But if there was, that's why I like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the console I game the most on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is probably whenever I play a Switch game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's just so easy to just pick up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever I need to play it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just continue it
at my own convenience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was always looking for a console </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to play the more intensive games on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> While also going on the go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the Steam Deck seems perfect for that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but, my God, is it
impossible to get right now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - The waiting list for that is... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know some people who've got it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, "How the
fuck did you get it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who did you sell your blood to?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I've seen the prices on eBay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're twice to triple the price </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and the waiting list, I think
right now is a few months </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it's not too bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Only a few months. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I say that's not too bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I know the people who
got the first shipping of it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they had to sign up a year
plus before, I believe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fucking- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I've heard mixed things about it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> There's some good things, some bad things. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> But overall, I think it's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> From what I've seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's the mixed things
you've heard about it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I saw that the,
some games it struggles with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember what I saw. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember there was some downsides. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Weeks ago, I watched these videos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember it wasn't perfect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I mean, when is it? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - When is it, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, I'm not, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really care about the frame rates </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or the FPS or whatever too much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, I just want a competent
gaming experience on the go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for some games that I would
normally play on the PC </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or somewhere else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that seems that's all I really want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from the Steam Deck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that seems like the perfect console </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to what I need right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Seems so, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Definitely.
- Man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are you playing now, Joey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How's Kirby? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I haven't done
the post-game stuff yet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but yeah, I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've just kinda been fucking around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just trying to play a bunch of stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I started playing Kaizo Emerald </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which is one of the hardest Pokemon mods. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That mod is hard as shit. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It took me six hours
to beat the first gym. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Connor] Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, it's hard as shit. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Well, why is it hard? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because not only is, well, first of all, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every trainer is unavoidable.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you have to fight every trainer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and every trainer is optimized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So literally every trainer fight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is like fighting a
professional Pokemon player. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So the moves are optimized.
- Oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And all the IVs are
optimized and everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're basically
just going against that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's intense as fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Have you seen those people
beating the Pokemon games </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> with level one Pokemon? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they beat-
- How is that possible? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like Smallant and stuff, right, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, 'cause you swap
out poison, substitute, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> basically all the moves that make you rage </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> when you have it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like, I'll try and
play Pokemon competitively. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You play and then someone's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> substitute, mimic, poison spikes, reflect, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's like (hand slams) stop! </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me hit it! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me hit your Pokemon! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Literally, I knew it was bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> because for one, the first rival fight, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just spammed sand attack seven times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and then it just slowly drained my Pokemon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to the point where I
lost the first battle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like, this isn't
gonna go well at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, I wanna do more Pokemon runs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The Pokemon runs are so fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I'm probably gonna continue that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause that's just like, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> As a long-time Pokemon gamer, I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is the first time where I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Finally, a Pokemon game
is actually a challenge." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Finally a worthy opponent.
- Finally a worthy opponent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You thought Nuzlockes were hard, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this game is fucking hard, yeah, so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So what's the base game that it mods? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pokemon Emerald. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Emerald, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - All the mods are on Emerald, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Weirdly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's usually third gen, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I wonder why. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Usually Emerald or, I don't know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe it's because it's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Easy to.
- A fan favorite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it's a solid game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- But there's also </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of mods for gen
four and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - There's tons of mods for
Breath of the Wild and stuff. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know how they do it, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> it sounds cool, though. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - I really wanna play mods </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> for Breath of the Wild and Switch games, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm also scared to fuck my Switch up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, exactly, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Well, Breath of the
Wild is one of the games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you can definitely see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that being a modders heaven, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause you have so much
freedom in that game as it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> in the base game, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't imagine how it would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if it was like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've seen so many
cool mod videos of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen everything's Among Us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not kidding. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone's the Among Us... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I like it, I just like it, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like the one, the
fucking PointCrow video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where when he says Shrek, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it summons 10 Shreks into the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah, I saw that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is the dumbest video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but it was so fun to watch.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When is Among Us gonna die? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> When am I gonna stop finding
Among Us memes funny? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I thought I would-
- Never. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like they've gotten funnier </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they're starting to
become ironic, that's why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - Did you see the Among Us VR? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I was gonna say, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It actually looks good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> It looks fun. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That genuinely looks good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> That might be a game I can finally get VR. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just can't wait for
the clips of Xbox mics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and someone's like this
with their Among Us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Dude, you fucking-
- It was this guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't wait to do the credit card on VR. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Ugh! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm so hype for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It actually looked awesome. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It looks fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Really fun, yeah.
- I can't wait for it, dude. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm so hyped. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, I'm hoping they
do include the voice chat </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> within the Among Us games this time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh, proximity.
- Yeah, proximity chat, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that'd be awesome.
- Yeah, that'd be fun. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - 'Cause I can't imagine having
to log into Discord in VR </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> and having to log out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, it's gonna have
to be proximity chat. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It would be also perfect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if you did it on the
omni-directional moving pad as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so you literally have to run
through the halls and shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - That'd be so fun.
- That'd be so fun. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - I really wanna own those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but it just seems impractical. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When's that coming out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I saw the trailer-
- No idea, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they didn't have a release date </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> which normally means whenever
the fuck they finish it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is probably a while. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which could be next year. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, they should, I
hope they charge for it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause I want it to be worth their time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, I mean, it feels like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they completely
just remade the game, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So they've basically just
built a new game, essentially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> from the ground up.
- Basically, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I don't think they
could have used anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> from their previous game, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which was originally a mobile game. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- To going full on VR. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's gonna be hard.
- So yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm very excited </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to try it out.
- Crazy. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> Might finally be able to
dust off the Valve Index. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Valve Index which I've never been- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still use mine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's pretty good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> VRChat's pretty fun.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, VRChat's good. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just such a hassle to set up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I kind of wish I got
the Oculus or whatever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which, 'cause that just seems
so much more convenient than, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I get you get more freedom
with the Index and everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's high resolution, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I still haven't streamed
on my Oculus though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just 'cause I'm dreading to set it up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Optimize the Index </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just 'cause I have the
things permanently up there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's super easy.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I literally just plug in the headset, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> open up Steam and I'm literally doing it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> so it's super painless for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Even then, I still get tired doing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I get exhausted.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - After three, four hours
of running around in VR, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm spent. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm surprised you can
even spend that long. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't go more than two hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - In any game, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> - Seriously, dude, it's really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> VRChat is so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like the mods on it and the
games in VRChat are so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm not Zuckerberg. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Shaking his fist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The power's with the people, Zuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't you understand? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah, but I mean, I
guess this is gonna be, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess we have a bunch
of guests coming on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the next episode, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So this is gonna be the
last boys episode for a while. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For a while.
- For a while. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Which I'm sure people are happy about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause we've had the
longest period of no guests. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I feel like you can tell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause people are like- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - When's the next guest? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - To be fair, it's our bad. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, it's been hard </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause the guests have been
limited 'cause, you know, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Japan has- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - We can't be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's invite Chris on a
fucking 10th time, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - We could have invited back more guests </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> but we thought, we kinda
just wanna try and- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Keep it trying fresh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Keep it fresh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Obviously, Chris is the
fourth member, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Basically. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Chris is welcome back on anytime. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> Basically, whenever he's
in Tokyo, he comes on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, so hopefully if you
guys want more guest episodes, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> you'll be getting a lot coming soon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now that the world is opening up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kinda like the
flood gates are now open. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> when are the boys gonna just
go back to the three of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause we're probably gonna have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of guest episodes in a row. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I know people are gonna say that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause people do like the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> not that people don't like
the non-guest episodes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people do actually really like them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I know a lot of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> say that their favorites. </SPEAKER_05>

sprinkle in ours between. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Be interesting to see how people like it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>

of "Trash Taste,'" I think. </SPEAKER_03>

gonna feel a little different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a time, so look forward to that. </SPEAKER_03>
