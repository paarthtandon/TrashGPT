<SPEAKER_02> poo-poo is one of the
funniest things I've ever said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> out loud
- Do you know like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know how poop jokes were
like funny when you were five? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you hit teenager
and they stopped being funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then as an adult,
they get like funny again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah what is that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is up with?
- I don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is it, no, it's
more like what is it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with like teenage years,
where you're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "No, pee and poo jokes are out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm more intelligent than that now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me look.

<SPEAKER_01> learn about the world with
some high quality comedy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then five years later you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Big PP Nation what's up?"
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God.
- Uncultured. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Uncultured, clearly. I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm the biggest offender of it, I'm there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you are.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if anyone is Big PP

<SPEAKER_00> - How I think I am like

<SPEAKER_00> you know the one with

<SPEAKER_03> you know?
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my gosh, so what are
we talking about today guys? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I mean we can talk about anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought I would tell
a story to begin with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was in my Japanese class this- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Story time with Connor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Story time it's (laughs). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's story time with Connor.
(Joey humming) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right so, I was in my
Japanese class, as I do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> learn Japanese, not very
successfully as always, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you know, I turn up,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, I'm helping.
- Yeah, you're there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're there.
- I'm helping,. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I'm helping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was, in the break time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we get like a five minute break. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't know why, it's only two hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't really feel like you need a break </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for two hours and you
know, whatever, anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we get a break, and we're chilling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like the lounge area,
it's like that kinda hip- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lounge area? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They have like a kind of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like this like fake,
hip college kind of area. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Yeah, sit where you want man," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like everything's a chair.
- Oh! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh.
- It's like, and so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just sitting and then, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was talking with my teacher and then, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a guy, right next to
me, like here, is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey, do I know you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do, do I know?"
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's always the worst. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm like, "No." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "I don't know." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's like, "You're a YouTuber right?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have my mask on, bear in mind, as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was like, "Yeah,
yeah, I guess that's me." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just stared at him, and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was so caught off guard,
I didn't know what to say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was just,
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like, I
looked just dead in the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the Mike Wazowski meme, again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love that meme.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just looked at him
like, "Yeah, I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, yeah I am."
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just stared at him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I was like,
"Oh no, that was pretty, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "he probably thinks I'm an ass-hole now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So if you're watching this, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just stared at you blankly,
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you recognized me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, wait, so he came
up to you and was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You're the YouTuber right?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you said, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then he just didn't say anything or? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He was like, "Oh yeah, I
think I've seen your stuff." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "Oh, thanks." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love it when you like get
recognized and they come over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're like, "Hey,
you're that guy right?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you say, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then, you kind of see the
realization on their face, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they didn't plan the conversation out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> any point after they said that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean?
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just 'cause I didn't expect it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like in my Japanese class in like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, in Japan.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's a lot of
foreigners there, admittedly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's only like, a lot
of older people than me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So I just didn't just expect it to- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, what is up with some
people who are just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, he's a YouTuber." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He'll leave the conversation
on right afterwards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't mind, I felt bad, 'cause </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I felt like I should have been like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh man, how're you doing or something?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because, because.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was just like, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because when you get recognized, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not at an Anime Convention, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I feel like when you get recognized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in an Anime Convention, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're prepared for it.
- You're like in the zone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like, okay, I'm expecting this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like know how to handle this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but when it's just out
on the streets, IRL- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just like not near a convention. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- In my daily life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, just in your daily life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you just get blindsided. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I've had.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because you get caught
during like your off period, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because like at a con, you're
always on your on period, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you're like, "All right,
there's people around me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> people looking for me."
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, not like, not
to be like egotistical, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but at a con you know there's
gonna be some people like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's an anime convention.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know people are gonna know you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so you're like ready for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, you know, when I'm just
at my school or on the gym, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like the the last
thing that's in my head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that I'm a YouTuber, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just thinking like, wish
I could get my fucking day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> over with, right?
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was like the time
where I got recognized by, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was the first time I
was ever recognized by, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a straight up Japanese person, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't speak a word of English </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese person.
- Oh whoa! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was a fucking salary man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like, his mid-40's.
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, when he like tapped
me on the shoulder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I turn around, there was
this just this mid-40's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like borderline ugly
bastard looking fucking- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh that poor guy.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I'm serious, it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> borderline ugly bastard looking guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like, "Oh no,
I'm in danger." (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Turbo past the x-ray.
- I'm gonna need a (laughs). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause like I'm in danger and then, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in Japanese he was like,
"Oh, you're the YouTuber </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who collabed with Kizuna Ai, right?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And immediately,
- That's how he knows you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, immediately I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Ah, you're a Kuzuna Ai fan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of course you are."
- Yeah, of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course you are.
(Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You look like a VTuber fan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I said like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're just offending all the Vtubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right now.
- Yeah, whoa, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> call me out like that Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, you look like
a Japanese VTuber fan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I was like, "Yeah, yeah, I did." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I think it was,
like maybe one or two weeks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after I did my first
collab with Kizuna Ai? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- And that was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a really big thing for me where
I got a lot of Japanese eyes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on me because before that,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, because I don't
really speak in Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on my channel right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Japanese people aren't
subscribed to my shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- But when I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on Kizuna Ai's channel,
'cause I spoke Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got a lot of like Japanese people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who, you know, came to
my channel, obviously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the salary man was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, after I saw your
collab with Kizuna Ai," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, sorry, no, he said, (speaks Japanese). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, "Oh yeah,
you're definitely a fan." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "So after I saw your collab with AI-chan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I subscribed to your channel." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Oh, do you understand? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like can you speak English?"
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he's like, "No, but I watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your videos to learn English." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Hmm." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just in the back of my head I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> going through my entire.
- All the terrible, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff.
- All the terrible things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All of the terrible shit, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm pretty sure I say
cunt like every three words </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my videos."
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "I don't."
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so, jokingly, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh yeah, I mean my videos aren't the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to learn English with." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And in a straight face he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "No, actually I've learned
a lot, from your videos." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've learned.
- Oh no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I was like, "No, no, no" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [All] No, no, no." (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But yeah, that was scary though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Have you ever been recognized
by a Japanese person? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I've been recognized once, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> by a Japanese person in Japan.
- Oh really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like the most
random place 'cause I think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember what
date it was, but I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like on a date with Sydney, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> somewhere in Japan and we went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to this like random
Italian restaurant, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- It was like a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> local run Italian restaurant,
but it was like run </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by a Japanese person.
- Mmmh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we come in, and for some
reason the Japanese person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was just like, the guy
waitering us was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like super, super nice.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we thought he was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this overenthusiastic Japanese person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who was like.
- Yeah, it happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah he was just like
trying to speak English to us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything, and we're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Aw man, this is a really nice restaurant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if they're
just nice to everyone here." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then we get the bill, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he puts on like this
massive discounts on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we're like, "There
must be a mistake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We got like the wrong bill or something." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- So we go up to the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so we go up to the guy, trying
to speak our broken Japanese, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just to say like, this is wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is the wrong price.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he goes like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he also communicates in broken English </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Japanese being like,
"Oh no, I just wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "to say thank you for
everything you've done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have, like, I watched
your videos to help, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again learn English." (laughs)
- Learn English. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm like, "Man, why are our videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> being used as a resource
to learn English?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There are so many good videos out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where you can actually learn English. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Why, don't use any YouTube
videos to learn English. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- It's never a good idea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Although I dunno, like
I feel like whenever I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if I ever get to meet
a VTuber and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Man, thank you for helping me learn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese." (laughs)
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm wondering if they're
gonna have the same kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of reaction on the other side. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah, who's this guy, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna talk shit
about him on the podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like the, that's like the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that cashier, at the
Family Mart near our house, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's like a fan of my videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And every now and then
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like if when I go to the
Family Mart near my house, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> late at night, and he's
working there late at night, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- He's sometimes just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yo, come here and he like leads me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to the cash register and he's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "See all this chicken in here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're gonna throw it out."
- Yeah, they give you it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they give you it.
- "Do you just want some?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And he just gives me the free
fucking Family Mart chicken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, "mmmh, yeah, sure why not?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is probably gonna kill
me, but it's all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll take some free chicken, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Shout out to you by the way,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whatever your name is, I
don't know what your name is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I actually got recognized
last week as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the last week.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a bit.
- God cam con. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Go on, calm down man.
- It's a bit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a bit of an awkward story though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Go on.
- And what's awkward about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is the guy mentions that
he watches Trash Taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every week so- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so I'm about
to tell the story and, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hello guy who's probably watching this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's probably shitting
his pants right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs)
He's like, that's me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because, okay, because it was a bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of an awkward experience,
I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not like (chuckles).
(Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the thing is, I'm probably gonna see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this guy again in the future because. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay so, where I met this guy was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at an anime bar in Akihabara. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I went to this anime bar in Akihabara </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was a really, really cool bar, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was like kind of small. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't remember the name of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think Meilyne was the
one who told me about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I remember that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I went in there, and immediately,
one guy recognizes me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I didn't see that, Meilyne saw that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Japanese guy or Western guy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We thought he was Japanese, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but he was like Californian.
- California, okay yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like you know
when you get recognized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's just like that look.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where it's just like.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like the triple-take, right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I haven't had one that aggressive, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can you guys explain?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, but like, you know like when you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> at an Anime Convention,
and you're just like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're like, debating about whether </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they should say hello for
like the next five minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- I see you, just come. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like if that ever happens, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if that ever happens,
just please, just come. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Come, come.
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No!
- Come now! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm so sorry that we
always reference that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just,
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't stop fucking
laughing at that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Anyway, go on.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah, so we're sitting at the bar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the waiter comes up to us and goes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, do you mind if that
guy says hello to you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Apparently he knows you from some way." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "yeah, sure."
- The waiter did this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the waiter did this.
- Oh wow, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like fucking romance thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like did he?
(man laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, so I think he asked the waiter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so he comes says hello and
we have a nice friendly chat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, he was a friendly,
he seemed like a friendly guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, you know, it wasn't
anything more than that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just like, oh, you
know, what are you doing here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you work here? Do you live here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just the casual banter.
- Yeah, just for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the casual small talk, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't seem like that weird or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But, (laughs) but, so we you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we go back to our tables
and we just you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> carry on the night and that
was my last interaction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with him.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, and so as we're leaving, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the bar's closed early because of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, corona and everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know everywhere
closes early in Tokyo now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we're going out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we go down the lift,
and just as he's about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get in the lift, the
lift is kind of like full. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's just like our group
and we go down the lift, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we have no idea where
we're about to go right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because we're like, is
anywhere even open right now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And one person says that
there's like a Karaoke place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right next to, right next to the bar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is like anime themed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that sounds fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- So, we go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to this karaoke themed, I'm sorry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this anime themed karaoke,
and we get the Ava room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's such a fucking,
it's such an awesome room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I gotta tell you.
- Oh, we gotta go there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I gotta take you guys there sometime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so we're chilling
in there for like a good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good like 10 minutes, just like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> choosing our beers, getting some food, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know, picking our songs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then one of the waiter comes in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and brings in like an extra towel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which if you've ever been
to a Japanese establishment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you come in, you get the wet towels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Everyone gets a wet towel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for like how many people there are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- So we start asking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh did someone order an extra towel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something what's going on?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then the guy, just waltzes in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and goes like,
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (claps) "Boys, can I join you?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I look around, and I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was talking.
- Oh my God! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He was talking to someone
else in the group at the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I look at him, to be
like, "Did you invite him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I didn't invite him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sidney didn't invite him,
Meilyne didn't invite him, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think, so it must've been you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just saw like the look
of confusion on his face. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just, immediately.
- It wasn't me, it wasn't me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was just immediately like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, okay. No one invited him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Um, okay, how the fuck did he know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we were in this specific
room when we didn't even know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we were in this specific room?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing)
- That so creepy! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That only just means then
that he followed you guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but I don't
know how he followed us, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because as we walked to the karaoke place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so, we didn't know we
were going to the karaoke place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until after we had gotten out of the bar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay.
- And he wasn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there behind us, so,
apparently like he said that's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> he's like he knows everyone in the place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's a regular.
- All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so, somehow he found out we were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in this specific room, and he, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apparently he just thought he
was, he could just join us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, right.
- And if you're watching this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guy, which you probably are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As a fan of Trash Taste.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As a fan of Trash Taste. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is totally a call-out because, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, as I'm probably gonna be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in the area.
- You're gonna say it now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna say this now, as the same as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna say it probably
the next time I see you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bruh, like, that was pretty creepy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if we had interacted more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would have been like
totally fine, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> If we had invited you or if you had like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you had like talked to us beforehand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the fact that you just showed up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing)
like unannounced, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we didn't know how you got. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We didn't know how you knew where we were. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like we didn't even know
we were gonna be there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I don't know what you were expecting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- I'd like to think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that he was expecting like the
moment he'd come in the room, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you were all just like, turn around like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> welcome, you did it, you did it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Congratulations.
(laughing and clapping) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Join us, you found us,
you solved the mystery. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can now join us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have unlocked the
secret ending, please enjoy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I mean it's at
like conventions though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as well, right, people
do that all the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- It's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember I was with Emirichu
at a con, and Emily comes up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me, 'cause we were
hanging out the whole con </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause we really didn't know anyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's two guys with her. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She's like, "We getting lunch Connor?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Yeah, who are those two?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she was like, "Oh, I don't know." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "What are they,
(man laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what are they, what are they doing?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, "They asked if
they could join us for lunch." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Do you want them to?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she was like, "Not really." (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "All right, okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Hey guys,
we don't really know you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we're gonna get lunch, sorry." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I feel- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause some people like, you know like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like how'd you guys.
- Don't wanna be the ass-hole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like how do you
guys handle that because- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just straight up them, I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey man, I don't know who you are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna get."
- There's really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no nice way of saying that unfortunately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You just have to, I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I can tell that sometimes
when people do that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they don't mean it in like a creepy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no.
- No, you're right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of them just
you know, they've met, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who might be someone they really look up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And this is their one
chance to socialize with them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they maybe you know,
don't really think about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hey it might be a little weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you just kind of like follow someone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean I'd like to feel like I'm pretty, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm a pretty open guy in terms of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> social situations.
- Oh yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm definitely like happy to meet people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've had plenty of situations where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know we were at a
social gathering or a party, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then, you know, we join someone else's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> karaoke room.
- And someone's cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like, "Hey man, come on." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but you know there
are like several steps </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you have to take before that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before both parties like
mutually comfortable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with something like that.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, which is you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is equally a message
to everyone at conventions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and everything like that because, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure we have a lot
of different stories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of just awkward social situations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you don't really know people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they kind of just invite
themselves into your group. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I feel like it would be the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whether we're famous
or like not, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, yeah, it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> general social skills.
- Yeah, it's like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think my absolute pet
peeve though, more than that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is because, like, you
know, at least with people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who try and get a little too social </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with us or whoever they admire right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And try and sneak themselves
into our friend group </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever, is that at least
you can just straight up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> be like, "Okay, you know,
I'm not cool with this," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or whatever, you can directly
do something about it right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah.
- What I find worse than that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this is sometimes at conventions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is sometimes just out in public, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is when they take a photo
of you, from a distance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Oh yeah, that's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then they tag you,
either on Twitter or Instagram, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, "I saw, Joey
at blah, blah, blah." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just like, it's
just, it's like paparazzi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, it's so.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I had one, oh
I forgot where it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was some con in the US but, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we were no where near the con. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we were just hanging out at some mall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Because we had already </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> finished all our panels and whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're just hanging out with
a couple of my friends, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then, you know, it was fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, we didn't really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> we ran into like maybe like two
or three people or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They came up to us and
said hello and whatnot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I went back to the hotel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was just checking through Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I saw this photo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of me, but it looked like
I was on the ground floor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know how some malls they have like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a big where the open?
- Yeah the open top right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It looked like someone had taken a photo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of Aki and I from like the fifth floor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was this- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Enhanced, enhanced. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah no, no, we didn't
even have to enhance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because they drew a red circle around us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hey man, they made
the thumbnails for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they made the thumbnail for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They were like, they were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they drew a red circle
around us and being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "I saw Aki and Joey at so-and-so mall." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, "That's fucking
terrifying, Jesus Christ." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If he saw us, then just
like, it would have been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> less embarrassing and less creepy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if they had just fucking shouted my name </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from the fifth floor right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- Then at least </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would know that they're there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But they were like, "I
can't let them see me." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (imitates shutter clicking)
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why would you do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like, I get it, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're sometimes really nervous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I know they tweeted me sometimes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- I get they're nervous right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- But there's a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a difference
between being nervous, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and being creepy, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, I understand,
like I try to be as like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> understandable as I can with- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No of course.
- With, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like, people being nervous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't scold them or anything, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't call them out
on Twitter or whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's happened more than once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- But every time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I see stuff like that, and
thankfully it hasn't happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a long, long, long time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But, whenever every now and
then when stuff like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> does pop up on my Instagram
or or Twitter or whatever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, "Dude, come on." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing)
I mean just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you were literally,
you took a photo of me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was another one when
I was back home in Sydney, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right?
- And I was just like walking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I was, I think
I was walking around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with my sister or something,
and someone had taken a photo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of me from behind, but it wasn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> from like even that much of a distance. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was literally like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like-
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, I've had that, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was just like,
"That's fucking terrifying." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because if I had turned
around at that moment, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- I don't know what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they would have done.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Would they've just stood
there like Mike Wazowski like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "I wasn't taking a photo, I swear." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Bye. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No I don't know, I
mean people can just talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to me whenever, like I might. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Like look at them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> blankly for a second as I realize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's happening but,
I mean, you can always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come up to me.
- But if you're that close </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to me to take a photo, just come up to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just, just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna talk to people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like talking to people.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, as long as you, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just come on in like a nice friendly way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, as long as you don't come up to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and like grill the shit out of me like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't care, just come up to me, like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But that's the thing though right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think a lot of people
don't like to come up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to YouTubers or whoever they admire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's their private time currently. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I don't give a shit.
- I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Unless I'm like eating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at a restaurant, like if I'm sitting down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> clearly eating, don't.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've said that a
number of times, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or if I'm in like a
private karaoke room, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing)
for example you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now that's.
- At my house, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing)
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But if I'm walking around
in public I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like talk to me.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Same here, I love having conversations- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So this is a PSA, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If there are any Trash Tastes
fans and you see any of us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> out on the streets wherever,
just come up to us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just come up to us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And if it's an awkward situation, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're just probably gonna
tell it on the podcast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, we won't.
- So, just don't fuck it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't fuck it up.
(man laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you don't wanna be called
out on the podcast. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm kidding, there's like
100 awkward interactions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we haven't talked about here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah dude, we could
dedicate an entire episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to shit like that.
- And we should some day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just saying.
- I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I gotta ask you, have
you guys ever had that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the other way around, where you've been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the nervous wreck meeting someone? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've had that once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've had like a fanboy moment- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why is Meilyne laughing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, why are you laughing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] I've- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We know you've been there Meilyne. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's Meilyne's life.
- That's just you in general. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've had that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never understood like
the fanboy moment in my life, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> until maybe, I think it
was two or three years ago, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't remember if I told
it the podcast or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was at Otakuthon
in Montreal, Canada. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was a guest there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And one of the other
guests was Obata Takeshi, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who is the illustrator for Death Note. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh whoa.
- And Bakuman and you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically that guy.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he was a guest, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I knew he was a guest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, there were lots of
guests at that convention, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I was like, "I know
he's a guest but I'm, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's such a massive con. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I'm probably not gonna see him." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we went to the opening ceremony </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause we had to go to
the opening ceremony. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Of course he wasn't at
the opening ceremony. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's too busy for that.
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He was too busy for that, all right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm just like, it's whatever, like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, you know, I might see a poster </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of him somewhere or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right?
- I'll see a poster. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I'll see him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in the distance.
- No, 'cause like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When you're two guests at a
convention, that means nothing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Especially 'cause.
- I know, I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- He's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he doesn't seem like the kind of guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who I was just like meet
in the green room right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like he's gonna have like
his own room or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> He was easily like the
biggest guest at that con. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I was like, "Okay, that's cool." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean it's cool that I'm
in the same building as him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or whatever but it's whatever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I don't see him, totally fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, we finish the opening ceremony </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we're walking towards our first panel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I think Aki was with me and she, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she was like, "Joey,
you should turn around." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Why?' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's like, "'Cause look at the guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's like directly behind you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I turn around and
it was Obata Takeshi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just kind of standing there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was just like, kind of looking at me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like silently, and immediately,
'cause he has such a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause he's like, he's
got bald head, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like very distinct looking dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I immediately knew, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Holy shit, that's Obata Takeshi." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And anybody would tell you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're a guest at a
con with Obata Takeshi, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is like the most
optimal moment to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hi."
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Hello," right?
- You could be like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was the perfect timing to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm a guest of this con
too, and I'm a massive fan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of your work," or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't say anything.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I legit was like, (laughs)
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was, and at that moment I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh my God, this is the fanboy moment." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I understand it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you really can't say anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You just get, that was the
definition of just dumbstruck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I think I was
so caught off guard, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I didn't expect him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be literally standing right here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Looking at me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why he was
looking at me either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing)
Like silently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was like.
- Was he off? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was he off? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he was like.
- Did you speak to him at all? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- Oh, damn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You would have loved to speak to him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Japanese.
- I know, I know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I should have, I missed that opportunity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I regret it to this day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I've had a similar experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when I first moved to Japan,
and it was when Meilyne took me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to a Hiroyuki Sawano concert. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we go to this Hiroyuki Sawano concert, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's not the type of concert </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you think it's gonna be, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When I heard Hiroyuki Sawano concert, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Big bass, big drums, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is gonna be in your face." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, it was like at this
really, really posh jazz bar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it wasn't, I wouldn't
even call it a concert </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because everyone had
like, everyone had tables </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and posh little cocktails,
and he was just playing a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of like acoustic versions
of what he was, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of a lot of the songs.
- That's cool though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's pretty cool.
- That's cool though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of a lot of songs he's composed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was, it was more like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it was more like a private
jazz bar kind of deal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was still fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so after the concert, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Meilyne like asked me, "Hey,
do you wanna meet him?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was just like so unprepared. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I thought
I was just going there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to see one of my favorite anime composers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I wasn't, I didn't
know Meilyne had like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the fucking contacts that can- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course she fucking does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which, now knowing her now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of course she does.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But back then, 'cause this was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I had just moved to Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so we go, we go to
the green room or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm waiting outside,
and I'm just like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (breathing heavily) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Holy fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Heavy breathing.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just like, I haven't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I haven't emotionally prepared myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like what am I going to do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> What am I going to say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And like the, I was reciting
all the basic fucking Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I know at the time.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor speaking Japanese) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like okay, I just need to say something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- I need to say something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then so, he comes out, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "It's Hiroyuki Sawano,
it's Hiroyuki Sawano." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then so, Hiro said,
"Do you want a picture?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And everything, and I'm like, "Yeah, sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sure I'll have a picture."
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, so we take the picture, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I was like, oh
I just wanted to say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want in my mind, I wanted to say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, thank you very much for your work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything you've done." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Didn't fucking say anything, and so he, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like after the picture, I'm
just staring at him like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he looks up, and he looks at Meilyne, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then he's just like, "Was that it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, I'm just gonna go back now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he goes back to the
green room and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Oh fuck, that was that guy." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was that guy.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why, that's
the thing though, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is like, now that I've
experienced that moment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't blame anybody who does that to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like their favorite person, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right?
- Exactly, exactly. I get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get it.
- I completely understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how it feels, like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everything you recite in your head </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just goes out the fucking window. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I've never had that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really never?
- Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think maybe, I'm trying to think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of who would, maybe
like, Araki, I'd be like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, oh yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like that's like
maybe it, like I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, like I, it's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I see people who are
maybe like, big things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in stuff that I like and
I'm just kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "That's really cool."
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Maybe I should say
hi," like I was at a con, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and, there was a, Billy West,
the guy that voices like Fry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Futurama, and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> did like some of the Looney
Tunes, like the later ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like one of the most
iconic voice actors, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, I grew
up on all that stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was like, "Hi
man, nice to meet you." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And we just like, 'cause he
was using the same green room, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so we were just talking about stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but I was never like, (breathing heavily) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just like, this guy is so cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I like, remember his voice in stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, it's weird,
I guess 'cause I don't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in that moment when I see them in person, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally I don't think about their work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this is another person in front of me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- I'm gonna talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to them like that, but
maybe if it's like someone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> again, like Araki, who I'm obsessed with- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I think it's
also, for me at least, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like language
barrier, 'cause I knew- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's gotta be nerve-wracking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There were so many things
I wanted to say to him, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and if I could speak Japanese.
- You couldn't even begin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to say.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, either I
look like a nervous wreck </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or I looked like a nervous
wreck speaking broken Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what's better, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause English it's
like, you play like a word game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you don't wanna say I'm a fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like, especially
with other YouTubers right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- You don't wanna say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm an admirer 'cause
that's just kind of creepy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I normally say like, my go-to is yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like man, dude I love
your work man, it's sick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I usually say like
"I appreciate your work." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think the one guest I
got on immediately well with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was the first time I met Kevin Penkin, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who was like such a fucking lad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
- Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah but to be fair, like.
- He's an Aussie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- That's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like if he didn't
know who this guy was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd be like, "Oh it's
just another Aussie bloke." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, he totally is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's this mutual, just
like, understanding that I feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like British people and
Australian people have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they like meet, it's like,
"We're getting drunk right?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Like, we're getting drunk? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Ah, sick, we'll get drunk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas in Americans, I
feel like there's a lot more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like juggling involved, "So are you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are you a drinker?
- So do you do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [In Unison] Do you drink? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you do like, "How much you drink? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you like party and
everything like that?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because like, have you met a ton </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of Americans that just don't drink? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you can never tell, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It makes us sound like alcoholics, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how we're like, "No, we have to drink." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> No but it's like.
- No, we are alcoholics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - In a sense, in a sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's ingrained in our culture where, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if I meet like a fellow Brit or an Aussie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just-
- We're drinking right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like, "Hey, I'm having like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm having some drinks later."
- Yeah, you wanna join? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not even like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just an assumption
that they will join. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're one step away in
like Britain and Australia, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're one step away from the point of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if you don't drink we're gonna bully you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (man laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, it's that
ingrained in our culture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whereas, whenever I
meet someone American </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like an American guest or
something and I wanna get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to know them better, I'm
like, "what's the best way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to approach this, do I ask
them out for like lunch or?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some drinks? Like you
wanna get some drinks? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Pub, pub. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not pub, don't say pub.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Drinks is always way more open-ended man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, there isn't that same assumption </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that you're just gonna go
out for drinks afterwards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just like bond over a pint or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah 'cause, I feel like
if we hang out in the UK </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> during the day and you know we
haven't really said anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like, we're
getting drinks later, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, if you're ever
a guest on the podcast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably gonna get drinks after. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we have every single
time, we do it with Chris, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we do it with Carol and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who are like, who would you say is the? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well it doesn't have to be one person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but who would you say is the
coolest person you've met? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like as a fan, or as an
admirer of that person like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who would you say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If someone, if I asked you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who is the coolest person you've met. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, in the anime industry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it'd probably be Hiroyuki Sawano for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I've been a big
fan of his work for like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're not gonna say Kevin Penkin? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nah, nah.
- Kevin's just crying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Kevin knows he's a boy, man.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kevin's like, "I'm not your
favorite composer?" (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, because like, he's a great writer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I remember the
first time we met Kevin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we got like pissed together, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he starts talking about how like his, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like how he composed
for like "Made In Abyss" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and his process for everything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he starts talking about
this really like technical, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> composition, like talk and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Man, this is really fucking interesting." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like, like a lot of
people would love to hear this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like a really
interesting conversation, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but we were like pretty
hammered att that point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I remember making
a mental note being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Man, I gotta hear this again sober </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because this is like some
really interesting stuff." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - In your head you were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Wow, this is really interesting." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But what came out was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Shut up Penkin, shut up Kevin." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so like the day
afterwards, at Crunchyroll Expo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Man, so what were
you saying about composing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that scene with Mitty and
like all that stuff like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can you just repeat what you said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause that was like super interesting." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Kevin just goes, "No man, I have no idea </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the fuck I was saying." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I was fucking pissed mate." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing)
- Oh my God, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I fucking love him.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love him so much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He was so, oh man, 'cause
I remember the first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I met him IRL was when we all went. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yes, a year ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you know, the the moment I saw him, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at that you know, at the pub, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Oh shit,
that's Kevin Penkin." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then, the moment he opened his mouth, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he went from Kevin Penkin
to, "Oh look, and Aussie." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The moment I knew that
it was gonna be like fine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we were gonna get on was like, I sat down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he was like, "Right, I'm
getting a round then." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, ah, okay
and if you don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what a round is, in the UK and Australia, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we have this thing where, I
think it's a way to trap you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into having at least like seven drinks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically it's a system where, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this probably sounds
like hell to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like socially.
- Someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who doesn't drink, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's basically like, if
there's like four or five of you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> someone buys the round which
means that they buy all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the drinks for everyone.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then you kind of rotate
who does it but obviously, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't just then have one, you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to go through the whole cycle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because you
don't wanna be that guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who doesn't pay for their round. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't wanna be.
- Everyone'll know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're the stingier.
- Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't wanna in debts with anyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you're getting at least as many rounds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as there are people on the table. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly.
- Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's just like how, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's just how the
drinking culture works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's such a horrible
social trap because, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when you think about it
like, in terms of the amount </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of money you spend,
it's literally net zero. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you make it through the entire round, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but for some reason you're just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're locked into this until
the round is completely over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like whenever
I've tried to get Americans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to do this, they're like,
"No, that sounds stupid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why would we do that?"
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm like, "No, no,
just do it, just do it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a social thing, right?
- Just try, just try. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like logically, it's like yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why would I not?
- It's a way to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone drunk.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but it's just a
way to get everyone drunk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and everyone social 'cause like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're all in this together right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The moment you sit down
you are in the cold, (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you cannot leave. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So like Kevin, we're just
fucking, okay, I'm gonna. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just a 10 minute Kevin
Penkin appreciation part. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is a 10 minute Kevin rant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if you hang out with Kevin, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> he has this thing called
Oolong high or Oolong die. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And Oolong high is just like,
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the worst fucking drink that
gives you the worst hangovers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's like whiskey and Oolong right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or something like that.
- Basically there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Oolong and like.
- Or is it Shochu and Oolong? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's Shochu, Sochu, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some fucking disgusting shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like he orders this every time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I did not know that
you could order like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oolong high by the jug,
- What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In karaoke places?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But he found a way
to order it by the jug </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in karaoke places.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He was like, "You wanna
a Oolong high, right?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'll try it and I guess." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Two jugs come in and I'm like, "Kevin." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This isn't, what kind of
sample size is this? (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck? God damn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is the most Australian
fucking like phrase </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like that.
- Oh, do you wanna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just try that?
- Oolong high or oolong die? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My God!
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then there's this one other time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when I went to fucking
Yakiniku with Kevin, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was like, (laughs) why, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like all you can eat as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And so, Kevin took all you
can eat, as he takes the menu, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and he orders two of everything
off the menu. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God.
- 'Cause </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> he was just that hungry. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So much disgusting stuff
as well on that menu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and just like
the food kept turning up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was like, and
he didn't tell everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that he was ordering this much food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So we would finish
this and we will like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like that scene,
that scene in Seven </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where the guy over feeds
the first like sloth guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like kill him, that's
what it felt like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did not see the reference going there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing)
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like 'cause you were just eating food, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you were like, your stomach
was already expanded beyond, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it felt like my stomach was
fucking Jupiter or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, right.
- That's how expanded it was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then as soon as we finish, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> another round of fucking Yakiniku comes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I look at Connor, we're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why did we sign ourselves up for this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we made him tell the kitchen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> please stop, stop the order.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We take it back, like fuck go back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing)
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like pitiful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, well, we can't wait
to have Kevin on the show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you couldn't already tell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What was the original
question again? (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The original question was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who is the coolest person you've met? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it went
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to a 10 minute Kevin
Penkin appreciation post. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like when you meet
like, celebrities or whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in the right environment
like it normally results </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in really positive.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like if you're in the
green room with someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then normally, and obviously
not everyone can get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the green room sadly, but
you know, if they're in a place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they're comfortable,
and you talk to them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I find like most people you speak </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to are really fucking cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's true.
- Most, most, I mean there's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've met plenty of guests
who have been like, yikes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At conventions.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We won't go into that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, well we should leave them unnamed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't wanna get called out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that one time I punched that kid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I really don't want
that getting out there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One time punched that guest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Dude, some of the stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen guests do,
"You're like holy shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're confident doing that in front </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of like eight other guests? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yikes.
- Jesus Christ!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor exhales) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah I've seen guests
that have made like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause at cons you get like handlers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen them make their
handlers cry over like nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We're all just sitting
there in the room like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing)
Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I'm just
sitting there being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even know what
to do with my handler. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even know where
my handler is right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing)
- Yeah, I tell them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> listen, I'm fine. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe I'll need a coffee at
some point over this weekend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing)
I feel bad asking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you to do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, I feel like one guest who, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I know this is probably gonna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so like, of course,
Connor, so when I was doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my obviously Sebastian stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for so long.
- I knew where you were going. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay no, 'cause I felt
like I learned so much right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I was copying Jay Michael
Tatum's Sebastian impression </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for so fucking long, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was so worried when I
met him, 'cause I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm literally like, made my career </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at that point off just copying the dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Right, which could've gone either way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You thought it could have
been like the Spiderman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> meme like, (laughs)
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It could've been like, "I
fucking hate what you're doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Why are you copying me? Stop doing that," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or it could have been like, "Who are you?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or it could have been like, "Oh nice." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess, I didn't expect, I
don't know what I expected. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And when I met him, he
was super fucking nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was like, "Oh, you're
that fucking guy." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like jokingly.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was like, (exhales)
okay, he's cool about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, he invited me for
drinks and stuff and we met </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and yeah, one thing I
learned from him is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he is amazing at handling
the fans that come to him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh really?
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And just getting to like sit next to him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and watch him like talk to them and like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he just immediately changed
his atmosphere based </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on who he saw or who was coming near him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He just read people, like immediately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so, starting to copy like doing that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was rough at the
start but I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I've learned so much from him in just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how to compose yourself, how
to just be nice to people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing)
I'm just such an ass, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm kidding.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, not only did you copy his voice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you copied the way that you handled- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that he was so willing to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like help me out and teach
me things and he also like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just like trained you up like a prodigy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like there was a con that
I wasn't going to go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and he personally vouched
on my behalf and said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this guy's good, he was
like, "You need to get him." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like really nice guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Him and his husband Brandon are both some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of the nicest voice actors out there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean yeah, I was just about to say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, the way that Brandon and I kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of met online was a little like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You shitting on voice actors that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, not really,
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like a, so, to give context like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never met Brandon IRL
yet, but we follow each other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on Twitter and we've talked like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's one of the nicest
dudes I've ever met. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Such a nice guy.
- Really centered. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I can immediately
tell, incredibly intelligent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's like getting TikTok famous as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah I saw, I saw. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But, I did this video, I think
it was sometime this year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It was earlier this year, where
I asked my fans on Twitter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to send me videos of them
speaking in Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Asking questions about
Japanese, and then I respond </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like answer their question or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And one of the videos, was Brandon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was speaking in
the most perfect Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've ever heard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like his Japanese is actually perfect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And in the video he basically
asked, "So, I've seen videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of you in the past, kind
of shitting on dubs?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So he's a, Michael
and his husband are both </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> dub voice actors.
- They're both dub voicers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, they're both dub voice actors. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And Brandon used to be
a professional translator. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he was, so hence
why he's Japanese is so- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But in the video, in full Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, very, very
professional Japanese he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "So, you've kind of been
talking, ill heartedly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about dubs and dub voice actors. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, as a translator, I want to know, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what is the best, what
is a solution to that?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And immediately, in the video,
you can see immediately, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just like, "I'm so sorry." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He had like, Brandon
had that shit-eating grin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of like, I've completely won here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have taken the W, now
you must hand it to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember when I saw
that on Twitter I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Good Joey, you have to admit
that dubs are good now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So basically in the
video, I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Listen, it's not the
voice actors usually, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "it's the voice directors,"
I did that whole spiel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And luckily he was really
really cool about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know because he said
it in such a nice fashion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as well to me, I couldn't
help, but just being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay you know what?
I'll give you that one." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, you dropped this King,
I'll give it to you, all right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah but, yeah, he's, I'd
love to meet him IRL and- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, they're both super nice guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I mean the reason why I
speak so highly of them is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they've just been so nice to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so welcoming.
- Honestly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> every dub voice actor I've interacted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with, either IRL or not IRL
has been really, really nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me, considering the
fact that I had supposedly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> shit-talked a lot of top voice actors. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't been shit-talking
the voice actors, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just the product. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just the dubs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're just trying to
deflect the blame, Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing)
- Yeah, please, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I like you, but.
- Deflect, deflect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like you guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Ah, it's the director's fault." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Meets a director, "It
was the production team." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was the
production team's fault. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I meet the product- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was the audio software's fault. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a Dolby.
- It was no one's fault, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you just had a crunch time, that was it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I was deaf in one ear, clearly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember I was still
bitter for like two years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you said the,
watching Baccano! subbed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is better than dubbed, I was like, "What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, you're chatting out of your ass." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean I still stand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> by that point but,
- You're chatting out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> your ass man.
- (groaning) Oh God damn it! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Look, I'll say that it's better, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm not saying that the dub is bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The dub is good.
- The dub's better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The dub's better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's better, it's just better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nah.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Would you, like?
- Nah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What, no, it's just like.
- No, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's good but it's not better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like one of the
few dubs that's, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the few shows that
are better experienced </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in dubs, just because
of the setting and like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The reason why most anime
are better in Japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is 'cause, most of the time,
the setting matches Japanese, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but in Baccano! it's like,
it's in fucking 1930s America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We need to have.
- In my opinion, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was only one anime where the dub </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is far superior than the sub,
and that's Panty & Stocking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's obviously
because it doesn't even look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like an anime, it looks like a cartoon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think, at least for the notable ones, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Panty & Stocking, Baccano!, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Cowboy Bebop.
- Cowboy Bebop, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course.
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But Baccano! is like, I
watched the sub and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Look, this is shit."
- I'm not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no, listen.
- This is shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not shit! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is a shittier experience
compared to the dub. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is not shit, I'm not saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that the Baccano! dub is bad- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Going from Baccano! dub to sub is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you have like the premium,
triple-ply wipes at home </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and you go to the fucking
restroom, in like public </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like the sand paper </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> grading your.
- It's not that bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're all, it's like 1930s Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're all like Kawaii,
like some of the characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, mama!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, shut the
fuck up, sound American! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You're in 1930s America,
sound American, bitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know man, like look, listen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> To me it's like.
- We need to have you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> forcibly sit you down, and watch the dub </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like, enjoy it.
- I've seen the dub. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How much have you seen of the dub? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've seen it all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bullshit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes I have.
- No way, no way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Baccano! is one of my
fucking favorite anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of course I've seen the dub. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And also because you won't
shut the fuck up about the dub, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so I'm like, "All right, fine, I'll listen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to the fucking dub."
- I will not be not contend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until I watch you watching the dub. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna sit behind you being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Joey, appreciate this part.
- Fine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll do a reaction video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're on video, will
you please stop fighting? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll do a reaction video
to me watching the dub </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you can do a reaction
video to my reaction video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, how's that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean okay, here's another question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can we just get on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Can we just get on, please? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, can you name any of the characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you think are better
in the sub than the dub? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like which one do you think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like is there any dub characters in it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not particular
characters, it's just overall, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because maybe it's because
I did watch the sub first. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, maybe if
I watched the dub first, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> might be completely different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, like
Ladd Russo is like one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of my favorite dub
performances of all time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, yeah, it's like.
- Of all time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, of course, Ladd Russo
is fucking incredible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And he's good in sub, but I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I don't know maybe it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I understand the language. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It hit different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you, okay, I know it's.
- I'm just saying maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's because I understand the language, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I understand the
small little inflections </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that might go over a
lot of people's heads, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that I appreciate the sub a
lot more than most people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean you just, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Even just give me a two
second sample of the voices. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you listen to like the
gravel in Ladd's English voice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Baccano!, it's like god damn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> God damn!
- Okay but hold on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from your logic right,
you've only brought up Ladd. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, okay well, I think
Isaac and Miria are also better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think Isaac and Miria
sound the fucking same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> In the sud and dub.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fucking, in Japanese,
it's voiced by Cream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> from Sonic and it sounds
like Cream from Sonic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it doesn't sound right at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And, okay, also in the sub- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, but hold on a
second, if that voice actor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't do Cream from Sonic.
- No! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Then maybe you'd be like, "Okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is actually pretty good."
- No, because. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe it's all because
you only hear Cream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> from fucking Sonic the Hedgehog. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To anyone that hasn't watched this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't need to have watched it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but, like again, and also in the dub, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they cut out a lot of the
reaction noises like, ah, oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like a bunch of them,
which is fucking fantastic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I think it doesn't
suit Baccano! having the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor exclaims) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and fucking Miriam sounds like
fucking Cream the fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's it, the rabbit, that's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Nodding every two seconds? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she says, "Sukhoi" every
two seconds, it is so grading, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seeing an American 1930s person going, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with a Tommy gun going, "Sukhoi." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't mind.
- I hate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't mind it because
it's fucking anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh I, what did you
say one of the episodes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just cartoons, bro? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah it's just a Japanese
cartoon bro, chill the fuck out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, we all know that
someone has to get angry, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'll do it.
- Oh my God of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Every time dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every anime has to have that one faction </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of a toxic city right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought I cared
about the Baccano! dub, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I realized,
man maybe I don't care </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about the Baccano! dub.
- No, I really don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I really don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just think you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scientifically speaking,
it's, it's better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a Chinese cartoon
voiced in English, like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Chinese? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing)
- Just chill out there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Chinese? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> This man, this man's off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> goddammit.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What were we talking about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even know, we were, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we were talking, no, we were talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about our favorite people that we've met. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, we were talking about- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing)
- Not that that matters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why do we do this every time? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's okay, tangents are a
healthy part of conversation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not when it goes over to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> how did it go from fucking, oh
yes I love Jay Michael Tatum </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to fucking Cream, from Sonic the Hedgehog? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I felt like I could've
gone for a toilet break </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and just let you guys duke it out for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the last five minutes.
- Yeah, you could've. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you could've. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would've come out on top. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just passionate you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I just care about the things that I care, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which is not many things.
- What's the meme </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the softboard again, where it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love how Connor
interjects with an opinion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and thinks he's always right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey man- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And he doesn't let
anyone else talk about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I fucking hate when
I listen to a podcast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when it's like three people who are like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yes.
- You know yes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess you have a point, yeah, I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess I can understand where you're, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want someone who's like,
"Fuck you, you're wrong." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And it turns out, that
that person is completely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the wrong.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they're on there
like, "I don't give a shit." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't matter,
that's the last episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So what you're saying is you're playing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the villain.
- You're playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the antagonist again.
- You're playing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the antagonist again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, listen, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if I'm in the moment,
I'm gonna say what I say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with full confidence and
I'll go home later that day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'll be like, "I think
I was actually wrong, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually, fuck, I mean,
we've recorded it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Big regret.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I've talked to
you enough times to know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you do that so many
fucking times off the podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well, so I'm just like, you know what, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes I'll just let him have the candy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and just let him realize that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nah.
- Sometimes you do it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes you do it on the same day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, we would have a
conversation in the afternoon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then as we're having
drinks that night, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd be like, now that I think about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I might've been talking out of my ass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll totally realize
later, well, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, yeah, I was actually
completely in the wrong </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in that point but you know.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm glad that I said it
with confidence at least. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean look, the bottom line is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't take what we say all
that seriously all right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Take it with a grain of salt, all right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is three boys just
having a fucking laugh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I, (laughs), god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're not like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're not like an authority
or anything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I see a lot of people
who comment being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "I can't believe they misquoted something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or I can't believe they've
spread misinformation." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, no, this
is just three boys having </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a conversation that we
would have off camera. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is exactly how we talk off camera, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm sure you have conversations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with your friends all the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you've short absolute
shit out of your ass, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right?
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So if we say anything that's incorrect, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if I'm actually confident about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't take that (laughs).
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - In other words, don't
ever take us seriously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, if I'm
talking about something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that I am clearly like,
knowledgeable about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if I'm talking about
voice acting and I say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well I know my shit right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay fine, you can take my opinion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on it seriously.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, just like take what
we say with a grain of salt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes, we don't know
what we're talking about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I don't think there's
anything wrong with that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because a lot of people don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what the fuck they're talking about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and how we learn, is how we sometimes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you say stupid, stupid shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, all the time.
- And then we find out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we're wrong about it.
- And luckily we have, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, you guys to very
nicely remind us in the comments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how wrong we are.
- I don't give a fuck man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know that it's not
something that we've tailor, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, really sat there and thought, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, is that the correct thing to say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wait, have we done enough research? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hold on guys, let me check Wikipedia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> real quick.
- I'm talking out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of my ass and sometimes I'll say shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that is just like completely
wrong, and that's okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's.
- And we know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that its hilarious.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I just wanna preface
that, if we do say something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sure you can believe us, but
you should probably (laughs), </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, if you really
wanna take our word for it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe check on your own as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't like quote us on any
thesis or anything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because this is not the type </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of show.
- I mean half the episodes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have alcohol, you know
what I mean, it's probably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That says a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Would you trust an opinion of someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a bar being like, "No, no, no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the engineering is structurally sound." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Sips the cocktail, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, it's great, you know.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is why we have guests
on who can actually know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have like, are knowledgeable
in situations where we are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and where we're not just
like talking out of our ass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and we would, we would just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Put us in our place.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> put us in our place basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, normally when
we're talking off camera, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we might pull out our phone and be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "No Connor, you're actually wrong." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I'll double down and be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "No, I don't trust that."
- Yeah, I don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't care what Wikipedia has to say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I'm right, therefore I am. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Facts and opinions, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> facts and logic, sorry.
- I know some people hate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like I'll be like,
"No, fuck you anyway." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But I (laughs)- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I find it fucking hilarious because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just, at the end of
the day, as much of it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a dichotomy, right,
'cause this is a show, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but at the same time, it's like, to us, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of not a show, it's
like we just talk, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But we are putting on a
show, but we talk like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the exact same way off show.
- I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't feel like we act
any differently off camera. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, yeah.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We just have a microphone in our face, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the only difference, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And cameras on us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I care about my angle, okay, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, sometimes I purposely lead Connor on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the shit that he's saying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like weirdly
heartwarming, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of the same feeling as like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me being a dad and my
five-year-old, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to convince me that
Santa Claus is real, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing)
All right, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, he comes down the chimney, does he? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm more than happy to
waste my energy in shouting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at you and telling you.
- Oh, he comes down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the chimney, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Cookies and milk? Okay, okay.
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I see, I see. Tell me more, please. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Man, you're leading me on.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but what the fuck
were we talking about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh yeah, people we'd like to meet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [In Unison] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What about, what about
other stuff that we do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing)
- Why, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We did have a topic in mind.
- Well, we did have a topic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in mind before we moved on to this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, really.
- And we just wanna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> break into it, 'cause we're
getting close to the hour mark, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we discussed beforehand that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we have the Lost Episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is probably gonna go down in history </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as some kind of fabled legend of- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, people will be
like, "Whoa, what's that-" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's actually a shame 'cause
I thought it was genuinely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a fucking great episode.
- It was a great episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, I'm sure we've
mentioned on other episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we recorded an episode, and
for some reason the audio </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stopped recording 10 minutes in, so, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> completely unusable and we
refused to use the camera audio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It sounds like shit.
- It sounded like dog shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, I
don't even wanna make it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this a patron exclusive.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we now have a system in place
where the audio is fine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so that'd not happen, but
we spoke about fandoms </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we are, aren't too fond of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I know this is gonna be a like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's like, everyone's getting there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which, what am I a fandom of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not like that, not just
openly shitting on fandoms, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> although there was some of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Although we are gonna.
- Yeah, we are going to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we are going to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like how we made the previous segment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like perfectly, perfectly
segue into this segment, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where we're just gonna
shit on everything, and- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, what are we gonna talk about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> after talking about the people we love? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh yeah, the people we fucking hate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Listen, I know that fandoms
in general are not represented </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by the minority annoyance
that is in the forefront. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes of course.
- It is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it is the vocal
- But. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Minority that are probably
what we are talking about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is just us joshing
around and chatting shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is what we see, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> This is just what we see.
- So Dragon Ball fans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't get offended, okay.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> We're not (laughs). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go on, well.
- If you like Dragon Ball, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you are the worst.
- You are the. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What are you doing?
Why are you a Dragon- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey imitates spitting)
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - As a Monkeybrain, I
should be a giant fan of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay no, okay I'll start with,
Dragon Ball fandom scares </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> me the most out of any fandom.
- No, because. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why is that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe it's 'cause I
understand the JoJo fandom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm in the, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> behind the scenes.
- Which is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we'll get to the JoJo fandom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we'll get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to the JoJo fandom.
- We'll get to that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we'll get to that right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I'm sure everyone's
gonna be thinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that immediately, but like,
the Dragon Ball Fandom, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like, I feel like it's so separate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from every other anime fandom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whereas JoJo fans normally
watch a bit of anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah okay, they're a bit annoying
and what not and whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But Dragon Ball fans, I feel like a ton </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of them only watch Dragon Ball. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you mean seasonal anime? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There was no Dragon Ball in that season, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't give a fuck.
- Do you mean seasonal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> new season of Dragon Ball? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah (laughs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Reruns of Dragon Ball Z? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, okay, I mean this is
just like, outside looking in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I'm sure we're chatting
out our ass half the time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but like, my God, are they
aggressive online about like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and also the YouTube
scene scares me so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Dragon Ball YouTubers are- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just (laughs), I'm sorry I spat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I just had a flash-back to that thumbnail. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You have to explain that.
- Do you wanna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> explain that thumbnail?
- You have to explain that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I was on Twitter- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Peak content on YouTube.
- Oh my God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm pretty sure it's like parody, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and if it's not, it's parody.
- Yeah, I hope, I hope it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like if, no matter what, it's
parody 'cause I either laugh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it is parody or I
laugh 'cause it's not parody. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I follow like Justin Wang on Twitter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's the guy that talks
about like internet law </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he retweets the most
fucking cursed shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And so it was just a thumbnail </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was like, "What would happen?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like, "What if
Vegeta got coronavirus, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was tested coronavirus positive?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "This can't be real." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, it was just a
thumbnail, so I searched it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was a two-part series of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what if Vegeta got the coronavirus? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "what, what is this?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What was the other part? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was part two, just part
two, I didn't wanna watch it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there was another
one where it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What if Goku tested HIV positive?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, (laughs)
what is Dragon Ball YouTube? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I only watched the first five minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was pretty sure it was parody, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't tell, but it was
very, like, dry delivery. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I need to watch the rest of
it, that probably get a nice- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nice, bring some views.
- I need to watch that video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause the thing
about the Dragon Ball fandom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that it feels like
the Dragon Ball fandom, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, you can be
obviously a Dragon Ball fan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and an anime fan, but I feel
like there are just as many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Dragon Ball fans who are
just Dragon Ball fans, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they like watch nothing
else but Dragon Ball. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's kind of like being
like, just like an MCU fan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. (laughs)
- You call yourself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like a comics fan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's weird 'cause like
the Dragon Ball videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I'm just going based
off like what I've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on YouTube, just pure anecdotal stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Those Dragon Ball videos come
out as often if not more often </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than most anime YouTuber videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and get more views or the same views. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- And so that must mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right, that like, again
this is just me like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking like, aliens,
like you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, surely the fandom
is fucking gigantic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It has to be.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like, I don't know man- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or it's like a really small group </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of super dedicated people who are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I need to watch this for the 20th time." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And people are so into it man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I don't understand
the videos that are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What if Vegeta fought a fucking Luffy?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "What is
that? Who gives a shit?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's going
from like Dragon Ball fan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to like Shonen fandom as a whole, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> which also exists in this
like, it's own little bubble, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But I don't understand that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's not just Shonen fandom, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's Shonen action fandom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not like the Shonen romance fandom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or the Shonen harem fandom,
'cause there's like lots </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of different types of Shonen, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's specifically Shonen, like
power fantasy battle harem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean, like
the whole fandom, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that's all, it's the Naruto's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the Bleach, it's the One Piece. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Although, I feel One Piece
is kind of separate from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything else.
- Yeah, One Piece </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is on its own.
- It's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One Piece is separate,
Dragon Ball is separate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then, Naruto and Bleach are separate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you have like,
just like the general like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, and then the Seven Deadly Sins fanbase </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is separate as well.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This video is sponsored by Mack Weldon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Mack Weldon is better than whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're wearing right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For example, Garnt is
wearing Mack Weldon right now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are the fabrics premium Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They are the most premium-este fabrics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I've ever.
- Thank you so much Garnt, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I appreciate that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Mack Weldon believes in
smart design, premium fabrics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and simple shopping, I have to say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I ordered the stuff myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was pretty simple to use. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Mack Weldon will be
the most comfortable underwear, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> socks, shirts, under shirts,
hoodies and sweatpants, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and more that you will ever wear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They have a line of
Silver underwear and shirts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are naturally anti-microbial, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which means that they eliminate odor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They want you to be comfortable, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so if you don't like your
first pair of underwear, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can keep it, and they
will still refund you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No questions asked, you can
keep your smelly underwear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Not only does Mack
Weldon's underwear, socks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and shirts look good,
they perform well too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's good for working out, going to work, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going out on dates, just everyday life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did work out in the shorts
at the gym, can confirm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did go out with this
beautiful Mack Weldon beanie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was very comfortable and wholesome. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> in my cosplay videos, and you bet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your ass you'll be seeing them soon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I actually got something
a little bit different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I got the beanie, but I also got the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Mack Weldon face mask as well.
- Yeah, dude, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is perfect for this time- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't think to get the

<SPEAKER_02> - Thank you to Mack Weldon for

<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, let's whip out the old boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This conversation
requires alcohol. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You brought up Seven Deadly Sins, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do wanna talk a lot about that later. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We'll get into, we'll get
into the Seven Deadly Sins. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're just gonna go through
all the fucking Shonens, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> aren't we?
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, Dragon Ball
Twitter is the fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every time I see a shitty take- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Starting off strong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, you just see the
dumbest fucking take, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's always from a fucking
Dragon Ball amateur. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Or like someone who like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just tweets about Dragon Ball. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause I remember seeing
like so many shitty takes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I remember seeing this
one tweet that was like talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about how Vegeta was like the
greatest antihero ever written </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in anime or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there was like, the comment thread </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was like more hilarious
than the take itself, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think my favorite
meme was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Goku going Super Saiyan,
and he was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the top text was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Don't fuck with Dragon Ball fans." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the bottom text was,
"We only know one anime." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's true though, what is it about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is it about Dragon Ball fans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that only watch Dragon Ball? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like everything they consume, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know they're a Dragon
Ball fan when they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "ah, but GG wasn't that bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs)
Was it, like?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you see the tweet that was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You know Goku didn't protest." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you serious? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it was like,
"Vegeta didn't protest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They just got it done." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, oh my
god, read the room, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Read the room.
- Oh my god. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was so funny, the replies
were like, "bro, it's anime." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like they're fucking delusional, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my god, what is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've always wanted to know, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I don't personally know
anyone who's in that fandom, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but I've always been interested </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in meeting someone IRL
who's in that fandom, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I just have so many- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, you'll know, 'cause
they're the fucking loudest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ones at their conventions.
- Yeah, true, true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're the ones in the corner, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> playing like fucking.
- Fucking charging up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Trying to be Super Saiyan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you ever hear someone go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor shouts)
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know who they are.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, I've always just wanted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to ask them being like, why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why, no, it's like
that meme of the fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the woman in the car, it's
like, "Why are you like this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, why are you like this?
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what like, who
conditioned you to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's so much good anime
out there, I'm aware. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yes One Piece, I am aware of that show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Naruto, Bleach, I'm aware of all of these. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, Goku is my bae.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I will only follow his story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so weird right,
'cause it's like, I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what I see in the Shonen fandom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like everything is like
a dick measuring contest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you got a fucking sim
for your fucking characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're gonna, you're gonna
defend them no matter what. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's (laughs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like what? I don't understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I guarantee, compared to like some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of these Dragon Ball fans, like dude, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't even think Toriyama
is as big of a Dragon Ball fan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing)
as fucking Dragon Ball fans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, at least Toriyama was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I mean I like Dragon Ball but like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like Dragon Quest as well you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, I've got all these other things." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Meanwhile, Dragon Ball fans are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Toriyama, god, I love you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do more Dragon Ball please." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Too fair, that's classic me with JoJo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do more, do more of that.
- Yeah, but at least </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Araki's only done JoJo.
- True, and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not shouting about it all the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah of course.
- I'm just like secretly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> thinking about it.
- Are you sure about that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing)
- Not all the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not all the time.
- Are sure about that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Gentlemen, it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the time.
- Are you sure about that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So when Connor.
- We'll get into that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll get into that.
- Okay, we'll get into that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> We'll get into that.
- We'll get into JoJo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'm willing to talk about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got some shit to say, but no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like sticking with the Dragon
Ball and Shonen fandom, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to me it feels like the
fucking ghetto right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because.
- Ghetto of the anime fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ghetto of the anime fans.
- Because like, they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it feels like they're
constantly having gang wars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with each other and
you're just sitting here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching this like, take place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on Twitter.
- You're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the suburban white couple. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, no, no, I don't.
- You're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the suburban white couple
going into the ghetto, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that are just like, "You
don't belong here, do you?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just watching this feud
go on on Twitter being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (table thumps) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Liverwood beat, Leaf would
beat fucking Goku in a fight," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like this shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, well, One Piece fans are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Cool, I guess, like
I don't fucking care." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like what? Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why do you care? Why does? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why does the Dragon Ball fanbase want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to give Goku like this amazing KD ratio? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like other anime fans.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just had this amazing flashback. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You remember the time when
One Punch Man came out? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like for some fucking reason,
there were so many videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like, "Who will win, Goku </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or Saitama?"
- Or Saitama, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my god!
- And like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you dare say an opinion, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> get ready to get fucking
destroyed by either fandom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, what was even worse than that was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you remember when like Death Battle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> did Goku versus Superman? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my god!
- And that got so toxic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that they had to redo it,
to give the same results! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing)
(Connor clapping) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Imagine being, like caring that much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about some fictional fan fight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, this is literally
like four writers in a room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are like, "I think Goku would win." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And people are like, "I can't believe it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't make sense of
this, my day is ruined." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do they even watch the show? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You would know if you saw
the size of Goku's nipples </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that there is no way he
would lose in a fight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not possible. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like it's insane,
it's actually insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, and I don't understand
because I've never cared </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that much about something
in my life, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have been in like university, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've had my YouTube channel
completely demonetized, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's all my income, and
I cared less about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I cared a lot, I
obviously didn't wanna go broke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's one thing though that
the Dragon Ball fanbase that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I'm pretty sure,
I'm quite correct on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And just shocks me, is
that I guaran-fucking-tee, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that 99% of the like,
hardcore Dragon Ball fans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably didn't even watch
the first Dragon Ball. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They started from zero. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a controversial take, Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guarantee.
- That's an assumption Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's an assumption, but
I'm willing to bet on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every Dragon Ball fan is
now gonna come up and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, excuse me, I watched.
- Yeah, they've watched it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You've given them fuel now Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean if you have, good on you but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is, it is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm gonna say something
that has completely no basis, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatsoever.
- Okay. Go on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the Dragon Ball
fans are one bad day away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from being furries, there, I said it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing)
Okay, there, I said it, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think they are, I think
they act in the same way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that furries do in sometimes, there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, isn't Goku a monk? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- As somebody, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as somebody who was a very angry child, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know exactly where
that anger's coming from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know where it's coming from.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's a jump into the pit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just saying man, that (laughs), </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they're one bad forum click away, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's all (laughs).
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're one bad YouTube
recommendation away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from like falling down
in that rabbit hole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're gonna get fucking
destroyed in this episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh my god! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Good thing we're fucking drunk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs)
- Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, but what do you mean Garnt? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had like four sips, what do you- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just take some sips,
just take some sips. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's gonna get worse, the
more like, the more we drink. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that my parents didn't love me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as much as the fans love Goku. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll be honest, all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I don't know what that
says about my parents, but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, your parents loved
you fine, I'm sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - My parents would not defend
me on a comment section. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no.
- Very aggressively. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They'd be like, "This on you, Connor." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just imagine now like, what
if Goku was an actual person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and he just saw all the comments? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What if Goku, has Goku
committed war crimes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do we know if Goku's done that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Would they defend Goku? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, we know what would
happen if he was HIV positive, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right, but we don't know.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But we don't know what would happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's great
that Goku is advocating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for HIV awareness.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's great, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> More power to him, you know, I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if that's in the agenda- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have to start a parody series now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I just go through every
show and then protagonist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and just go into hypothetical situations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of if they were HIV positive.
- What if Saitoma had (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> syphilis? (laughs)
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Would Saitoma be able to punch syphilis? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, would he be able to
punch the syphilis off his dick? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean okay, I love to
clout on Dragon Ball fans, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they are like the
brick wall of opinions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- It's like it doesn't matter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what you say, it's just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We can't take you seriously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean it's because most of the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they're arguing a point
that can't be proved anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's all like situational, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because who cares about power levels? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause you can't really
argue about power levels, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unless you watch Death Battle, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And people still disagree with that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, even then, it's
like, if there's no basis. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even if you put science into it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people are gonna like, rep
the shit no matter what, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I mean?
- Yeah, exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like a fucking religion, you know- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is a religion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I know.
- It's like a cult, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a cult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the cult of Dragon
Ball, that's exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what it feels like.
- Dragon Ball fans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> watching this be like, "Shit."
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh shit, they're onto us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just a level of excitement
that I've never felt for, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or like passion that I've
never felt for anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if that means
that I'm lacking in something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my life, but then I see
how passionate they are, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, I'm kind of
glad that I have hobbies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Other than Dragon Ball. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm glad I have other
things that I can like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> put my time and energy.
- It can be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> go read gay porn, Connor, like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How many burns can we
get on like one episode? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
(Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like don't get me wrong,
like I'm sure all three of us, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> love Dragon Ball right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like we grew up with that shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of course it's fucking epic, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but we like other things.
- Oh wait no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I never grew up on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh you didn't? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because I was
always so fucking confused </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at what was happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, that's right, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, how were you confused? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> What was confusing about it?
- When I was a kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would watch a fight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the next episode
was them like talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before the fight.
- Yeah, we talked about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a previous episode.
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was completely out
of order so I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna watch.
- That's fair, that's fair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- But I mean like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I mean, you know,
it is a very inoffensive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> show right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right.
- Because it's hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to hate Dragon Ball. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel.
- Okay, like okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love the charm of Dragon Ball. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- I love the mainstream, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like everyone knows Dragon Ball. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- And, dude, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're listening to a rap song, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you hear like a Dragon
Ball reference as an anime fan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like, "What?"
- Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's Akrillon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even know who
that is, but that's cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because what I don't understand is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how Dragon Ball is still, I guess, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as loved as it is because, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's got such as huge
pop and like mainstream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> referencing power.
- Yeah, because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love Dragon Ball Z, but my god, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I could not watch Dragon Ball Z today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No way.
- It has not aged well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> at all in terms like the
pacing and everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remembered like trying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to watch the newest Dragon Balls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I can't even remember
the fucking name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's the new Dragon Ball? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Super?
- Dragon Ball Super, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember trying
to watch like Inako too, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was just exactly
the same as Dragon Ball Z. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like slightly faster paced- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, just cleaner line-up right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like my god, like
I don't know how this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how there are still so
many passionate fans, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> whereas like Naruto fans, they saw Boruto, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and were like, "Fuck that
shit, Boruto fucking sucks." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whereas Dragon Ball fans are here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> repping Dragon Ball Super, where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's an okay show you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's-
- You're gonna get flamed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for that one dude.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How dare he just said it was okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was okay, it was- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I feel like
Dragon Ball is a fandom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is just like, where
the creators are just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I guess just give them
the same thing again? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Slightly different,
Goku has blue hair now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that correct? Am I saying- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he can go Super
Saiyan black now as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, is that the clip where they say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Don't shoot, he's black?"
- I'm sorry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he's the strongest.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In the universe now,
how can we up that up? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Multi-verse.
- Yeah multi-verse, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's have a tournament
arc, but we get the lord </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of each universe to fight,
and then they become, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm pretty sure that's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if I'm wrong, I'm sorry.
- Like, I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It sounds really fucking cool on paper. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, it's the reason why
I think God of High School </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is kind of mad, it's
like it's all just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a dick-measuring contest, like you said. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And after a certain point you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> damn, Rent-A-Girlfriend's
story is kind of good though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you know what I mean like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you kind of just need something more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right.
- It needs more Waifu's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not even Waifu's, just some substance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure the fans would argue it does, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but for me, it just doesn't,
and I'm sorry Dragon Ball fans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm openly shitting on you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what you're into, I get it dude, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm into some weird shit.
- You're not sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like, he's not sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I like Dragon Ball as you kid.
- You can shit on my stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dragon Ball wasn't my fucking childhood, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but growing up, I still
hold it close to my heart, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I can't watch that shit, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't have the patience to go through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what I did as a kid, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's what I
find interesting, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that like, this kind of super, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> super committed Dragon Ball fan base, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't exist in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> There aren't people today who are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hyper committed to Dragon
Ball or Dragon Ball Super </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything Dragon Ball related. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now, here, than there
are people like in America </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and like overseas.
- I hear you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> see that much of it.
- You don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, it's normally, like
they'll have a section for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like there are people,
like Dragon Ball here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least in Japan now, is just kind of put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in the Hall of Fame of
like, this is an anime that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone knows.
- Everyone knows. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everybody knows, it's
like Naruto, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- It's like Naruto, Bleach, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Dragon Ball, they're all finished series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Their TV anime is finished,
their manga is finished. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're in the Hall of Fame, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you like it, cool,
you'll hear it in passing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it isn't like, I have
committed my entire life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to wondering if, what would
happen if Goku was HIV positive? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need to know.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You're not gonna get that here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just realized the irony
of me getting very defensive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about the Baccano! dub
and then me just shitting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on them, right?
- Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally two minutes later- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Toxic (imitates spitting). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can get fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you like Dragon Ball.
- Hypocrite, hypocrite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hypocrite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hey, if you wanna
defend it, that's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I just think it's funny to
like (laughs) joke about shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can shit on one I
like, it's totally fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like speaking, but like speaking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of super addicted fan bases, like I'm, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I used to think that way
about the Naruto fan base. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, because I was never
in the Naruto fan base. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I never got into Naruto as
much as other people did, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but as you said, the
moment Boruto dropped, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the Naruto fans are like, "Naruto, me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Naruto, no, no. What
are you talking about?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, excuse me, I'm a Naruto fan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna watch fucking Boruto. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't want a Boruto video,
but I watch a 50 minute video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on why Naruto's power scaling is the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> perfectly balanced thing in existence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I see a lot of those videos
pop up on my recommended </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that are like, Naruto, what's
his fucking, some character </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know like
Madara, is that his name? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah
- That character. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And it'd be like, I remember there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a 90-minute video on my
recommended that was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Why his power was the best." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "This is 90 minutes long?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Dude, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is insane.
- Yeah, they go through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> every single scenario of Madara, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right?
- And it's cool, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I think it's great that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I imagine, I mean like,
when I see a JoJo video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's super in depth I'm
like, "That's fucking sick." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then I'm from the outside
looking in, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Whoa, that seems so excessive." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- But I guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's really fucking awesome
if you're in the fandom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but you can say that
about any fandom, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What like, I don't understand is how, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> how a lot of the fandom still
has like so much momentum- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's strange.
- Even like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after the series has ended,
'cause you normally think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of an anime series, after it ends, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like this cool-off period. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that does.
- And then it kinda, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goes, into like memory and everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but with a lot.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of like the biggest Shonen
titles, even if they've ended- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's weird, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's really weird.
- Yeah, like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm genuinely like curious
how they've been able </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to maintain that momentum- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'm jealous, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> how do you keep coming
up with this content? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. (laughs)
- Like I can't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Naruto YouTubers, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I admire it, man, like I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the fact that you can still
keep an audience going. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's honestly like admirable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause most of the time
they just talk about the show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like, 'cause.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and like the audience that just
does not lose that passion, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> no matter how much time has passed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no matter how many new
series has come out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they still are like will consume </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all this stuff.
- Yeah, it's insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where there's like no
new media coming out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause the manga ended, like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like four, five years ago or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a long time ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which one are we talking about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Naruto?
- Naruto. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- It was a while ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's funny because
all of the Naruto videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen are just on like
the Naruto segment part. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Nobody's talking about Boruto. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one's talking about Boruto. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one gives a shit about Boruto. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I like those kinds of videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think, okay going back to Dragon Ball, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just had a fucking flashback. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember this one channel,
I don't know what it's called. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm sorry if you're watching this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was a guy who made fights </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> between Dragon Ball characters and his OC. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this channel had like tons of videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it had like 200 K subs I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "This is insane." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like people, thousands
of people are watching, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a dude's OC fight Dragon Ball characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I couldn't.
- Why is that so funny? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, I can kind of, I can understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> why you might be interested
in a death battle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> between, I mean I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's cool.
- Two known characters? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, that's cool, you
wanna see the outcome? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You wanna?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But, when it's someone's OC. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, my mind was blown. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, wait, people are into this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> This is how desperate people
are for Dragon Ball content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like-
- That's so funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll give the Naruto people props, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at least they have like, the majority </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the content that seems
to be doing really well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the content that is like,
50 minute analysis videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is like, I'm sure you
love that if you're into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But, you know.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I find it, like
what's more entertaining </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than the content itself, for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is watching people react to the content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God!
- Because it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay so, I remember I did
like an AniTube rewind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and people were like, asking me why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I put like Double4anime
in the AniTube rewind- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause he's the legend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because, how are you not entertained </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching a shirtless dude
scream his fucking ass off, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching Goku versus Cigna? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What was it, like it was Naruto versus? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Naruto versus Goku, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it was Naruto
versus Ichigo maybe? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Something like that.
- Yeah, something like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it was Naruto versus Ichigo,
and he was just shirtless, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> screaming his ass off- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - He wasn't shirtless,
he wasn't shirtless, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> he didn't have a shirt on, but
he had this massive scarf on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for some reason.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Without a shirt, I'm like,
that's an interesting fashion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> statement.
- Yeah, like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How is this not entertaining to you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I respect that man, that
sounds like great content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was fucking, 'cause I found out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about that video through the
AniTube rewind and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I have to go watch this video." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing)
So I found it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I watched the entire
thing and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "This was the best
entertainment this entire week." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it's so hilarious,
just, he was screaming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> at the top of his voice, like
a fucking 10-year-old girl. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so excited by the
fact that Naruto won. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like damn, I wish I
could get that excited </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about a fucking death battle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's so admirable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wish I could get that
excited about anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Man, I feel like Naruto fans are just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like toned down Dragon
Ball fans to some extent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're not near as bad.
- I feel like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in terms of like, passion and
like the the cultness of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is what I'm gonna call I guess, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like, Dragon Ball
is definitely up there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> at the top of just
passionate, dedicated fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think every anime fanbase is just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a toned-down version of
the Dragon Ball fanbase. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think Dragon Ball is
by far the most aggressive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and like-
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is what we want- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's funny because like,
Dragon Ball is pretty much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as close to a mainstream
anime as you can get. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But there's a difference between people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who know Dragon Ball, and
people who are anime fans, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who also grew up with Dragon Ball, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then just Dragon Ball fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then people who are Dragon Ball. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like you know, 'cause there'll be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the gym wearing some
Goku shit or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah of course.
(Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yo, bench press me.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The fucking Goku, Goku under-armor- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just realized the perfect analogy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the dragon Dragon Ball fandom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just, if tyler1 was a fandom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dammit, I love tyler1 though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing)
(Joey yells) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so true though. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wouldn't be surprised if
tyler1 is a Dragon Ball fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He likes anime.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tyler1, come on the podcast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and talk to us about anime.
- Please come on with us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my god! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We need the Monkeybrain here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's so interesting, I
find, I guess the difference </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> between these massive
Shonen fanbases, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because even though, because for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't hear about the
Bleach fanbase anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, on YouTube you see some of those- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know about that one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, I don't see it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, the Bleach fans are
like the kid in the corner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who you're worried might like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bring something sketchy into school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, did he bring a knife? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna see some Bankai's
goddammit. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's the Bleach fans, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the ones who sit in the back of the class </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're like, they said
they were gonna bring a knife </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, should I be concerned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that he's gonna do it?
- Yeah (laughs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like that's the Bleach fans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't worry, it's a knife
that I haven't Bonkai'd yet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause when Bleach, like, I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I liked Bleach up to like
the, I think past the- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Aizen arc?
- Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> To like the Soul Society.
- I don't know much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about Bleach, but I know the
Soul Society arc is garbage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, no, no, no.
- The Soul Society is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the best.
- The Soul Society is good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, which one's the
one that's a bad arc? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Aizen arc, which is.
- Okay, that's the one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I hear about it all the time.
- After the Soul Society arc. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, Bleach fans
are also very passionate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about their show, but I remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when the new anime got announced, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I mean, I liked Beach at the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I kind of fell
out of love with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like when the new
animate got announced, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "I don't know why, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm pretty fucking hyped man." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm hyped for this.
- Same, same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Honestly same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess 'cause it
could be like that kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of thing of like, all right,
well I was like a teenager </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I enjoyed this, a young adult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, oh, I need to get that back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That excitement. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But, when that anime got announced, man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all of the Bleach fandom,
they'd been like holed up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they suddenly, they
all rose up together. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Rise up, rise up.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They all came out of their bunkers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're like, "Is it safe to leave? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Finally? Is the fallout over?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you go to like normies, and like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you just have like normal people be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like taking off their shirts and like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yes, I was a Bleach fan all along." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing)
"Yes." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I read all of it,
I've seen all the anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Join me and mosh.
- They're all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like the Peter Parker Superman,
where they're just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yes, I'm a Bleach fan." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like what other, 'cause
like I'm thinking, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So there's the Dragon Ball fanbase, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which we've already established. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The Naruto fanbase, Bleach fanbase. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What other one would there be? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, obviously the JoJo fans base. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think, another Shonen
fandom that is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the little shit brother is
the Seven Deadly Sins fandom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're like the little runt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, "Dude, no one
gives a shit about you." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Stop fucking making noise." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey claps) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Dude, it's a shame 'cause like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I actually really enjoyed
Seven Deadly Sins. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- I wasn't a fan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't give a shit about it, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought it was pretty like
epic, turn your brain off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> monkeybrain, don't focus, entertainment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it was that perfect,
like Shonen white noise. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> The way that I thought
that the other Shonens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were a bit too boring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- It's weird, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because Seven Deadly
Sins is the one Shonen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I really, really tried to get into. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean like, I think Seven
Deadly Sins has been the show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I've tried to get into
the most that I just couldn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've given it four chances. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Four, and I still can't- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What turned you off to it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just the fact that
there wasn't any like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in season one at least,
because I haven't gone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> past season one, there wasn't any doubt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that the heroes were like.
- Meliodas would win, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That like Meliodas or whoever was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the heroes team would win. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's true.
- Because in season one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the only threat to the main characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are the main characters,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And, I don't know, like I get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that everyone is so
ridiculously overpowered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's like kinda
the charm of the series, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I just couldn't get past that point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm just like, "Man,
why am I watching this fight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when I know that there's not
even like a hint of a threat." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- See, I didn't even get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to that point, like I just look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the Seven Deadly Sins
fanbase and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not putting my foot
into that mine field man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I watched everything
up until the new season, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> episode one, then I was like, "No." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then after that when
you saw the fucking GIF, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like when you saw the
fight between Meliodas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and Escanor, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Ooh, it feels bad to
be a Seven Deadly Sins </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fan, doesn't it."
- I'm not gonna lie, when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I saw the clip of that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on Twitter.
- Oh my god, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my god.
- Where people were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This has to be fan made." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I fucking lost it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I lost it but I was also like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "I kind of wanna watch it." (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you don't know, Seven Deadly Sins, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> super popular show and
then they handed it off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to which studio was it, Da, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dean, no, no.
- It was Dean, I think it was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They handed off to Studio Dean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it ended up looking like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> This is one of the stills. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I know you shouldn't judge the stills- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think we've talked about this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on like the very first episode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of the podcast.
- No, no, we didn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's from the lost episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, okay.
- Was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it was from the lost episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even remember, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I thought like, I
think I mentioned something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about it must suck to be
a Seven Deadly Sins fan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing)
Because you just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It does.
- At least, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're Dragon Ball fan,
you get good animation, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the Seven Deadly Sins anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll just play like one second
of animation, here you go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It looks fucking god-awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can go onto YouTube,
there's tons of clips of just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the entire Meliodas.
- It's embarrassing, like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And Escanor fight is fucking hilarious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And when I first watched that episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like season three, I think it is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like just please say psych. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, please say psych, like
the whole 20 minutes was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Please say psych." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just be like, and now it's
time for the real animation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - JK, this was the animatic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like "No, no!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I thought it was good enough right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Man, the fans, I didn't
realize how like out there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they were online, like they
are like hardcore about- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't know how popular
Seven Deadly Sins was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh it's really fucking popular. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't know how
popular it was until like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I kind, it was kind of
the series that I thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was just like, gonna fade into obscurity, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then the more years
passed, the more popular it got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the more things I heard
about it and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, I didn't know where these
fans were when the series </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> started 'cause maybe I
was just fucking blind." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't know it was this
popular when it started. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Easily though, the worst part </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of Seven Deadly Sins is
the fucking main character, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Meliodas.
- Yeah, really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've heard that.
- I cannot fucking stand him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've heard that the entire time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause this whole
character's thing is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "He he, I'm OP and also I-" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I touch women.
- I touch women </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's charming, and it's like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yikes.
- And it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know who is this appealing to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm watching this and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm over the age of 18." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I like, I don't understand
who this is charming to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well clearly to people
who have never touched women </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in their life right? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just saying.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I'm sitting there
and I'm literally just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Am I losing my mind or am I
the only one who hates this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, because I remember
when I first watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Seven Deadly Sins, I
actually made the tweet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where like, I remember
watching the first episode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I remember thinking,
"Man, what can we do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to give Meliodas like a
quirky, like a quirky quirk." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like the anime quirk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Let's just make him accidentally
touch women's breasts." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Make him a molester, molester. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, molester, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm like, you know,
I'm like totally against </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> work culture and everything
but I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not enough for me to
like turn me off the anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or turn me off like the entire thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But at the same time, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Couldn't you have thought of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> couldn't we think of something better?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, again, like you said,
I am not all for being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "You can't do that," I'm
like, "I don't give a shit." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, every time it happened on screen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like when you've got a whiff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of a really disgusting fart,
you're like, "Oh, fuck!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "God, really?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, "Who's that
cat girl in fucking-" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, in Fire Force right?
- Fire Force, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Who's the cat girl?
- The one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that keeps getting naked? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's her entire quirk? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I've never been so
turned off by fan service </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my entire life until I
watched Fire Force, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God.
- It's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it needs to be tasteful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like as a full-blown degenerate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fire Force is the first
time I've actually watched, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, I've actually
seen full on fan service </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and been like, "Why does
this need to be here?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - This doesn't matter,
get this outta here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Seriously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right in front of my salad? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like, you'd have this
really cool looking fight, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, I'm invested
in this fight, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I love, I love that.
- Just dropped out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love my fucking fan service, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but just don't put it
in front of my fights. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like did they expect to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay this fight scene's
gonna go for 10 minutes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but we know the audience
isn't gonna pay attention. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> All right, it's been five minutes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> quick, drop a titty,
drop a titty right now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My problem with it is
that you take a break </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> from the fight to look at
the fan service, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, I hate that 'cause
that disrupts the flow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the fight, if the fan
service was like separate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the flights, like in something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like High School of the Dead, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where, something like
High School of the Dead, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where like.
- I don't know man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fan service and fights are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> oh come on, you didn't like the fights </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in High School?
- No, I love the fights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, there's iconic scenes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in there.
- Yeah, exactly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where the fan service is just
like a part of the fight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That fucking great.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> High School of the Dead did it right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's like, we're gonna
dedicate an entire episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to just the raunchiest
fucking fan service. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No action whatsoever, so
you know what it's gonna be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then we're gonna get right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> into the fight the next episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but if you like
take a break from the fight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to look at the fan service, it's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that eye-rolling moment where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if you fucking love fan service </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have no fucking problem with it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it still disrupts the fucking fight, so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why I just couldn't get into like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, there's a lot of reasons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't get into Fire Force. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was one of the reasons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's a shame, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you know.
- David Productions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking killed it.
- David Production did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> such a good job on the
animation, and like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the art design and the character
designs are fucking cool, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Massive Soul Eater you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm a massive
Soul Eater fan as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - As a massive Soul Eater fan all right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm just like hell yeah,
new Soul Eater basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in 2020 but with a lot of fire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's like Fire
Force is one of those shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I've really, really
wanted to fucking like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but for some reason I just
could not get into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I'm same.
- I got like four episodes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in and I was like, I'm pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay.
- Yeah, three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or four episodes was my limit.
- I think my problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with it was I felt like
a mid-2000s Shonen, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where Shonen has like evolved past that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like My Hero
Academia and Black Clover </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have taken like, what has worked, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and put their own twist on it
and then evolved onto that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> whereas Fire Force feels
like it still belongs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 10 years ago with better animation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mentioning, My Hero Academia, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's got a pretty notorious one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now I don't know, now I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If this is a result of it just being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the most mainstream anime
right now, probably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I imagine a lot of it has to do with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think so.
- But, there's a lot of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I mean, okay, the thing is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with the My Hero Academia fandom, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that.
(Garnt burps) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about My Hero Academia fandom.
- That's how I feel about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that, I think it's the case of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the same like 10 people who
have the shittiest takes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on Twitter, that are like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, it's not just My Hero Academia, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's any like popular Shonen that becomes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very mainstream.
- Very mainstream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This always happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like My Hero Academia happened, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [All] Demon Slayer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And now Uzaki is like,
it's always the talk of town. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's that like, how
many times during My Heroes' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like airing period was
there like tweets be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Look at it, it's disgusting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not even remotely
close to the manga." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they had the
manga right next to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, one fucking like leg- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, I love re-tweeting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like quote retweeting people like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like I think there was one of,
I think it was a screenshot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from later episode of
season two or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And the caption, I'm guessing it's like a- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We both retweeted it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it was like a
14-year-old girl probably, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> captioned it being like, "I can't believe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they would do this to my boy." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It was something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I literally quoted it being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Am I blind or is there
literally no fucking difference?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No 'cause I remember seeing that tweet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I remember thinking,
"Wait, what's the problem?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Is there a problem? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Is this like pouty right now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you're upset that
this is colored in now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This happened so many times, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they would just have the
still of the animation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and a still the manga and there
was barely any difference. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yes, there's gonna be some detail missing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a the fucking manga page. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But in my opinion it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're that upset, just
read the fucking manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like why are you watching the anime? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I remember logging onto Twitter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever Demon Slayer was in its peak </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or when My Hero Academia was in it's peak. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd be like, "Surely
there can't be a shittier </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> take than yesterday appear on my tablet." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And sure enough, there was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like everyone was competing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They were having a tournament
arc of shitty takes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what it was like
when they were airing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in their peaks, man (chuckles). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I definitely do think
though, that the winner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of that tournament arc
was that fucking person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who was like, "Oh, Tundura's earrings." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing)
- Oh my God! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, it's very bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's got the Japanese Imperial flag on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And people were just like, "No." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not what it is.
- No, that's not what it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a hana.
- It's a hanafuda. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, "What are you talking about?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember, I don't usually
call people out on Twitter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I don't wanna give
those people attention. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But sometimes I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "I don't give a shit
if this gets attention, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is fucking hilarious."
- I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like you get so
many people who are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh dude, I found that out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I found the way to like call them out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and get the woke points on Twitter." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And they call it out everyone's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Dude, shut the fuck up, no one cares." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And sometimes they're like so, it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so hypocritical.
- So stretching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because okay, I remember
this one time I saw like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this tweet about like My
Hero Academia and the girls </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, you know, don't
sexualize the girls, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they're in high
school and whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you go on their profile, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're talking about
shipping Todoroki and his dad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like what, what is going on here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was one girl who was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there was like a poster
that Horikoshi had drawn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as like a thank you for
like season three end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was all of the UA
girls in like swimsuits. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and some girl had retweeted being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how dare Horikoshi sexualize
these 14-year-olds? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And literally the top reply
was someone who screenshoted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that person's likes list,
and it was just Todoroki. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Yaoi, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just straight up.
- Oh my god, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my god.
- Like Todoroki Yaoi, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> being like, "Dude, is this you?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who's this man?
- Yeah, who's this man? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, it's just (sighs) I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What was the other one,
there was like a My Hero, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> another, 'cause of course there is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they find anything to get mad at. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That wasn't the Maduta one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which one's the Maduta one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like one of the
scientists in season- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah.
- That was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was China though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was another one which
is like Bakugo's birthday </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the same birthday as Hitler's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Remember that one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't remember that one.
- You don't remember that one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I saw that on Twitter being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I logged onto Twitter one morning, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I saw My Hero Academia
tweet, you know, trending. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I was like, "Oh god what now?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I went onto it, and it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some person was like, okay
so the official birthdays </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of all of the UA students
came out, and I just found out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that Bakugo's birthday
is the same as Hitler's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Does that mean Horikoshi
supports war criminals? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "You can't
be serious, right?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The worst thing about
that doctor one is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like the Japanese, like war crime dude? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that I looked at it and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "That's my birthday."
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Does CDawgVA support war criminals? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, is my
birthday just canceled now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because somebody who was born </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on my birthday did a bad thing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was like, I'm
like, "What do I think?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like what is, this is dumb, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because the Bakugo
is Hitler's birthday tweet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was so funny because all
the replies were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "That's my birthday."
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just like yeah, there
was 365, maybe 366, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's obviously gonna overlap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just a fucking
day (laughs) of the year, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, it's not like, since
when was somebody like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, April 25th is Hitler's birthday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Another one, another
dumb thing was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think they were like, in the
anime, I think they made them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like slightly thinner
compared to the manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - People lost their their fucking shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were like I can't believe this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't believe they're fat
shaming with these characters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, it's literally two pixels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm just there with
my flaming hot Cheetos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just sitting there like,
"I don't fucking care." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't give a fuck mate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's, who gives a shit? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, half the time they
don't even do that consciously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't like get the whole redrawing art </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or fixing art trends or whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's happening on Twitter.
- Oh my god. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That shit pisses me the fuck off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is like the most toxic thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bro, I stay, dude,
artists arguing on Twitter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like the most like, they're just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> throwing the same grenade back and forth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I'm not touching it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like two cancer cells fighting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh Joey.
- Oh my god! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Going for the throat, Joey.
- What the? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I've tweeted about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really care.
- I am not affiliated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with Joey in any way,
artists, I like your work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like two cancer cells fighting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like either way
I'm dying from cancer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, I don't really care.
- You can never like porn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on Twitter ever again Joey.
- Yeah, how dare I. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> How dare I.
- No more porn for you Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All the artists are
gonna come after you now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's 'cause I remember
there was one girl who, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they did it with Persona 5 as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like how fucking
dare you do with Persona 5. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like there was this new character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in Persona 5 Royal that
came out, called Kasumi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she's supposed to be
like a professional gymnast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And if you don't know anything
about the Persona games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like the regular character design </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there's your like
persona character design. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so the character, had
a gym uniform, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the usual like female gym uniform. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was based around that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there was this person
who, got that and was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh how dare Atlas sexualize, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this like, I think she's like 16 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the game?"
- It was a gym outfit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And there was like, and
so like they colored in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like pretty much like
the leotard part out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To make it just look like
she was wearing a fucking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like skin tight suit. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It looked like shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they were like, "I fixed it Atlas, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is what the character
should look like." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then what pissed me
off even more is when, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a tweet like that gets popular. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they replied to
their own tweet being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "By the way guys, follow
me on Deviant Art. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm an artist, please hire me." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Look, artists
out there, don't do that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's not how you get hired. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- Who are you to say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what artwork is correct, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, to me that's like,
it's like if we made a video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and someone's like there I corrected it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I dubbed over it and made it funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, okay, so what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's 'cause what you're doing is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're basically just putting
like a giant middle finger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the original artists, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you don't know what the
fuck their intention was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They just made a piece
of artwork, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially when it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the cultural difference
between in Japan and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah but like I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the thing I had, the biggest gripe I had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the whole Persona thing and a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of these like, "I fixed your art things," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that like, there isn't
anything inherently wrong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the original art. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just your fucking prerogative
that you think it's bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like Twitter's a shit show, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which we all say.
- Yeah, yeah of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, this recent controversy
with the Uzaki-Chan design </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just the most stupid.
- Oh my god! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking thing I have seen.
- It's so dumb. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is it even an argument? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why is it even an argument? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just, I look at
that shit and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "How do you motherfuckers have the energy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, how do you wake
up every day and decide, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I'm gonna do today? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Argue on Twitter for two hours?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm gonna get angry about the design </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of this fictional character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who's ever changed their
mind 'cause of a fucking tweet? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, who in the history of humanity, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has seen a tweet and been like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You know my opinions,
they're fucking wrong." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You'd be surprised. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have changed my mind
and I've made a mistake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You were right all along, I've never- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had a relapse of judgment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - My god! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, going on to other fandoms. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, JoJo fans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So can we talk about JoJo fans? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> The locusts of the animate community. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because that's what they are.
- Is that what we're gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> call them?
- Locusts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The religious plague
of the animate community. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're the frogs
that most weighing down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm gonna head out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, I mean, we
can't, we can't shit talk, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean we can shit talk.
- No, we can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shit talk JoJo fans.
- No, you can shit-talk me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can shit talk me.
- But we can shit talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because we are in that fandom, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right?
- No, no, because we are in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that fanbase, we're JoJo fans.
- I feel like we're varying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> degrees of.
- We're varying degrees, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like there's like, it's
like a gradient right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And you've gotten better, recently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing)
- I went to rehab. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I went to rehab.
- But my god, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when Connor discovered JoJo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> he was the most annoying JoJo
fan you could ever imagine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, in the church of JoJo he went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> from like alter boy to the Pope, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like he just ascended.
(Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, everything has to be JoJo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, when did
you first properly get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> into JoJo, 'cause, was
it when you were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in peak JoJo toxicity.
- Yeah because, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm curious because, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> from my point of view.
- It's kind of happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> out of nowhere.
- It kind of happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of nowhere, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I've watched, when
I was moving house once, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I downloaded, 'cause only at the time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only Stardust Crusaders had finished. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Before part four started,
and I downloaded it all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, "Well, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this guy talks about it a lot on YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He says it's quirky."
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, and I fucking hated the art style. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought it looked like shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Why is it so fucking ugly?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is what I hear a lot from JoJo fans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I totally understand- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, wait you downloaded
'cause I mentioned it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've created a monster. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my god!
- He did this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my god!
- You're like the scientist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that created Frankenstein, you're like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like maybe you had a part to play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in the catalyst of like,
you didn't start it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but maybe you definitely
accelerated it a bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I downloaded it and I was moving house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I had no internet for about a week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it didn't even take me
a week, like three days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I watched and, oh my fucking god dude, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Stardust Crusaders part one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> The first watch, fucking boring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That shit was so long, why
was there an Orangutan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There was a boat, what is that Araki? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean now, now I love it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, now it's hilarious, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now I think it's amazing,
but at the time I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I hate this, I hate this so much." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Part two had a good thing going, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why are you ruining it Araki? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Part one, okay here's what it is, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I sympathize a lot
with JoJo fans who come, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not JoJo fans, people who wanna
get into JoJo who are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "I just can't get into it, it's hard." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yes, it is hard to get into. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is just such a weird
thing and it's so different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from what you're used to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's grated.
- Dare I say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's an acquired taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think some parts, it is,
and there's a lot of people now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who really want to like
it just to get the memes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be in the know, and it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "You don't have to. I don't
care if you do or don't." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is, the biggest
thing about JoJo fans, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna say, is that please stop trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to get absolutely everyone into JoJo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Not everyone should get into JoJo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's not something
that appeals to everyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it is a commitment,
as much as I like, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I have to basically say to people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "If you make it past Starters Crusaders, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're probably in for the long run." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, that is nearly
what, like 70 episodes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 70 episodes?
- Yeah, something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's 48 plus, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's about 71 episodes.
- It's like 20 volumes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the manga.
- So, asking someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like, "Hey, it
gets good 72 episodes in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the point of no return,"
it's like, that's a hard sell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Anyway so, I'll get back to that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I watched it and
then I kind of was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't think anything of it, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I watched part
four, and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is really good." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Part five hadn't come
out, I was adamant on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I actually tried to read the manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I couldn't, I couldn't
do it, I was like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause at this point I
didn't start reading manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was strictly not reading manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, "No, I can't do it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I've read the first
chapter of part five, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, "No, no." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What is this, who's this
fucking Giorno cunt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So then I started watching
part five as it aired, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I got about three
episodes in and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I really want to know what happens." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I started reading
ahead and then it became like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I read part five in
like, like a day I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Jesus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I read part
six the next day. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I read part seven
over like two, three days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And part seven was like by far my, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and part seven is when I think
it solidified my obsession </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with it, 'cause part seven
was so fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And if you have finished all the anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're one of the anime-only peeps, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like I was for a long time,
please give it a shot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The manga is so, so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, part six and
seven's manga is so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, then I became like
obsessed and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay well, I wanna go back
and read all the manga now," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I feel that it was kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of a really different experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I got to go through it a lot faster. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And a lot of the pacing
issues I felt in the anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> at least at part three, could
be resolved with the manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I went back and I re-watched it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just became fully obsessed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think whilst I
was reading part seven, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was meeting up with you a bunch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I slowly became more annoying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because like, the thing I
hate about JoJo fans is that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they assume that nobody watches
JoJo, like in the old days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you know what I mean?
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They are the most vocal fan base out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of fucking any other anime fan base. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's always the same fucking- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We wanna talk about a
dick measuring contest, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like JoJo fans, it's a
dick-measuring contest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I actually feel sorry for any musician </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who Araki chooses to
like name as the star. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh dude, you go to their
comment section on YouTube- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's like the JoJo
fans have taken over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my god!
- Which is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like, I called
them locusts right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause they like invade,
they take all the crops, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they take everything and then
they move on to the next one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like the Independence
Day aliens right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where they just like, make this
fucking world uninhabitable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then they move on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the next world.
- Move on to the next one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you see when the Star
Wars released their new like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> R2D2 thing, and it was called Dio? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing)
- Oh my god. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - All the comments were "Kono Dio, Da." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like all of them.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so, when Connor was
in like peak JoJo fandom, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this kind of came out of nowhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause he would just start
making JoJo references, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like in everyday life, and
like, I remember in England, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we still hung out like pretty often. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah like once or twice
a, every, one a week, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> every two weeks, whatever.
- Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And just every time I
would hang out with Connor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he would just keep making JoJo references. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was like, I thought JoJo
fans were annoying online. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hanging out with a JoJo fan in real life, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as a fan of JoJo, made
me start to hate JoJo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I didn't know that
was physically possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until I started to hang out with Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like we would be like eating a meal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in some Italian restaurant,
and Connor would just be going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through this fucking menu, being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, Prosciutto, that's a JoJo character." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh look, you ordered the black pasta. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> This is like that scene
from part two where." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jesus Christ, that's a JoJo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and I would just be
sitting there being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Motherfucker, I'm just trying
to eat my fucking pasta. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Can you not right now?" (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember I would just do
it on purpose at some point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> then be like, "Oh you approached me." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause when we were like
drunk, I know, I know- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember that one party we went to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we got fucking wasted,
and every time someone walks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> towards you, you would be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, you're approaching me,
you're approaching me, oh." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm so glad I wasn't in the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that one-
- It was funny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like the first two times but
like the 50th time that night- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The worst part was everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> at the party started doing it though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I had done it so much
that everyone was saying it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my god.
- But like they didn't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what even, they were even
referencing most of the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They were just copying, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my god.
- Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> needless to say that I get
it, because the passion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for it when you first get into, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like really into it, is so intense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And like you love everything about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because everything
about that is so quotable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like you can take anything out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of context and it's quotable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that it's like, the
way I try and describe it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like the selling point is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's such a unique
experience in anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- It is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And in a manga that you
just, nothing comes close. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know everyone says
that, but it really is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think also because,
being especially, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the reason it's done
so well in the West is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like it's kind of
almost accessible, 'cause a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the western references
make it really easy to digest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's because Araki, as
well, has said that he's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> his biggest influence was western comics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And it's so cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it feels like it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, anime is kind of
like acknowledging us, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> our kind of like thing, right?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, I fucking
love Earth, Wind & Fire, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and when I first saw like the
Stand Earth Wind and Fire, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like I fucking love that band. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, when you see a band that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you listen to, it's so hype, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then when you see
it again in part seven </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like hold on a sec.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, wait, did Aki do a mistake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But no, it's like, I think
it's so easily digestible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in some ways and it's such
a, no author does anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this in any other way.
- No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the absurdity of it, but also, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so dumb yet clever at the same time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's really just an overall experience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and such a good style like, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well that's why it's one of
the most parodied Shonen Jump </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> titles ever by other Shonen Jump artists. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm reading Eyeshield 21 at the moment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they fucking, when
they throw the ball, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of them shout "Aura." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's like, just gonna casually- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like literally every Shonen Jump artist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has probably parodied or
referenced JoJo in some way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's like so unique,
so that's why it's infinitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like fucking quotable
and people can reference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this all day long and people
do reference this all day long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] A little too much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is what gets
annoying at some point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because, I remember when
JoJo first started airing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like parts one and
two, I remember talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about it.
- No one gave a shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember talking about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, I think it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my very first year review,
when it was like 2013. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like talking
about JoJo being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, there's this like
long forgotten anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's being, long forgotten manga, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's being adapted called JoJo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You guys should probably watch it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not knowing how big it would become, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking seven years
later, 'cause now everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the anime community knows JoJo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I don't think everyone
in the anime community </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> should get into JoJo,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's hard, like as much as I love it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there's so many pitfalls
that would put someone off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the first few parts
where he's really coming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> into his own as an author, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think part four is really
where he starts to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, from part four onwards, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're getting a fucking
amazing experience." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, I agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But there's so many growing
pains in between that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And yeah, it's a- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Part one and three mostly,
I feel are the growing pains. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I think that's also
one of the annoying parts, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is that people who love part
two then go to part three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they get something
totally, kind of different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's hard to be like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's hard to adjust, yeah.
- Just kind of put up with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I wonder, like if
I had internet, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had any form of internet,
would I have dropped it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I wonder about that, would I? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I, the only reason I watched it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is I had no other anime
downloaded, except for this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember being like,
"Fucking come on, man." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Ah, gee, this fucking fight's so boring." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, "Come on." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I don't know, it
just feels like nowadays, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people will still make JoJo references, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and the JoJo fandom still acts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's this really
underground kind of show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that everyone should get into, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just not that case anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] No, no.
(Connor inhales) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we are an annoying fandom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think they understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they might be pushing
a lot of people away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from the show, and now, just
because of how vocal they are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like to, now, at least publicly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with my JoJo references,
I like to be sparing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and like save it for a good moment, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause a good JoJo
reference at the right time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hits differently.
- Right, that's the thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it does hit differently, but
like that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is like, I think, as well, that a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of people are just getting
fucking sick of JoJo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is because it is so
quotable in any situation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, so many of the
JoJo memes now are just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Dude, come on, like."
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, "Dude, come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Come on, you can do better than that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like there are a lot of good memes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There are a lot of good memes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't get me wrong.
- I think it's like that now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because there's no new anime airing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but whenever there's a new anime airing- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh dude, when part six,
like becomes an anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever that may be, the memes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> are gonna be fucking top tier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, we already know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But in the meantime, this
is just the dead moment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of just dead memes,
where it's just kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> putting the JoJo fanbase in
a little bit of a bad light, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel, because they're just shitting out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these memes everywhere
and people are just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Alright, I get it."
- They do go a bit ham. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like, for you as a JoJo fan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> do you ever feel defensive
whenever someone shits </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on JoJo, or like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, it depends what for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, if they're shitting
on it, like just to shit it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which many people are, because you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fandom's super
fucking annoying, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I mean.
- And it's a popular show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I get annoyed by it, right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I read this and I'm
like, "Dude, you're 12. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't talk on the internet." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who gave you permission? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your profile picture is
Meliodas, please stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I mean, (sighs) it's hard, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's like watching
your little brother, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like shit his pants in public, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, come on, man, like come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're making me look bad, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause there's so many
like cool things in JoJo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, okay, the JoJo like fashion is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the coolest fucking shit.
- Dude it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is fucking next level.
- It's, by far, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the best animate fashion, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think anything comes close </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to it.
- I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's how they did a
collab with like, fucking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Gucci.
- Oh, Gucci. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, yeah.
- I am so fucking sad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that I don't own anything
from the Gucci collection. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You know if they do another JoJo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Gucci collection.
- Was it Gucci </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or Louis Vuitton? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They did both.
- It was Gucci. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They did Louis Vuitton as well? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think they did Louis
Vuitton as well, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm pretty sure.
- No, they did BVLGARI. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, BVLGARI.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They did the figures
with the gems in them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- We know fashion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Gucci, 'cause they did a, I
think, Araki wrote a short, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it was a 12-page or a 13-page- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, with Kishibe Rohan, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, Kishibe Rohan Gucci promotion, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's fucking amazing
and I wished that I had, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like no anime comes close to
like pure like fashion style </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> as JoJo.
- No, it really doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Araki did a fucking JoJo
exhibition at the Louvre. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's like no other
anime artist can do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not even close,
and the reason why is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause anime is such a, I
feel like it's been like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watered down style, right, almost. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the style is so same at this point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you have something like JoJo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that yes, is very grating
to look at in the start, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but the more you come into it
and the more you get into it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like, "Holy shit, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is really fucking cool." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, 'cause I feel like after about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's part four or
part five, where Araki- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Gets gay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Gets gay, he just gets gay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like let's just be honest.
- Part five is hella gay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, part five is hella gay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I love it.
- There's so much shekchu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> There's so much gay tension.
- It's so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - In part five, it's like perfect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never seen that
many open chests in my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as in part five.
- And you can see. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And you can see how much of like a- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fashion is rubbed off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How much fashion has like rubbed off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> onto his like character designs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and just like the entire aesthetic of- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Most of the poses from like part four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or five onwards are all like, just Vogue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, just Vogue.
- Vogue covers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or like fashion shots that are taken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're just like,
amazing in anime form. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, it's so obvious that
he had like an appreciation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for fashion that I don't
think many authors had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure there's someone
in the comments who's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Um, actually," but, you know,
in just super mainstream, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we just haven't seen that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- It's someone who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously loves fashion, but
has been able to integrate it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in such a unique way.
- So well, so well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause you know, there's a
difference between having like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how to put this into words, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like having characters
wear good fashion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like one of the things I
love about Rent-A-Girlfriend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually, is how like
their outfits change. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, it was one of the
few like anime you see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where every episode,
the character is wearing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a different outfit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can tell like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the authors.
- The authors cared, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Put thought into this, but like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what I feel about JoJo fashion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is just that it embodies fashion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not just the clothes
but just like the whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> aesthetic.
- The whole feel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The whole feel, and
everything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It feels like runway
models with personality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like dare I say- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And superpowers.
- Oh my god, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that is like, so JoJo.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like from part five onwards,
it does feel like everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is a runway model.
- It's runway models </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with superpowers, that's what it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's genuinely like
what it feels like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it, and like, I never
gave a fuck about fashion, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but ever since like getting into JoJo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, when I saw like high fashion stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like expensive shit, I'm
like, "It kinda like looks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty fucking gorgeous."
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's true though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I literally never, I
always used to think like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "$10 for a T-shirt is the max level." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No more, and then the more I got, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I started looking at JoJo, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Why is that guy hot? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like he looks fucking dumb,
but like, it's hot though." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, like.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I was like, dude
his outfit is fucking cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does that drip clean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that drip clean man, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, okay, maybe I can start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to appreciate fashion a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's when I last.
- Oh yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I definitely came to the
same, because I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, there's this
brand in Japan called Glamb, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which does a massive.
- If you're wondering </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where we get most of, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> anime T-shirts now.
- Anime T-shirts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's probably from Glamb. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, all of the JoJo shirts
that you've seen is probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> from Glamb.
- Yeah, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I scoffed the first time I saw </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when the T-shirt was like $80. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That is a lot, and that
pained me to pay that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but after a while I'm like,
this shit looks so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I would rather have one of this T-shirt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than eight shitty T-shirts.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just 'cause like,
there's only a few places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I can rep like my favorite anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and not have to worry about- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Being a fucking embarrassment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Being that cringy weeb, right, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause like there's
some anime fashion which, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's no other way I can put
it, but just it's just tacky. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so, put a fucking giant logo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- It's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the kind of shirts you only
wear to anime conventions, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's it, you know?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or as pajamas, that's
the only time, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly, but some of like
the JoJo fashion I've seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just looks fucking fantastic.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you can like, you
can be a weeb just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in public, you know, and still- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that Diavolo jacket I have, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that King Crimson jacket I have is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so fucking sexy.
- Yeah, exactly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so cool.
- I love wearing that jacket. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Goddamn.
- It's so fucking cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Basically there is a
lot to love about JoJo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the last dick
suck I will do of JoJo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yes, the fandom is
probably one of the worst, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if not the worst right now, publicly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's pretty fucking awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, it's pretty bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wish you guys would chill
the fuck out a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I feel like, the only time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I've had a knee jerk
reaction about someone saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're speaking about JoJo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had that, I had the exact same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I had the exact same thing.
- Like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I became everything I hated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And me and Connor have
already talked about this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's Cr1TiKaL, it's
when Cr1TiKaL did a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what did he do a video on again? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He was talking about,
it was Dunkey's video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about how.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - About how Final Fantasy
fans are the worst </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, they're like so
aggressive about their opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so it's a Cr1TiKaL video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's called "Dunkey Has Gone Too Far," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that's what it was.
- Something like, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And so Charlie talks
about how, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> these rabid Final Fantasy fans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have taken Dunkey's
opinion way too seriously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Right?
- Yeah, kind of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then he goes in
this, he uses this analogy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And of course, of course
he uses JoJo fans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I was, when he
brought up JoJo, I was ready </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like (claps hands)
you're right, king. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Totally right.
- Like you are totally right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I totally get this.
- Part one sucks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> part three sucks, we get it, cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then he goes on
to say that, I think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> he prefers part one and
two to part three and four, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just had this (table thumps). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Chotomate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never hit the space
bar with such aggression, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like (table thumps) "What?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "What?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I've heard most
opinions about JoJo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've heard shitty takes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but that was the shittiest take. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Charlie, what was that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Charlie, part four is amazing!
- Charlie! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I just want to, no, no.
- What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just want to understand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> No, no.
- Come on the podcast Charlie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> explain yourself.
- But look, look, look. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to be that
JoJo fan right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'm going to fully
morph into that JoJo fan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause like, I've heard, you
know, if you don't like JoJo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's fine, I've heard
that take so many times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where I'm just like, JoJo's not for you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's good, that's fine, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But I've never heard the take where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone.
- I've never heard that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never heard that.
- Someone prefers parts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one and two over parts three and four. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe like, maybe part
two over part three, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but part one, part one.
- Over part four. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Over three and four? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Four? Four is amazing! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It is so good.
- I don't like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the personified powers,
I'd rather see the powers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I can't fucking see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Charlie, Charlie, this, this, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I just wanna understand, I want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to understand, please.
- Please, please, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I need to know.
- There's a spot right here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Charlie, for you, so explain yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is not hate, I just want to know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to know.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause me and Connor are
both like space bar this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> go to the comments section and
nobody was talking about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Nobody's was talking about it.
- Yeah no one was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was so furious.
- Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, why is
nobody talking about this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> This is the biggest issue in 2020. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why is nobody?
- Probably because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're all off on like ask slash JoJo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being like, "Did you this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you see this bullshit?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never had a reaction
like that in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've normally been like, yeah,
king, whatever you want, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, and I was like,
"No, no, that is wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That is wrong, what is that?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's just wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it's literally the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've heard this opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have never heard that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought I was prepared for anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, Charlie, come
on and defend yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I, we need to, we need to talk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we do need to talk- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Come to Japan when.
- Come to Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - When America stops imploding, after. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Come to Japan, not only
because we want you as a guest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> on the show, but mostly
because we wanna hear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> your opinions on JoJo, your
garbage, garbage opinions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Just kidding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Moving on from JoJo, which
is probably the worst fandom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now, we all agree, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> JoJo's the worst fandom right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean.
- Dragon Ball </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is a close second.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whenever, like whenever
a JoJo anime is airing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like, the anime community </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is just like a minefield. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah.
- Oh, yeah, it's great, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I love it, I love it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> As a guy who can navigate
the minefield comfortably- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As someone who is going into the field, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> planting new mines.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Laying the mine to myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think another kind of fandom
that we haven't touched on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we've only touched on Shonen fandoms, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is arguably the horniest fandom,
which is the Yaoi fandom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - See, I don't really see it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - All that much, I mean, I know you do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You would be more of
the expert than I am. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Yaoi fandom is imagine if, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> instead of being passionate
about Dragon Ball, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're passionate about dudes fucking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, that's, that level of passion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, good on them I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I read a manga recently
and it's, it was one where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the whole kink was that
he had inverted nipples </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that was the selling point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw that on Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like, and it's just crazy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause people'll get so into this stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I love reading it 'cause it's so funny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and absurd but some people love this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And they get so aggressive about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then, it's equally on the other side, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like, "Don't fetishize
this shit, it's not healthy." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's always like a war going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What, about inverted nipples? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - About like gay relationships
and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's 'cause it's like women, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- But I mean (laughs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fucking Kathy, it's stupid either way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly.
- Who takes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this shit seriously? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> No one cares, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The fucking inverted
nipples shit killed me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, there's tons of it.
- Because like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it killed me because I
knew it wasn't a parody. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, no, no, no.
- I was like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I know this is real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The whole plot of that Yaoi as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was a really fun, stupid one as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll explained it to you, so it's great, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause even conceptually, explaining it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to you is so absurd.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And Meilyne knows it, Meilyne's read it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Meilyne] I have not, why would you- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - She has. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Meilyne] Why would you assume that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, this guy needs to
get a new house, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he finds this
amazing share house that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it looks amazing, it's so cheap. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the reason why
he gets it for so cheap </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that the owner of the
house only lets like hunks in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like absolute eye candy as he prefaces it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this Yaoi starts off,
right, by one of the other hunks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who lives in the house (laughs). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Is like, come on, let's
take a bath together. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause they have like
an onset or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in this house.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he sees his inverted
nipples and he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Dude, that's hot as shit!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Like that's my kink." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's like, "You know, if
you get you turned on enough, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll invert back to normal." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What?
- And so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> immediately starts doing shit to him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it turns out that
he had hired a prostitute </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that wasn't the prostitute, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just the new
housemate or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, this is insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The plots that they come up with in Yaoi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are just insane.
- Oh my god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And okay, I get it, a
lot of people are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh god, sounds gay, I'm not into that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It like, no, please read
it, it's so fucking funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no, I wanna read it.
- I wanna read it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just the stories alone are so absurd, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like the leaps that they take, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they get, yeah.
- That's why I wanna get more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> into Yaoi, because like, out
of the few that I've read, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, this is too funny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not to go further in.
- If you genuinely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wanna read like a decent
Yaoi with like a great story, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think 10 Dance is pretty good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's about ballroom dancing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I've heard that on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hella gay, but so fucking good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Actually like an amazing
story, kinda ironically, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love how we went
from Dragon Ball fanbase </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to here are some Yaoi I recommend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I genuinely
think that Yaoi fans, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you don't really see them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you guys probably don't like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They are like the Dragon Ball
fans, but like for gay porn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Kinda, kinda, like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do they have like
power levels on dick size </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything like that?
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sadly no, and they don't care
who can suck dick the best. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're not like, "Yo,
Saitama can out-suck Goku </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> any day of the week." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, Goku can handle at
least a 10-inch girth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any day of the week." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Goku has a 10-inch girth." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, "Goku can still
suck dick even with HIV." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, it's like, it's just
like this kind of, almost, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you'll say, "Oh, I like a Yaoi." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But if you say you like a Yaoi, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you better be prepared for people like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Read this one, oh my god,
you have to read this one." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "This one's great!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know how many fucking Yaois </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I got recommended after you and I did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that Yaoi a sama video? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because, Yaoi
fans will not be content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> until you've read their favorite Yaoi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I mean, there's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like a lot of
fandoms like that as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - True, true, true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, the Fate fandom
I think is definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of that, where they
hear that you're into like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> one Fate and then they're, okay- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How dare you haven't seen every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Type-Moon franchise.
- I am that Fate fan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well Fate fans are the,
if Dragon Ball's the ghetto, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fate are the crack dealers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the way I see it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like, they're the
ones who are profiting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> off.
- Yeah, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so you want more, huh? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, I got more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We got more, what do you want? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You want the Waifu, do you want the story? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We got it all.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> their gateway drug is heroin,
and then it only gets worse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from there, like it's, like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> we need a full like, ecosystem
to know who is the failure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in society.
- It's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, you finished all the Fate, huh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Have you heard of Sukihima?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I know you wanna get into that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, you like Saber? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like the different
kinds of marijuana strains. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Saber, it's like, oh, you like
Saber of the dank, do you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Saber of the dank.
- We finally have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> every kind of Saber now,
'cause cast of Saber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just got recently
released in the JP servers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and now we can, we can go full Saber. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All the Sabers, give me more Sabers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't need any
more Sabers, Type-Moon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Stop it, stop it.
- It's free real-estate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Type-Moon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thank god.
- No, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> another toxic fandom I can think of that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> have just covered.
- Just checking off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are we gonna piss off now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, no, okay, let's just piss off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone now.
- We're gonna piss off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everybody.
- Who haven't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we pissed off yet? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do we have any more beers? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do we have any?
- Web Toon readers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Web Toon readers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, so because, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do we even count them? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They're, come on.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that even a fanbase? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, because like, I didn't
realize how passionate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were until Tower
of God started airing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I remember making
a Tower of God video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like, when I tweeted it out or anytime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would tweet anything
out about Tower of God, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was the most toxic like Twitter chain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could ever thing of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, where people
like, Tower of God fans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are that dedicated fandom,
and from what I've seen, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of the Web Toon
fan base are the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I've seen like equally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with like the God of High
School fandom as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where they will defend the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as like, the greatest piece of literature </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's ever been made.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Right, and I'm like, yeah,
I like Tower of Gods. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, God of High School,
I haven't read the Web Toon, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that could be better, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the anime is
pretty mediocre as it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, they will like go to war </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like make sure everyone
knows how good this Web Toon is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm really scared now
because I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> next season we're getting
the Noblesse anime, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which basically completes the
trifecta of like the Web Toon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you know when you
have like a slight problem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like, or like a slight criticism </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with like this certain
anime or show or manga </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you make like a tweet about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then the billion
fucking tweets you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like, "Um, excuse me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, this criticism is wrong.
- How dare you, oh my god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that's like what I've
seen with like Web Toon's fans, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like times a hundred.
- Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, or at least
like with Tower of God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause like, that was my
experience with Tower of God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I was like, "I like Tower of God," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then I've read like
the comments chains, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and a lot of it just really put me off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the Tower of God fandom, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean?
- Jeez, I never got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that at all, in my head, I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Damn, this has got a
fucking good soundtrack." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's all I heard, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, it's Kevin, hey!"
- Kevin, Kevin, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you did good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You did good, Kevin, you did good Kevin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck the Oxygen fandom,
you know, fuck those guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who needs Oxygen man,
they have real stuck-up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no, who haven't we pissed off yet then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Wait, is there a good fandom? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> No.
- No (laughs). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause the more I go
through it, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Love Life, garbage, Band Dream, garbage." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Every single fan.
- Fairy Tail. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fairy Tail, oh my god,
Fairy Tail is awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my god.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fairy Tail is, man, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the people who like
Fairy Tail are the ones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who kept those mats, you
know, the kids with the town? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- You know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're the people who kept those. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That still use them.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They have little cars
go around, no (laughs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember one time there
was this fucking like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it was supposed
to be a smear campaign </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> against me, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, 'cause you said that
Fairy Tail was garbage? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I said that
Fairy Tail was garbage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in one of my Let's Fight videos, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there was a moment on Instagram </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where people were like tweeting out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like posting this like picture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like Natsu and Lucy, and it was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Protect Fairy Tail from the anime man." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there was like 30 people
on Instagram being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yes, let's protect our
favorite show because some dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the internet said
it was a garbage show." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, "Oh my, all I said was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that this show sucks," like, just chill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like chill out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it a natural occurrence that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at a certain age, you
just stop giving a fuck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if someone hates on what you like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or is it a thing that some people have? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just.
- 'Cause I don't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I genuinely don't know anyone our age </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who gets that angry about, do you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- 'Cause I don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't, I mean like, I like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to have like arguments, not arguments, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or like debates.
- I love chatting shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love talking outta my
ass and getting angry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> at Joey about the Baccano! dub, but like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not like actually- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I'm not gonna be offended by it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, I mean
'cause we're friends right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I'm not gonna, on
Twitter, get actually angry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at someone 'cause, I
mean, a lot of the context </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the humor is lost if I do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
- Yeah, I mean like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on Twitter especially, which
I feel like we're putting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most of this, like most of our opinions- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, this is normally
coming from Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Rarely anything else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd say, 90% of what I
see has come from Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It is just not like,
not the right platform </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for this kind of like debate.
- No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And argument, like I
said, who's ever changed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their opinion 'cause of a fucking tweet? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't have enough characters
to make a poignant argument </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that can really.
- No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm not gonna sit
through a fucking like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> seven tweet thread, right?
- The first thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you think when you get like what, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a fucking 20-page paragraph? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Your immediate is not to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna consider what they've said. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, how do
immediately counter this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is your first thought on Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It always is, it's everyone's first thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's like, what's the fucking point? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you just, you know, go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and fucking watch
Meliodas touch up a girl, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who fucking cares, go do what you want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you enjoy it, then
cool, but just be aware </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that there are people out
there who don't think that way, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right, who don't agree with the fact that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not a personality
trait to touch women. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Just saying, I'm gonna say it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna say it, I
just think it's stupid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why does Meliodas need to do it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, I still wonder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I wake up in a cold sweat at night, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, why does- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you wake up like Meliodas did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in the fucking thing?
- Yeah, I'm like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I think- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why is Meliodas assaulting women? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Now I'm not a simp, right I. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just think it's 'cause of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when did they originally come out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it was like mid-2000s, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was it okay in mid-2000? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, 'cause remember
this time in mid-2000s </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where entire character quirks was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, let's trip over and
touch an anime girl? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it was like.
- Literally every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> harem protagonist?
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> literally every harem protagonist,
that was like the quirk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a difference between tripping up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> though and being like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - True, true, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like, as an adult male,
an adult monkey-brained male, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched that, and I
sat there and I thought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Who is this appealing
to, this character trait?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I'm wondering who. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Chris, do you know 'cause
I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's gotta be 12-year-olds, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's gotta be 12 year olds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's how like most
of my arguments are done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, who likes this,
12-year-old, must be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Probably isn't, but to my head, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no adult who's functioning in society. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe I just answered my own question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, there you go.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not appealing to those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who function in society.
- If you are over the age </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of 18, do you like that
Meliodas touches people? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If so, can you tell me why,
'cause I'm genuinely curious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, what about it is fun? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like I can understand
if you don't have a problem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with it, but like, if you actively like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Enjoy it, like that's a good, like yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what I mean.
- Yeah, I'm genuinely curious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're like hell yeah,
Meliodas, you feel up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that bitch.
- 'Cause like I said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't give a shit, it's just kinda </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like smelling a bad fart,
like I'm like, fuck it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (groans) disgusting, carry
on, but like I don't care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like its not gonna stop
me from watching it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I just think it's dumb. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know.
- I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like, bad animation is more likely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to stop you from watching it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's way worse.
- Yeah, that's way worse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That's a way worse,
that's a way better reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to stop fucking watching it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - God, what did they do to you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sorry Seven Deadly Sins
fans, they did you dirty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think, what this episode
has given the realization of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that, if you put the blank fandom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And you put any anime in that blank, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's probably gonna be a shit fandom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, I mean, I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - As long as a fandom exists,
it's probably gonna suck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in some way.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think of any fandom and you'll find </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> annoying ass fucking memes
or dumb shit they say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, if you are a fan of
any anime in general, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> don't take what we said personally, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we just like to talk shit out of our ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We hate all fandoms equally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - None of this is serious,
if you're a Dragon Ball fan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> please don't think that
you can't talk to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You can't, actually, no, no.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can, as long as it's
not about Dragon Ball. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Only if you're here
to discuss the benefits </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of having Goku be HIV positive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - JoJo fans, please
just chill the fuck out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Not everyone needs to watch JoJo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We love JoJo, not everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> will love JoJo.
- What we've said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is not serious at all,
it's just us talking shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for two hours, just having a fun time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly, exactly.
- And hopefully, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> none of you took what
we said seriously today, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> although, if you are offended by this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> odds are you didn't make it this far </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> before you typed your comment.
- Actually, let's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> make this fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> What other fandoms piss you off? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's make it.
- Like on the comments. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's make the comment section </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> an entire fucking minefield. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If it's for us, if it's
Dragon Ball, what is it for you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What fandom is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Tell me, let us know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let us know.
- Come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is gonna go well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (men chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Hey, but in the meantime,
check out all these patrons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are helping us to support
the show and making us- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it the Trash Taste fandom? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If so.

<SPEAKER_02> - Oh god.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, we are going to- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The amount of smear campaigns </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are gonna happen on
Trash Taste being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "How fucking dare they."
- Let's cancel Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're gonna get canceled
from every fucking side </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the anime fandom.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you piss off everyone,
it's a negative-negative </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> situation, right, where.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone's like, "Well,
he pissed everyone off, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so it must be okay."
- Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But if the comments section
aren't enough for you guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you can also let
your opinions be shined </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> over on our Twitter and subreddit as well. </SPEAKER_00>

fanbase memes over there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, yeah guys, please don't
get offended with anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we said, there's, none of this is serious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We just, as you can see,
we're drinking, all right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So, immediately, it negates
all fucking credibility </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of what we're saying.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just noticed we've been
moving around so much more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when we're like, the more we've drunk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're all just like, (yells). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Fucking- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck anime, I hate anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Why do you watch anime? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fucking shit.
- Disgusting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (imitates spitting)
- Anime is mid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't hit different, it was a lie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> God lied.
(men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Good-bye Trash Taste viewers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, if we're not
canceled by the next episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then we'll see you next week all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Bye-bye
- Bye! </SPEAKER_02>
