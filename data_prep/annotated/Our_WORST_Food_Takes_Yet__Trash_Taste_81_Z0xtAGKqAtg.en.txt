<SPEAKER_01> and i'm like oh no they didn't why is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> this like a rare event isn't that </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> past two years now at least yeah every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> time like we have a rubik's cube in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> office now the old joey just goes ahead </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and solves it so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's been able to do it for a while yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know i do not remember you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> saying that as a new year's resolution i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> don't think i gave a new year's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> resolution because i haven't really been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> a guided like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> choose new year's resolutions because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> for the past like three or four years i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just haven't been able to do that yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it must be like i feel bad for the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> viewers who probably think that we have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like dementia or something that we can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember anything what we've said and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then we're like and we've probably had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this conversation last year we were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yes so uh we just don't like them so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we just decided i know i remember i must </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> have said something along the lines of i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just prefer like small goals that i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah bro i don't even remember what i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say like a week ago like sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes i have a conversation with my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mum and she was just like oh yeah when </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> hundred plus hours of us talking on this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> show but you just like remember this one </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> dire strike it's in the dire straits and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of course he uploads to a second channel </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> yeah even my mom my mum sends me a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> message and she's like i just saw that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> joey's channel is in trouble have you </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> have contacted youtube and i'm pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> confident it's going to get resolved so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why i'm not like too stressed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about it but uh it was it was very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> humbling when i made that video and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> so many people came to me and was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah i'll subscribe and all that so </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> really like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know if i like a situation that i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know is going to be resolved but i can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> still make a video complaining you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's you know it it just you get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you because you can monetize it yeah you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can market </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> wish i wish it like to my chat my main </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> channel literally on life support wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the reason why i was getting all these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> subs but you know like i mean your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> second channel has basically been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> becoming your anime channel for the long </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> there are people who don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> god comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so i paid for this license and whatnot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and uh i i angrily emailed the guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bear in mind i was like 19 so i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to conduct myself as a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> businessman but i didn't know what the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] i was doing yeah so i angrily </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> emailed him from my my hotmail account </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i instructed him that i'd purchased </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this license please tell this person to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stop and so this whole thing where the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guy wrote me an email being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> uh hey you have my word that you bought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the license and i had like paypal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> receipts so then i had to email this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> company that was claiming on behalf </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which i think was distrokid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so he had put this song in a copyright </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> claiming thing all right so it went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around so i had a bit of difficulty it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> took a while but i eventually got distro </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kid to like stop claiming my stuff right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right they stopped claiming it all and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was good i remember how i did it it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like this long whole process was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> awful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then all good all good i kept using </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the outro </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after that this is where i should have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> learned my lesson and changed the actual </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i thought i'd won the battle i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> done it i've done it also the song is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> banger so the song kind of slaps right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i i'd thought okay i'd proven </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to some entity that this is legit and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have the artist who you know says that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's all good and i thought okay this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this is it i'm good to use this now like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i paid for it i i got like proof and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're all gucci yeah and so i carry on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> using it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then maybe a year later i want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say i don't know how long exactly there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is a there was a timeline i get claimed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> again this time like two-thirds of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> channel i want to say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this is right before they added the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> option to mute </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like now if so you get copyright claimed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because sometimes there are still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] claims they'll claim like one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> second and then they'll say we hope </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> we're on the entire video so just just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mute it for one second yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you can mute it or delete the segment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> which is one of the more positive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> changes youtube has made you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> definitely and unfortunately this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> situation happened i want to say like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one month before they introduced that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tool yeah so i got all of my thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> claimed and i was kind of like what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] do i do because two-thirds of my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> revenue just like got fanossed away yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this this was this happened to my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> channel for about i want to say two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> months straight all right so for two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> months straight my earnings were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i lost so much money that i never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got back so it's very very i've still to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this day quite annoyed about that um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i i went on this whole thing of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right what the [ __ ] is going on so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like warner brothers or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had claimed it on behalf of uh some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> artists that i'd never heard of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i go and i find out that this was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remix and i'm like oh [ __ ] i didn't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and apparently this is like a big artist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i'm an idiot cause i didn't know who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this person was but i never thought i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> was a banger yeah right that's why i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a banger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so i was like okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so this is weird so i i thought that he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he sold me this license and it and it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was good so i i i very confidently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> counter every single claim thinking i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got the license it's all good and they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get denied and then i appeal them as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well which is like if you lose all these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> appeals your channel gets deleted yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i appealed a bunch of them and for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some reason i just got denied the appeal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but nothing happened right so i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't appeal again it was weird and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so now now i was starting to be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the [ __ ] like what's going on like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i counted all these claims and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and nothing happened and i don't really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know what to do now so i remember i got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in touch with the guy who i bought the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> license from who is the artist who made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this song i was like hey what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's going on man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you sold me a license is it good or is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it not and he's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i have the license to make the remix but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't think and then he was like i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not sure what i can and can't and i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wow i'm like what what and then i asked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i asked a youtube man who is a lawyer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man who gave me advice that was not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> legal advice every single sentence ended </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with this is not legal advice yeah he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically informed me that yeah this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> license was like no good yeah it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whether the whether the artist knew that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> or not i don't know he might genuinely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> not have known mm-hmm um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so basically if he's like an indie like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> artist as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah i assume that he didn't fully </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just doing some stroke i don't think he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> did i don't know i it was it was a weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing and i was like and so i asked the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guy i i went had like really angry dms </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with him back in full flight like so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can i use this did you [ __ ] me over like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know how much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how much this [ __ ] me like what am i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> supposed to do and so in the end it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> turned out yeah like i was in the wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i'd been sold this bogus license </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was like not real yeah and so then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like well [ __ ] what do i do now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i've just lost like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three or four i think it's three years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like youtube work it's just gone yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like just can't use any of it it's so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scary right yeah and so and so i made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this video like ranting being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] like what do i do that's just so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] i've been wronged et cetera et </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cetera and you know and i i asked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> youtube for help at the time they just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't help me and i was like what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] am i doing yeah and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> funny enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i had a youtube partner manager before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all of this went down it was really good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> surprisingly because normally they don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talk to you right and then that person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> left the company and then i got someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> new and they introduced themselves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through an email and they never heard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from them again as you know that's how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it always is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and so i i went on like a mini rant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in this video being like yeah youtube's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> useless they don't do anything i have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this youtube person they never talk to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me they don't help me at all after that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> video goes live i got an email from a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> youtube person who's like hey of course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hey i'm that person that you were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they were like yeah i'd actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like to help your situation out and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like oh okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> great awesome </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so they basically said hey so what we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> can do is we can go through every single </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and if you send me the file again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without the music in it we can replace </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i had to go through 200 videos and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> re-render them or just cut out the music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because some of the files i didn't have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the original files anymore yeah like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the adobe file or whatever like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah luckily a lot of the more recent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> ones the ones i liked and was more proud </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like yeah at that time the original </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> original file yeah so we like 200 videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on google drive linked in like an excel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spreadsheet and then we had to one by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one like swap them but this process </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> wasn't even wasn't like perfect either </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because videos got uploaded to the wrong </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> video all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so like so you'd click on a certain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> thumbnail and title and it took you to a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different video right it was like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was the original video yeah and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> they replaced it with another video that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> got put there yeah like i did like uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there was like a i remember it was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> attack on an attack on titan impressions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and euro nice impressions yeah they both </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got swapped so when people went to yuri </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on ice impressions it was just me doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> attack on type of things and then when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was when it was the other one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was it was the other video and yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sat there with youtube for like an hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to explain to them what was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happening because the subtitles also got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> swapped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so they were looking at the video only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the subtitles like the raw subtitle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> data yeah and they were like no no it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the right one you're talking about yuri </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on ice in the subtitles or something and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like no no no no the video the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> video is wrong yeah and i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> panicking and i was like i'm getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> tons of comments being like what the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] is going on and i'm like fix this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> did you not just like swap the titles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was just weird because all the entire </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> videos see what joey's gonna do with his </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> channel yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm like i wonder what the side effects </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are of this like so eventually we got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> all sorted yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just go on the channel and like why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is this attack on titan video got yuri </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> nice comments yeah like what's going on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there exactly so all the comments are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like that i remember yuri in an attack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right it's all weird and then so yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like again like two months later it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> finally all got done yeah yeah and we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did it some of the videos like i said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they couldn't be salvaged and the reason </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why it came to bite me back later was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because some outros in my videos now are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just mute yeah yeah you can't hear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> anything i'll see because like i had the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> exact same thing uh but after youtube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> introduced the whole muting thing yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i had my old old intro uh so my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> current intro now is made by my friend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from uni yeah who used to be like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> music producer and it's like not even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> out on like any website yeah so i know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like good it's like all you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> copyright free because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i had the exact same thing where like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> saw like i went on to like soundcloud </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i found like this really like bang a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> song yeah um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and uh and i was like i'll call use it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as a as an outro because it's like kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of wacky goofy like you know all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> gaming youtubers are using it at the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time and then of course uh that artist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got really popular on soundcloud </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because every youtuber was using it got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a major record label because of it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then the record label copyright claimed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all of my [ __ ] oh [ __ ] and uh and i had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and same thing i like dm the artist i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was like yeah so what's happening uh you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> said i could use it she's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but i'm like a big shot now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like i've got a major record label </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm unfortunate i can't do anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for you but luckily this was during the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time where again youtube introduced the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> muting thing so shitty of them to not if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you asked did you ask them permission </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> initially yeah yeah so i asked the uh so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i dm the artist initially when she was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just on soundcloud and she was like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> please go for it like i love that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just just you know obviously just the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] just like just like just link it in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the description you'll be all good i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh sorry that's very nice of her </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh and then yeah she was like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry that's uh my that's not that's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my decision that's my labels decision so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so then i had to yeah so like if you go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> back to like videos from like 2017 the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way i use that outro oh they're all mute </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> at the end yeah i've got a lot of videos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where i just me talking at the end i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> still got comments to say being like why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> does it like just go silent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean i've had to use that feature </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like some of my videos but like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> don't mute it i just like cut out like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the yeah now you can replace the music </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah you can replace the music because i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> believe i had to do that for trash taste </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> or something right because that got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> copyright claimed or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the specials or something oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and after dark as well for some reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> our intro for trash chase called </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> copyright claims and after that on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> twitch on twitter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> free song yeah it's a royalty-free song </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but which is like no no no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> well a couple right the corporate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> systems unfortunately like are really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> easy to abuse like you can stick out the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> old [ __ ] piece of music and start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> claiming [ __ ] and it's only until </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> somebody like stops you yeah yeah so you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> know it was really like the weirdest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> copyright claimed i've gotten is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like anime music that i've put into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my videos like like before like anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> osc's were just like free game because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japan the anime industry didn't really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> give a [ __ ] and now they're slowly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> coming to realize wait a minute </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> youtubers use our music </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how can how can this be so like now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime osts are starting to be claimed as </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> cover of you save right um and yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's i i'd like where do i even begin </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with that you know like that's uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean yeah like super early in my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> youtube channel i used to do like covers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of anime songs like on guitar and piano </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff like that yeah reason why i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't do that anymore is because the few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> times i ever got a copyright strike yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not a claim a strike was from a cover i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> did i did a cover of um i did a cover of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] paranoid android by radiohead </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it was the ending to ergo proxy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right and at the time it was like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> really liked it yeah and uh yeah i got a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] strike on it and i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not sure if that can also be a humble </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> brag because that's like saying like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are so good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally i thought it was the real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> thought it was the original song i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like thanks youtube but also what the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] i've had my voice claimed a few </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> times actually really yeah my own videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> people trying to claim my like they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like well i'm just talking there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nothing is that so you know va i've seen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> a tick tock of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> as one dude on youtube one time he he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> uploaded this original song and then got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> claimed by someone yeah someone claimed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> his original song right right that he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uploaded to his own channel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> well because anyone anyone could put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything called </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like these companies are given like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> know free reign yeah remember remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was like i forgot when it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe 2018 there was like that copyright </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> armageddon that was happening where yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah all these like fake companies were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like going around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean it's still happening because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not as bad as it used to be though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not it definitely isn't and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> glad like one of the positive things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> youtube has done is given creators tools </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like for example cut or mute the segment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that has been copyright claimed out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which we just didn't have before so if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we got a copyright claim before for like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a second of music then there was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like nothing we could do it was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like a dead video yeah man you know what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> companies suck well there's [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> viral hog in all those dudes the ones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that like buy viral videos oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> just go around claiming them like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> armageddon they're [ __ ] awful like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nine gag and stuff like that no no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like these you know you see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> those watermarks on facebook you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> remember that video of that dude </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> punching the kangaroo yeah bible uh kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like that but a bit different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because live bible they don't really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't normally go around copyright </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> claims yeah like that that video right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the the person who had that video sold </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it to this company right and then what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they do is everyone who's then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> uh talking about it or showing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll just go around copyright </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> claiming everything and any of these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> news networks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well that's what it's the business model </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like they they buy these videos for like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very cheap </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even like have you have you never had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> offers from people who want to buy your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll go around buying them and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just claim everything and it's just yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really [ __ ] because people react to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff on stream as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah that's true and also the worst </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing is about that luckily 99 cents you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> will never have to experience is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> these copyright claims right sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like really [ __ ] generous </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the timing on the video like so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they have to say what time in the video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they copyright collection yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes they'll add on like five or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> ten seconds oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like a piece of [ __ ] now i've got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to like this there's like a clear edit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and everything i've gotta edit out or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> mute [ __ ] because yeah because you don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> get to contest no time so whatever the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> time is that's like if you want to mute </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the the copyrighted content you don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get to say where it is yeah whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they submitted is it so one time on one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> video i remember i reacted to like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> clip or something on like on a live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stream or something on connor talk and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh they claimed it and i was like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's fair enough but then they claimed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 40 seconds extra i have nothing to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> do with said clip wow and i was like wow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> dude like really like like a force they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> own your reaction as well apparently no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> videos like that where i react shadow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i don't give a [ __ ] but yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like bro what are you doing don't claim </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] that isn't the video like come on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just lazy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the problem right it's like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like youtube has done a really good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> job of like trying to make the playing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> field as fair as possible right like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah only recently they added that whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how uh during an appealing process the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> money that the video accumulates goes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into what's called escrow which is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of what you should have done yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah which is kind of like it doesn't go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> person who is the supposed copyright </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> holder or the video owner it kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like is floating in the cloud until it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> resolved yeah it's it's just great it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like being put in the pool yeah no one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can get that until the uh copyright </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> situation is resolved which is fantastic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like at the same time even today i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> feel the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know the advantage is still in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> claimant yeah like clearly youtube is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah you know obviously if you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna go out of your way to claim </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something copyright wise then you must </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have a good reason for it but yeah a lot </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> episode back to the video um but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> speaking of like other changes that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> youtube has made oh yeah now the dust is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> settled on the dislike thing yeah so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like uh has dislikes been removed i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> very confused because i can still see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> them on my channel it's it's a slow on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your channel yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah on anyone else's channel though it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> should be completely gone no i can still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> see it on videos i think i mean let me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> check let me check right now i know i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> oh no it's gone no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no literally i was literally it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feeling that for days no no i literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i literally looked at [ __ ] videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yesterday and i was just like where does </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the dislike channel go when is the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> dislikes going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was yeah it was like it's getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like slowly implemented i think so not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all channel owners can see it but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least with your own content you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still see your dislikes which goes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> completely against the argument that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> youtube made as to why they wanted to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get rid of the dislikes because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember i made a video on a second </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> channel and one of the youtube's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reasonings for getting rid of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> dislike button was that like oh it you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know if you see dislikes on your videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it discourages smaller creators you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like perhaps you know they're getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dislike bomb perhaps they're getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bullied and no one likes to see a bunch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of dislikes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you can still see dislikes on your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> own videos so what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i'm just glad they're standing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up for the small creators all two of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> them or something that exists on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> entire platform of youtube um that have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever complained about this because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i was talking to this about with a bunch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of other youtubers and i was i asked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them do you know a single creator in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your field that has ever complained </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> about disliked bombs like whatever size </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and not a single person i know has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ever been like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ever been like a target of dislike bombs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the point where it actually actively </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> ruins their channel yeah you know have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you ever received a lot of dislikes yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean yeah for i mean because i feel me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and god make more opinionated videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah right so you know obviously there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> are some opinions i've said in the past </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that people yeah i'm very happy with you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> had a lot of dislikes on one video i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> had some videos that didn't do as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what what do you classify as a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dislikes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> more than like 10 percent yeah 10 is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> quite a lot yeah okay yeah i've had a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> few videos but not that much i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> have that much most of it is like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more the more controversial opinion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> videos yeah um but in people who didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like watch the videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think the only one was the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> christian one yeah yeah understandable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but uh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but yeah yeah no i've had a few </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's like it's but it you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> when i look back on those videos or like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how i presented them i can see why they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got dislike bomb and i don't really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> blame them for it i guess like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember like i think one that really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> blew up recently that got quite a few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dislikes i think it is like yeah nine to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> one is uh it's an old let's fight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> episode where the title of it is uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> berserk is not a masterpiece </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think he's just like and it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right now i think it's like 10 yeah 15 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dislike and it only blew up after miura </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sensei's passing right because obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> people were searching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and obviously if you watch the video i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> argue against you you'd know that joey </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like the biggest berserk simp yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like ever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that was the title i used that because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that was one of the opinions i got and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fought against it but clearly people you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know don't watch it all the way through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or up to that point so they just see the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> title and they think oh this guy hates </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> berserk dislike in some ways i you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i personally like the dislike button but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in other ways i think it doesn't really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do anything and it doesn't serve </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the only place you actively dislike the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> video yeah yeah yeah okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but here's the problem right for what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> reason yeah this is this is the problem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> right there's no agreed-upon consensus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on when you dislike right it's you could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dislike because you disagree with the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> opinion you could dislike because you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't enjoy the video as much as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> another one you could dislike because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you just don't like the person yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like it's the dislike although is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes helpful on a tutorial yes it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very black and white is the tutorial not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> good dislike yeah right when it comes to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like your videos i feel like the dislike </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bar </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't serve the same purpose as it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> does on a tutorial where information is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> actually important i i think it serves a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> purpose when you know like you really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] up you know again yeah again yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you've like purposely made like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> very controversial yeah yeah yeah the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more i think about it the more i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah okay in some ways the dislike </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dislike unlike bar is [ __ ] useless </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it doesn't mean anything it doesn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with 99 of videos i think is completely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> useless and only with tutorials and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> knowing when you [ __ ] up that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> literally the only reason well i mean i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean there is also some catharsis to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being able to dislike a video and just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you see sometimes you see a video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's so outrageous and you want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> know that you're not the only [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> person who thinks that this video is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this is a shitty video or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and you go to the dislike bar and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like thank god i'm not the only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one you know there is some catharsis </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like going on to a video and seeing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> comments are disabled and i'm just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] you but that's that that's way no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> balls </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the likes of this like bar is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing it's the comments that matter i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> think that and and when they come to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> disabled they get way more likely right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like to me it's like i i don't mind if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you disagree with an opinion i make on a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video but i would much rather you leave </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a comment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> explaining why you dislike it or why you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are against whatever i said in that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> video rather than just like leaving a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> dislike because as you said a dislike </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can mean a million different things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because you know sometimes people will </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be like this video wasn't as good as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> another one does that mean that that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> person disliked it and is that is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like fair because if i didn't like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video that someone made or i liked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> another one more i wouldn't personally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> dislike no i mean but that's how i do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me trying to like extrapolate any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> information from this random just metric </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that doesn't mean [ __ ] like it just it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't help me like when i see a video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that has 99.9 percent likes i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay now i see a video with 99.8 likes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's the difference here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like did they get just more likes than </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> previously or like less dislikes i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> really understand yeah but i mean like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think it is useful not in like the small </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> percentages but in like the large </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> percentages right because most videos on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> youtube should have like an above ninety </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> percent like ratio like like to this i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> think it's actually 99 it's like the is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like normally good 95 is where you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting to like all right maybe you've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> said something like a little bad if it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 10 if you have nine to one ratio you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> probably [ __ ] up oh no you haven't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] up you've just pissed off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> my experiences you've probably pissed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a group a certain community or a certain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> group you know and then you get to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the 50 percent and that's when you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that something big has like yeah because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> your core audience will always like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's yeah i mean that's really but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that doesn't necessarily like for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> example like you know a channel i like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to watch a lot of needle draw who does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like a lot of music reviews right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> he's had a couple of recent uh before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the dislikes disappeared he's had a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> couple of videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that were like you know 40 likes yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was still uh like a good video it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was just the thing his opinion about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously didn't you know coincide with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the general public about it right so but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like what does that as a viewer what do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i then gather from that video like right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like is this a bad video yeah is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> does it does he say something that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> flat out wrong did you say something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that a lot of people just don't agree </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> with like it doesn't really tell you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> anything it's a mixture of all those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah and that's why you have to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down into the comments after that to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like okay what is the reasoning behind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this massive dislike yeah but like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like youtube removing this way for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> viewers to express themselves or like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the distaste of a video they're going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> find other ways to express their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> distaste towards a video well yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm sure like rationing is just right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's it's going to now be a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> thing in the youtube sphere it's like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't already [ __ ] annoying yeah i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't wait to like comments to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> ratio youtube videos now because that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just that's what's going to happen you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> know it's it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> viewers always find out like audiences </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> always find a way to show their dislike </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's either the youtube comments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are going to get more toxic or other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> social media platforms that that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> particular youtuber is known to be on is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> going to get more toxic because like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> biggest thing that annoys me is you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the tutorials and stuff because that you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know you are very much removing an easy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way to discern whether a tutorial is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right or whether a certain video is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right because let's say let's say you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> upload a shitty tutorial or you upload a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> scam right you disable comments but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> likes and dislikes are still available </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are still up in the open so you you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of just like you you're just kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like taking a risk on whether you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> should listen to them right because you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know how many people are disabled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but also likes are very easy to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> manipulate as well like that's another </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing well but like the i would argue a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> smaller level yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i would argue that now that you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't even see the dislikes anymore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's not even a point of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> disabling likes and dislikes anymore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right because it's just in a constant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> disabled state right because it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you can only say like say for example </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was a scam video yeah if they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> disable the comments now what's the only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing you can see is the likes it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i mean you can't do anything about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it because like i i think youtube were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to go with something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> similar to what instagram did with their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> likes about making like likes not public </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> except for the poster and like for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> instagram i get it for that you know for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that platform i think it made sense </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they reverted it hmm they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> reverted it did they yeah when i can see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> all the likes yeah they reverted yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they reverted it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> since how long like a long time now holy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> under the impression that that was yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah well we can see how often </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> god goes on instagram it's no big secret </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that i don't go on instagram so uh i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> guess my point is now mute </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm glad you guys stopped me before i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was starting before i was going to start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> spewing a lot of balls </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no they shot for me they shot for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah they shot for me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think they might be slowly rolling it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> back out or you have to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe opt into it or something i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know but let's see okay that must be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> data that's [ __ ] that on their end right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that like says hey you know when people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> see likes it's good for us yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i i don't know what that is i can only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> probably it's probably if people can see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it just keeps them on the platform </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because viewers want to feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're having some like like they can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> contribute in some way shape or form </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> well they want to see a metric and they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to see that metric go up with the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with the youtube one the main </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> speculation was that brands weren't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> happy with the dislike bar yeah now i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i in some ways i feel like that's too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> easy of an explanation yeah i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> youtube in the past hasn't i i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think they've been that catering of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> brands </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know i could be wrong here i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like they must have some data that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> backs up that removing dislikes will </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lead to better views or something yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean because there's no way that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you should each team seems too selfish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to yeah to do something for brands it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> seems like i feel like it just happens </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to be no so uh so the youtube creators </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> uh channel on youtube made a video it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a three minute video that was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> very concise saying why they were moving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it yeah was it the dude who's like uh is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that the one that the guy was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sitting there yeah yeah the guy's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like sitting there being like this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the reason why we're gonna do it nice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and quick you know i give him props for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that at least it wasn't like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 30 minute explanation video yeah but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like they gave him another [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nick over yeah exactly exactly it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nice and concise which is nice but um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah one of the reasons they gave was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like oh yeah we saw a metric uh that uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we tested upon millions of users don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know how true that is that uh apparently </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the amount of dislikes does not change </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh the watch time of that video i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> believe that no i believe that yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm like yeah i mean of course i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you that's not a reason though to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> rid of it with dislikes yeah exactly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because i argued being like well yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what if you're watching like an apology </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> video that's like 40 minutes long right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> this i'm sure there's a lot of dislikes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on it but people want to see it until </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah i mean youtuber has one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> priority it's making people watch longer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah there must be some some evidence to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to prove that i do getting rid of it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> makes people watch that i did find it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> funny though that the last point they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gave that was like and the last question </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is did we get rid of the dislike button </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because of youtube rewind they brought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that point yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and dude i've never seen a guy say no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with such copium in my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he was like no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you can see the copy i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you could see how many times he had to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> film that to not to like sound genuine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to like get the most genuine take that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because he knew like people were going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be watching this under a microscope </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah at like 0.25 speed or something to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be like well the inflection in his voice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of leads me to believe that youtube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> made himself i heard a slight vibrato in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> his voice meaning he is about to start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crying at any minute </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i just wish they would uh tell us the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> truth and give us some data but they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> not going to do that why would we no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no i mean i mean what like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what no not not annoyed me but the way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really made me suspicious was the way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they framed it to like oh we're doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you guys yeah you asked for this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't don't thank us later please please </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hold the applause but we are helping you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for your mental health and it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like literally no creator i have talked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to or ever heard of like ask youtube to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do this and they framed it in a way that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they're doing it for their creativity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ever seen a youtube creator make a video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in front of the camera going guys my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mental health is deteriorating from all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these dislikes i'm getting man [ __ ] no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of course not it's the [ __ ] algorithm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like demanding youtube's to not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> take a break it's the one time a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> corporation has said don't worry guys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we've heard you and the cr the the the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> audience didn't actually say anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah we have been silent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you've had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's literally the i've saved the day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you haven't done anything they just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> leave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're welcome i'll see ya </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god so i've uh finally started to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> settle in my new place now oh yeah um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah we are 20 years later 20 years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> later you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um you know hosted uh the house warming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> unfortunately joey couldn't make it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you were busy with the uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i will say yeah lovely lasagna yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i will say ever since that day so okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so i don't know if i've told the story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the world famous lasagna yeah which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's not world famous but it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about to be okay it's now it's about to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> be so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> um so in japan i don't know why but you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> can get a lot of good italian food in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> japan but for some reason you just can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> get lasagna like no italian restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in japan for some reason serves lasagna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the few that they do they definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't serve good lasagna yeah so because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of this i would just like look i've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> living in japan for a year i'm craving </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> lasagna so what better way to do it then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just learn how to do it yourself absorb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> myself [ __ ] uh literally [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> thanos i'll [ __ ] do it myself right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so about a year ago i didn't even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> realize i was a fan of reference i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> said it is it a thanos reference yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the one where he takes a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and says fine i'll do it myself yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i haven't seen the movie i just see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that it's a pretty famous music this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the most generic line that could be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> attached to any character i could say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything i could be like oh my penis is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a little lychee's like i remember that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i'll do it myself after myself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so about a year ago i learned how to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cook lasagna and i cook it once right i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i cook it once and it was like it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like mediocre lasagna all right and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a difficult dish right yeah i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> lego but with pasta yeah it's it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's cool it's it's a it's a pasta cake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right it's just it's just concentrated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pasta with meat sauce </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that's kind of that's kind of what it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like all the flavor of pesto bowl </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> layers very precisely right yeah right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> deep doing quarantine uh sometimes we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would you know have have dinner parties </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where we we would invite people over or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just people would come over yeah and one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> day sydney cindy invites connor roven </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she says oh you could have some of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gant's world famous lasagna and i'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like and scott is like what i'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like what what do you mean world famous </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cindy i've cooked it once </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and ever since she said that because she </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't say it to connor she said it to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me lynn as well and so for like a good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> five months people have like people have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> built up this idea that i make world </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> i'll be a good host yeah but until the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> design is done nothing is happening and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um and so i cooked this on lasagna it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an hour after sydney had said that the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> designer would be finished i don't care </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't rush perfection </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then i and then i and then i finish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it and then i take it out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then this is a really weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experience people start crowding around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this lasagna right it's like oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people started crowding that around this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> design and you know i'm gonna say it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> looks [ __ ] good right no it's like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> mean i saw the photos it looks good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's the thing about lasagna right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that you know anyone who loves lasagna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> will understand is it the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> spatula the first serving is always the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> best one yeah because the more the more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people start chunking out that lasagna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the more sloppy it becomes yeah don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get me wrong it's not like lasagna is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the cleanest thing on earth yeah but the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first the first spatula scoop is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> best one yeah so you get the perfect </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> ratio yeah yeah yeah because like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know i needed to make sure like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cheese was like perfectly toasted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because it can't be like raw cheese and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the edges need to be like a little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bit crispy a little bit burnt right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's to me that's a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> lasagna you can't have like a completely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> raw but not too overburnt lasagna and so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i remember i remember finishing it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone's taking a picture i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> melin </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> chewing this lasagna and i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my life is like flashing before my eyes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right now and she's just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've leveled up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i can't explain the [ __ ] euphoria </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> wash dishes ourselves anymore and that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> takes so much of the effort out in the </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> like i find i find like i find cooking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> relaxing you know i actually find it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> relaxing to chop up the onions or chop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up the vegetables or whatever prepare </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the dish cook the dish it's the it's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> clearing up that is always put me off </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> used to [ __ ] dread it like i it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just like stressful even like following </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> somehow i [ __ ] it up in some regard i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know i was like i'm following the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recipe how does this taste like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah and but like now the more i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like slowly sounds like hell bucky cook </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like you know trying out like really </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> wow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of fun what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is this what is this what it feels like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be like good at something yeah and </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> people eating your meal and they're just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> enjoying it and feeling happy i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh this is how chefs feel oh my god oh </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> new hobby or something because it's uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> genuinely like a good feeling to cook </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> something that you're proud of and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> people also enjoy your cooking i get it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> now mom i get it okay i guess i am i get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> why you was always like eagle-eyed on me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever i'd like eat any of your meals </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> okay i get it now i like cooking it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> just a lot of work but also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um i i'm also really bad with portion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> control </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right when i make food i make food like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot like a feast yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i used to make a lot of lasagna from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> walls is that i would then eat lasagna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you make a little lasagna you know yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah but is it world famous </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> nobody's had it that's it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> well no no i'm curious now i'm curious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we're about to have a lasagna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> one time i made a lasagna right i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh i totally forgot to make the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> white sauce layer wherever right right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i was like why does this taste like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> bricks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because there was like no like white </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> layer to balance out the tomatoes yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah so i i would have make lasagna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i always liked leftover lasagna more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> than lasagna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> really something about lasagna sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that like the next day when you when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> heat it up it's like perfect yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause it's so thick right yeah it's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> thick it kind of gets i don't know try </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it guys it's like i i have tried it it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's like how leftover deep dish </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> pizza tastes better than the fresh deep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes yeah sometimes i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why but at least at least the lasagna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that i made i don't know maybe it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like are you talking about microwaved </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lasagna or do you just eat it straight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of the [ __ ] fridge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> uh i don't know like properly made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lasagna and then i would like put it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> back in the next day yeah i'll put it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back in the oven yeah yeah oh okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's good yeah i think maybe it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like the the the juices like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> coagulate yeah like solid it like seeps </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in right like you could like cut through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it like a cake yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> whereas lasagna that goes [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everywhere yeah i think we're wrong i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> might i generally prefer normal lasagna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but about when i used to make it that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for some reason i liked it the day after </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> more no i get that i don't know why it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like a hurry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> no i've heard that that's like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> biggest fallacy i've ever heard because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've had i've had day old curry it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely doesn't taste as good as like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what kind of curry though indian curry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right because i understand why okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> indian curry may not be the same because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in with japanese curry it's definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> better the day after yeah because it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's taken the time for like everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sarah are you uh sorry okay hong kong </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but like i was telling japanese curry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> tastes to say no matter what i feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so yeah i i feel like i've never had bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> curry but i've never had curry that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like made me like [ __ ] amazed about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> how good it is it is the most like six </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> out of ten cups there's some like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gourmet ones where they use like really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> rich stock and they have like really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like uh good quality beef bites yeah at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the end of the day it's still generally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's still a japanese car yeah exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um with pizza </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i do do you like i was wondering about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this because you know there's people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like purists they're like stone-baked uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh what's uh where was it from uh napoli </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> napoli like that's the only style that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the correct style which type of pizza is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> your favorite style i was just curious </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i do like stone base stone bait is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the only pizza where i can eat the crust </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay because okay because like some like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> sourdough stone bay pizza oh my god okay </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> like a new york pizza that's like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> best to be fair new york pizza is pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] bomb they i think american style </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of making pizza is the best way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i uh i love stone bake i love stone bake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right i love it don't get me wrong but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like there i don't know what it is about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> americans italians italians i i hear you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> italians like i thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a whole generation just like died </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> here's my argument right the thing with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the thing with stone baked pizza that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes kind of pisses me off why are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they so goddamn light with the toppings </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> and call it a day you know which i get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it you don't you don't like submerge it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but also everything falls off like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> immediately as well i think it's awesome </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> nothing stays in place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> isn't that based off </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> either napoli or the other type of uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> italian pizza but like it's not supposed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to be a heavy meal yeah it's supposed to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> be very very lovely i don't know which </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> one it is yeah i love the heaviness of </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> fresh honestly fresh [ __ ] pizza okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but okay but in japan no way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> no [ __ ] way am i listening to this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right now in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's in japan okay there's two types </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of pizza in japan right yeah there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pizza and then there's pizza yeah all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right two different things no i'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you guys are but it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like an hour left on this recording can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we order a pizza hot pizza with sausage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the crunch i actually want to try it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just saying we should do it we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> should all have a live reaction yeah why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why not because i want to see your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> reaction i want to see your hot dog </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> crust pizza it's a hot dog crust pizza </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> camera have your head on i've never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tried it yeah i want to see how have you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> never tried it because i barely eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> cheesy crust i just want like a regular </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crust i'm pretty sure they have it man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm telling you why do you like cheesy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> crust it's too heavy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you want a hot dog crust no honestly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like it's so good it's like a very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> tight hot dog it's like so it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wrapped around it's like a bite-sized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hot dog it's like a hot dog burrito bro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i need to check if they still have yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> so so in japan right there's there's two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> types of pizza there's pizza which is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like stuff like pizza hut domino's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> american pizza basically right and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's pizza which is the italian pizza </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah right so like when if you ever go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like a an italian like restaurant or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever or establishment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you'll be able to know the difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> between like the italian like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stone-baked stuff that god likes and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then the american stuff that conor likes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so at least gusting at least japan has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like made a distinction being like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> know at least they're not one of those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> countries that are like all pizza is the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> same like i remember when i first went </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to new york right and i had my first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like new york pizza and the selling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> point of this pizza uh was that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could literally just kill your face you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could literally tilt the pizza and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could see the oil dripping off it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm just like how is this a selling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> point you're meant to make this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> appetizing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is just pure fat that's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> rolling off now i i but i went to a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> place in new york that was like i guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like kind of famous in new york i forgot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what it was but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's they're famous for like dabbing the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oil off pizza off the pizza so it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really really it's it's a massive pizza </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's really thin and really light </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so like i don't know about like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> full or like oil dripping off thing like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if that was a good point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like the point is you're still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> dabbing off the oil because there is so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> much oil on the pizza right right and to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> me that's that's not that's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> appetizing i don't know like when i see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that much oil on anything that just i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't want to eat it you know i i can i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> can feel i can feel my arteries just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> clogging up as much as like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a place called pizza slice in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shibuya that's really good that does uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> new york style pizza [ __ ] bomb i can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only go there maybe like once a month </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> though because my god after two slices i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> am like about to explore look look i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get it where you know i i get that it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a nice fast meal it feels good it feels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unhealthy but to say that it is better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than stone baked pizza that's where i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> draw the line man no [ __ ] way if i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had to choose oh god so hard i just i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like pizza in general yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's all delicious </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm not saying that stone bait is not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> delicious yeah it is yeah i'm not i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not saying that new york pizza is not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> delicious as well in its own way because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like both types of pizza have their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> benefits because because like the only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing can be an everyday meal the the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only pizza that i'd say the americans do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the best is chicago pizza she can't push </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but like that's like that's not even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's not even nowhere else even does </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it not a pizza it's a pie no no yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly it's it's not a pizza it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> pizza lasagna but it's a pizza lasagna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what that's what chicago deep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> dish pizza is and that's why it's </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> american pizza style american pizza </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> style that i i love so much yeah i get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that like i love i really really miss </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> domino's pizza in the uk it was so good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i love that pizza what's different about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it in the uk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know i don't know why it's so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> good i i don't know i think it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> biased i think it just tastes the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's me i i did you like i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> had dominoes around like lots of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> different places and they all kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> taste so i i had little caesars pizza in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> america right and i thought it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> delicious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the mini pizzas the bigger ones are the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bigger ones like five dollar for like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> large right and everyone was saying like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bro it's like the worst pizza on earth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i actually like like it i like oven </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pizza it's not really great i had it i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> liked it i liked it i'd much rather </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> dominos than literally i like little </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> caesars it was and also i'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> convinced you don't have taste buds no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like the the more the more you talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the more i'm just like no no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> also </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my enjoyment of it also increases </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> knowing that for all of that for five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dollars that's insane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the taste is good and it's only like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's only heightened by the fact that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's simply five dollars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for this massive like this could feed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the entire [ __ ] last supper this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> little caesar pizza yeah because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not that good that doesn't affect the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> taste i don't know it does it most come </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on dude you go to a place right the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> price affects the way you see the food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it does yes like when you get that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly why little caesars taste like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> five dollar pizza it's not that great </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you get a dollar slice in new york yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it is foolish of me to act like knowing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it was one dollar didn't contribute to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my enjoyment of that yeah of course but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it was amazing you don't go to a new </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> york pizza place and be like i would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like an exquisite meal right now please </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one dollar oh what a steal is it because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> stone bay pizzas are not big enough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that is one big factor is that it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not okay so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so hypothetically if you found a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> restaurant here in japan or wherever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that does stone-baked sourdough pizza </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was the size of a new york pizza </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but also they skimp out on the toppings </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot right no i mean the problem with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in japan they definitely do but if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've had if you've had like stone bait </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in england like in europe and a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the time they skimp out they're like i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you don't put enough toppings on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's not like there's like the sauce </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is generous enough i'd say but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cheese like come on man you know i i had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> stones in italy and they stacked that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] because i haven't i haven't been to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> italy but like the best stone baked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pizzas places i go to they don't skimp </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the cheese they don't scream pound </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the toppings because you're in like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> british british version of it so they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like they fix it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the one i had in northern italy was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> packed was it really yeah it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every time i've had one in italy it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's been like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like very lacking in toppings really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and i think you're going to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right places yeah i don't know like and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like as the person who is like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> biggest simp for bread like how does </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that not play a factor in how these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> pizzas taste oh so that's more of a i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would say stone baked in many aspects in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my mind it's more about enjoying the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bread than it is about the pizza like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't even consider it like right right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to a point where i'm like it's flavored </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bread i'd rather just get like bread </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like at this point you know just give me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the give me a real [ __ ] pizza bro if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it doesn't give me like five spots the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> next day it isn't a pizza bro i want to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] me up with this pizza </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what you know what the world's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right british people don't have taste no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm just like you know what's confirmed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm too american with this one man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm american all the way on this one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from american pizza it goes hard it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't it doesn't look like there's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a time and a place for an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> american pizza every time hands down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> every day there is there is a time and a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> place for american pizza but every day </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> because i'm [ __ ] dumb it's not a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> argument it's a great answer it's not a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> great argument </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's quite in fact the opposite you're a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good person with a [ __ ] this is a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> preferential thing i just think the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pizza is better it's not flat out not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> saying okay look i'm not saying american </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> pizza is bad i love this this is not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> what we are doing both pizzas are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> fantastic right in their own unique </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> place like it is so far beyond belief to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even insist that america pizza could be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> interpreted as better than stone baked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you mean like that's just a wild clay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not wild </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people like american pizza more than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> stone babies because they've never had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> stone baked they have had stone bags </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i want to see how many people i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you'll be shocked by the amount of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> viewers that actually think america i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> want to set up how many people how many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of our viewers who have had both can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> agree with you and say that the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> americans your head your head's in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> cloud would you would you say domino's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is better than stone bay pizza then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in my in my mind i would rather a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> domino's pizza than stone baked pizza </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and i have seen right i remember i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> remember as well i thought i felt so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gratify like like hey i'll get this man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some taste buds i felt i felt so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> relieved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who's that guy who's like 1500 netflix </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shows the uh i think he's a chef from uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think japan but he's he's american the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bearded guy yeah yeah i forgot his name </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there was like one one scene right where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he was doing a whole thing about pizza </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he went around reviewing all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different types of pizza and there's one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time one scene where he's like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the end of the day though there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just something about a domino's pizza </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that'll just go so hard and i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yes yes that's probably a reason why we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't remember his name pretending like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> domino's pizza or these like fast food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> pizzas taste like [ __ ] you just clean i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> never said that we never said we never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> said that it's it's like it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saying a mcdonald's burger is better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> than like a gourmet freshly made burger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> at a burger joint you know like yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a place for it but to to say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that is better is like i've had many </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> burgers where i would prefer the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mcdonald's burger over said burger well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yes of course because a lot of the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're just like yeah let's just get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some like good beef i should like not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> consider the ratios or anything let's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> put like [ __ ] let's put like 500 no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> what i'm saying what the argument we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> making is think of the best burger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've ever had that wasn't mcdonald's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and put that next to a mcdonald's burger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> which one would you like i've had a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of pizza uh in italy that wasn't stone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> baked that i think was much better than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stone baked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was more yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean weird style it's like it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the heaviness of it yeah stone baked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't the only type of pizza but to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely it is like the pinnacle i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] i [ __ ] love stone cakes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the best bread and you know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's because it's like the best bread </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the best cheese used to come from a man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who can't appreciate the crust like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> comes from like i feel like you've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> already tasted the pizza it's because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] tastes like because i don't eat the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> crust that i can appreciate a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good stone break because it's the only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pizza that i eat the crust okay you have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's like watching a veganated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> chicken wing it's like oh my god there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a monument it must be a really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> good chicken you don't even appreciate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bread so how can you even have an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> opinion on what's better pizza like you </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] same you know that's but it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like when i i'm afraid i don't have to </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> eat this that's how world war three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> began to me i can't eat bread by itself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of times it needs to be flavored </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay it needs to have some butter on it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like for example a baguette i need some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> butter with that baguette a lot of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> times okay pretzels they have salt okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> no you can't just eat a baguette like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> good baguette with butter no just a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> bigger just eat a bite i can't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> okay with the crust you know with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> crust you're not eating you know it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not like you have the pizza part with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the cheese and you know and the toppings </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything and then you have the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> crust part right that's a very small </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ratio to the whole pizza itself i can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eat a pizza sized crust no matter how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> good like the [ __ ] stone baked crust </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i can just chow down on the whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> baguette like strawberry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> genuinely yeah i think you if you if you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had fresh bread like good bread i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you'd change your fresh bread is good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but like like not like [ __ ] tesco </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> bread no no no no no i've i've had fresh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bread but bread to me it's like fresh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> bread i'm i'm skeptical now where have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you had this fresh bread okay so you you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you had fresh bread yesterday no that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was that was [ __ ] great could i eat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more than just the slice that we got no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that was that was too much and with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> slice you know i i [ __ ] i gotta </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> destroy that whole plate i cannot i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> can't yeah i could have had that that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like wait every time i go to an italian </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> restaurant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i've had many meals which i've enjoyed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the bread like an amount where honestly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if the rest of my food didn't come out i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> would be happy every time i go to an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> italian restaurant in america and they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> always give you that like the plate of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bread i'm just like more i need more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this is not gonna be enough bread to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is a starter it is a starter it is not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the meal you can't just have bread as a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meal this man would not know who i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> offending with this take right now but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to me like the entire middle ages i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't just have peasants in the 1800s </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pure bread as a meal i'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like if you were born in the 1700s in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> europe you would be so dead i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> think we're going to have enough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> dinner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys made such you guys made such a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> big [ __ ] deal about this pizza thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i didn't think was a big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> deal man walks in here being like bread </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is [ __ ] okay okay like straight up like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what like you don't even have like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> gluten allergy or something or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] like that to like behind but i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't say bread was [ __ ] i said bread </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is not a meal he said 90 of bread and i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> quote taste the same okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> okay i'm gonna go back on that statement </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ninety percent of spread does not taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the same how many percent huh how much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> percent but i mean like 87 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> with bread i can't have bread as a meal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like having pure rice as a meal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as an asian i can't just have rice as a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> meal i know people can just have rice as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a meal but you need some stuff you need </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> some [ __ ] seasoning on the rice you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know you need some flavoring you need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something to go with the rice i can have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> rice as a meal yeah i know you can but i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know i know you can but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bread doesn't fill the same like role as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> rice right it literally does no it does </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> literally no it doesn't it doesn't yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean like i i'll completely disagree </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that all bread tastes the same or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever but i can agree that all rice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> tastes the same yes okay i i would i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> would say most right really yeah really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that is that is there is different types </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of rice yeah yeah but yeah like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously i can tell the difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between like japanese rice and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> saffron but it's like rice pudding and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all that [ __ ] as well that's all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> nonsense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean is rice pudding even rice said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that that's the point comparing the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> roles that bread and rice phil is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no it's completely different it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> totally different i can't believe you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're japanese joey you're going to say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that all rice tastes the same where a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> huge part of japanese cuisine is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the subtle differences in how the rice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tastes hey yo that's all [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> every time you go to a [ __ ] gyokan or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anything and you get like the massive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> meal and they bring out the [ __ ] bowl </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of rice and it's like this is the this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is the top branded rice of this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> prefecture and i take a bite and i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like bro this tastes like you are wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it does not taste it tastes exactly the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you're chowing down on it too [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fast to appreciate the subtle [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> taste it's literally just carbs it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just that's what bread is that's what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bread is literally just calves it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally just carbs it's so much more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than that whereas rice is just pure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> starch right bread has so much more that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goes into making a good bread right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've got all the different ingredients </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> anymore right rice is just like 100 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> starch right no because there is subtle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> differences into how to cook </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but no no rice like if someone if if we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brought out two bowls of rice right and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> one was from like [ __ ] you know octa </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> prefecture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i could not tell you the [ __ ] no it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not just about the type of rice it's how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you cook it as well which is why you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know sushi rice tastes different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> depending on which sushi place you go to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because sushi rice tastes different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's got vinegar in it no but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that that it's cooked with vinegar it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seasoned with vinegar yeah obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so it's part of the cooking process </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two if there was two bowls of sushi rice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one from akhtar and one from nagano you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> can't tell the difference that's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saying if two pieces of bread were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cooked exactly the same then they you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know then they taste the same which they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would because they cooked exactly the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> same way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i feel like both of these arguments are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] stupid yeah they are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i just realized both arguments here i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just realized i'm losing my brain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm losing my mind in this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> conversation now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i i think i i do agree though rice is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> less uh what's the word diverse diverse </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> than bread like the bread has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> way too many i'm saying but like my core </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> argument is that i can't eat bread as a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> meal it's the same way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the same way as eating rices and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i genuinely believe you haven't had good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bread like genuinely i have had good i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't think you had was the bread we had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yesterday good that was even compared to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> german bread that's mid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> was that was it good bread yesterday i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> thought it was kind of good it was good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was good it was good right don't get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me wrong it was good bread but i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> telling you man i i i've been i've never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been to germany so i don't know like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i spent a lot of a lot of my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> childhood in germany and i can tell you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man it's [ __ ] good it's so good like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every time i go to german restaurant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like amazing because it's like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> only thing that germany does well right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is the three foods that german like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> specialize in beer which is food there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not a drink it's food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you have bread and then you have meat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like just the meat is good right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sausages right right yeah [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing yeah right great sausages and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a reason why they stick to three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things because they [ __ ] do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing the bread is insane everyone's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like french baguettes no french </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> german bread is like 20 000 light years </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> ahead right of it it's it's not even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> comparable so could you what if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could have bread as a meal why don't you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> then you're saying you're on variation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right you want like different things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like if you just have bread every day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you'll get bored but i can easily </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have bread occasionally as a full meal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if i needed to really if i if it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> german bread yeah no qualms about it </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_02> it's like a side story now yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after our housewarming party </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um you know we we got a pretty merry and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was one thing i had forgotten </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> about japan because in my previous place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i lived on like a high enough floor that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i didn't need to worry about bugs or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wildlife or that kind of thing because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh because you know nothing could ever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reach yeah reach the top floor of my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> apartment at the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so i forgot that uh japan has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> cockroaches </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right i sure do guys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i had completely forgotten that japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had cockroaches right and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what we found out was uh during the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> party we didn't close one of like our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> windows fully so the window was slightly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> ajar and we had left the food out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um unlike in thailand where we were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> taught to you know clean up everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every day because cockroaches can come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> living in a house we had forgotten that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cockroaches can come because we are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> living on the bottom floor yeah where a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of cockroaches are unfortunately i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean it's a pretty new house so we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't have any we didn't have to worry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about that before um and i didn't notice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this or i didn't know this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until me and sydney were having dinner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the next day you know we kicked a nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meal sydney had kicked a nice meal um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and we were enjoying this curry that she </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had cooked and we were like chowing down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um and then i look over and in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> corner of my eye i see a black speck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> move about right and i and i move over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i look over and there's a fat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] cockroach </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> how fat are we talking it's it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about it's about that size okay that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty easy that's a decent size it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a it's a decent it's a decent-sized </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cotton crush moved in yeah i i had just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> moved in and i literally got i i i got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ptsd because if if if you don't remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i had had a previous experience with a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> cockroach in thailand the famous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> cockroach yeah if uh if you want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> check that out there's a clip where i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell the story but i i had had a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> previous experience with thailand in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thailand with a cockroach um and it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't a pleasant experience at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and i remember seeing this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cockroach and sydney was like see sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like chatting away to me and uh she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like gone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gone and i just like i was just silent i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was just staring at this cockroach </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then she she like starts getting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> angry go on listen to me and before and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she says that and then she looks over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we're just both staring in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> silence and then and then it's as if the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cockroach knew that we were looking at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it it was it was it was flexing because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we lo as soon as sydney looked over it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just crawls away into the air </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> conditioning in one of the holes and it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just disappears </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we and me and sydney are just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how do we burn this entire house down we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can't burn this entire house down we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just [ __ ] moved into this place right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the cockroach literally did an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> understandable habitat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and discovery and me and sydney were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just sitting here in silence we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like war veterans right because we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like we we literally escaped again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah we literally escaped this country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh we literally escaped thailand so we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't have to experience this again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and here we are moved into our new </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> place where it's we've been here for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a month and we have a single </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cockroach in our house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] what do we do so um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so we sit there for about an hour being </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well do we move out again um is is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a viable option like how how what does </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the contract say right and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> eventually i'm just like i started going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on amazon and i buy like every cockroach </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> related </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um products i can find in terms of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cockroach traps cockroach sprays even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> though i've had previous experience with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cockroach phrase i started really never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> works i start reading </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some of the [ __ ] are built like brick </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] yeah you could put the whole thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if terraformers have taught us anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that [ __ ] don't work yeah they are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> invincible yeah so like i started doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> research about japanese cockroaches and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know if sprays actually work or if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> traps actually works because um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> my experience with cockroaches in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thailand is that sprays don't work at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] all and uh it can actually make </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the situation worse yeah um and just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like scream yeah they just they just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scream they're gonna go in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and so that was so i order </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything and i just try to forget </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about the cockroach but like but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that night me and sydney slept with like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> one eye open like we could we couldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> sleep that night because we were just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like how can we sleep knowing that there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is a [ __ ] cockroach </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> downstairs you know what what happens if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i go to the toilet and i see it or i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just hear it scuffling about you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like so dark yeah so in the dark so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so uh we finally go to sleep and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first thing in the morning i go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> downstairs to go to my office because my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> office is on the bottom floor and my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> living room dining room is on the second </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> floor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and i go downstairs and what do i see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the [ __ ] it's right in the center </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of my living room it's got a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> balls </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it has got a lot of balls right on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kitchen and i [ __ ] freeze up i'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how do i get rid of this cockroach what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> would i do now i don't have my spray i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't like i don't know i'm kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scared that it's just gonna like run off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe it's gonna fly and like like me in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the face again like maybe it's going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> be my similar experience to what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happened in thailand yeah i'm getting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out the shoes yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm getting it yeah and i and i'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i don't understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i'm like i'm like looking around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what do i do do i do i try and kill it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do i chase it away what do i do and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i like trying to like ninja my way down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right and as soon as i try to do that it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> sees me and then it starts running right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it starts running and then i look at it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i realize wait a minute this is it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> running so [ __ ] slowly because my my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experience was with thailand cockroaches </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that like they're like [ __ ] sonic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like [ __ ] like speedy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] this cockroach is running </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at full speed and it was just running </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'm like and and then and then i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i corner it so it runs the other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> way because i'm still afraid that he can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fly and i chase it towards the stairs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and i assume that it's just gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get to the stairs and fly off it it goes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the edge of the stairs right and this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stupid [ __ ] right it it tries to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go on the side of the stairs and it just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drops </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right it just drops right and i'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like wait a minute these [ __ ] can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they can't fly and they're slow as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then suddenly i'm like i'm starting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to feel myself i'm like all right all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right maybe i got a chance here maybe i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't need the cockroach spray i can get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rid of this by myself so eventually like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this the cockroach right now is on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bottom floor so it's like it just it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not even flying it didn't even like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fly down it just like it just walked to </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> you get like a little meal at the end </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i like it i like it i never i'd never go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to a restaurant and look look a waiter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> in the eye and be like can i have the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> option with the hot dog in the class but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if i can if i can call up a pizza place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and tell them hey can you send it with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the cr for some reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i think i've figured out your taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is you need some like variety in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it you can't just have like even if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> something tastes amazing you can't just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> have that same thing no i mean i i can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eat bread like straight up just say that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> except for bread apparently yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like two ends of the spectrum </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's either no variety or too much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> variety this is what half and half is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing as well like i love half and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> half like who doesn't want half and half </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know one half i don't like half </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and half i don't like why would you not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> want like two different flavors because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because because why not why not just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> order the superior flavor yeah and just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stick on the two flavors are amazing and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i want to experience both </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one one flavor is always the best so i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> ordered that flavor yeah and that's all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i need because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i agree because because like because if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have half an hour half and half </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> never very rarely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never by choice it's always at a party </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> right because you need variety at a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> party right yeah but like i often find </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that halfway through a pizza especially </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a heavy one i kind of need something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> else to kind of mix it up so that i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not tasting just the same same same same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing but that's what dip is for right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah well different i mean i love dip </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> too when i have pizza i want like every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> dip on the table like yeah and i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> dunk dunk exactly well for me if i have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the same thing but it's an amazing same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing then i can just eat that endlessly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> until i'm sure but because pizza is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that style of pizza we just had is quite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> heavy like getting four or five slices </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of that in you're like all right i need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a chicken no it's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> stone babies yeah yeah yeah but i'm not </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> better it's like god was waiting for him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> now is the time to strike that's right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you fold up a stone baked pizza into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one into like one little ball it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one slice of a normal american pizza and </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> entire an entire meal of breadsticks it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> depends how good the best breadsticks </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> cardboard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> sorry i'll have gone but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm just i'm just wondering when we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ordered um we ordered uh it was napoleon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> style pizza from around uh not too far </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> away there's a few chains of them around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was awful oh yeah yeah really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] it wasn't that great they're so bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah well i mean it's japan right and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> don't even know that i was going for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like that was going for like stone baked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but not stone baked that was a really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> weird hybrid remember that it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it looked like it looked like a stone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> bake but it didn't taste like it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like it's like it looks stone-baked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but here's an oven </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of pizzas i find don't have a very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> discernible cheesy taste and i l i want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be able to taste the cheese right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah same that like a lot of pizzas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> either either because that's also when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you put too much topping on the pizza </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah like you can't taste anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because you taste like meat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's too much i need to taste all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> flavors in unison yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> so like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there needs to be like a right ratio of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like crust yeah sauce and cheese and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> toppings as well yeah exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> otherwise otherwise </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are some pizzas i see where like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's basically just you know cheesy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bread and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i know that's a type of pizza i'm gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get a pizza that's just cheese right oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you can also get margaritas and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cheese pizza yeah which is just which is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just uh sauce yeah cheese yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't understand the [ __ ] with that yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't [ __ ] with that i don't get that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i guess that's if you're like i want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have a pizza but i don't i don't feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> too bad about it it's like the people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> who get a pizza and they just scrape the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> toppings off right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually i'm like what happened to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in your childhood yeah just get a pasta </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> see if sydney does that i die a bit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> inside every time i see you just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> dunk your bread in some pasta sauce like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just bring like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just bring like a [ __ ] pasta like one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of those sauce pots with you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why ruin some pizza like don't do that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> this is not how i intended the new year </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for to start by the way i did not think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i'd be honest i i intended to start this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's not trash taste without an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> argument about food like i i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> who had the most clown opinion this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> no 90 percent of bread taste the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> all rice tastes the same bro come on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> italian pizza american american pizza </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone was a clown today ladies and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> gentlemen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was a clown i'm glad we called this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> trash taste it shields us from a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> criticism oh yeah let's just say that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yes because we say something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you can say all you want guys but we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> trash days </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what did you expect i i like how we made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the name in preparation of us having </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like shitty anime takes and like none of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> us intended to ever talk about food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> online right everyone is so scared to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> give their like genuine opinions on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i'm talking like not just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> politics and all that yeah [ __ ] whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't give a [ __ ] about like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> unimportant tell me your weird food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> taste that you have that is really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> honestly it's quite bizarre but you die </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by it like like everyone has these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> things yeah everyone everyone has a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> weird taste because they were they were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you know brought up in a certain way or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> they're not so familiar with a certain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> type of cuisine or you know sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taste buds don't always make sense you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can't have there's no there's no such </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> such thing as objective taste buds one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of my favorite dishes as a child that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the most british thing i'm about to say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay my mum would just make mashed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> potatoes and spam </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just mashed potato in the spam and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just mash it all up and just give it to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me that's it like the whole place should </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that be fair it does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> sound like oh it could be good but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's really [ __ ] i don't think i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could eat that like repeatedly i can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> well yeah of course you can it sounds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like something where if you didn't eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it as a kid but you wouldn't like maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she couldn't eat that just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the only reason i like is because i had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it since i was a baby </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> can you convince kids to like any food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i believe you can how do they convince </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you to like natto but they can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> convince kids to like broccoli and stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and because the people who don't like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> broccoli are babies they are they are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> actually absolutely yeah they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> actually babies </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> i like it maybe honey you know what it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> big brain what kids love slime </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> think about it yeah every single youtube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> channel for kids is slime i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a conspiracy i'm getting the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] red bull bro that's why kids in </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> like maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> broccoli or were we talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> broccoli yeah yeah maybe broccoli just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't taste good as like the main part </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of the world the case with broccoli </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't it the fact that like because kids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> taste buds are more receptive to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bitter flavors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> as an adult and then and then as you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you like broccoli yeah i love broccoli </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> of broccoli and just pouring a bunch of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mayo but i've ordered from that chicken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and broccoli place it's all over japan </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> yeah and it's all prepared so they just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> heat it up and send it to you yeah and </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no i i [ __ ] hate mayo normally but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> living in japan keeping me alright well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i [ __ ] keeping mayo [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing yeah and like it's me it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i've just had shitty mayo my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> entire life what do you put it on what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do you what do you mail with so whenever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's in a sandwich right yeah yeah okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> next time you ever have steamed i feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i'm asking mark zuckerberg what is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being happy like uh in a sandwich </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> initiate happy process </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no okay next time you have chicken and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> broccoli just get some cupid mayo and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just like don't even have to drench that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] just like a little bit is enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the mayo is already powerful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right you have a flavor just a little </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bit wait wait wait when we get uh fried </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> chicken do you not like it with mayo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no because i like the taste of fried </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean i was really good at like uh kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of combating the oiliness of it and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah somehow that's why a lot of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> another oily heavy liquid yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of mitigates yeah that's why like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with karaoke for example you always dip </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it in mayo all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't because just because i like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> taste of fried chicken oh with the mayo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's [ __ ] it's kind of nice it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing i don't know there are some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> things where i i said i just like if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's seasoned correctly then i i enjoy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that right because then then i enjoy the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taste of the seasoning rather than the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> taste of the condiments you can't expect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's like it's like it's like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have i'll have some of the chicken on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> its own yeah i also have some of it with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the mess yeah just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> try it out all right i did it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the palette like i've said if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something tastes [ __ ] good i can eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that thing infinitely that's like what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> children do yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah sorry my taste buds actually work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> on her so no no no no i would argue they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't work because you're able to eat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the same thing over and over again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if it's good not if it's bad if if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something tastes good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't eat it over and over again eat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> every day i can't i can't just go back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to it like you know so how like why do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you think it's so easy for me to eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like i can easily eat the same meal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every day right now i'm like eating a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> salad every day and it's fine it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] easy because salad tastes great </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like salad is like inoffensive it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's like it's like saying oh i can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> have water every day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i do have water every day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not gonna lie i'm not really on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> board with that argument i'm gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> distance myself from that argument </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's this [ __ ] salad you know you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't expect like the most like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> grandiose like combination of flavors </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> unless you like drench that [ __ ] in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dressing well i mean i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> other than that it's just like standard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> vegetables i can eat the thing is i can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eat like some foods </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i i found this salad place and i really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> liked it and i ordered it like maybe 10 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> days in a row i want to say the salad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then now for some reason when i try </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and eat it i know it's really good but i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just don't like it anymore why is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because you got you got bored of it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but isn't that sad well that's why you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't eat the same thing every [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> day you're so damn good if it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something that i [ __ ] love i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> purposely try not to eat it often but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the reason i think the reason why i went </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because there's nothing because there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing because there's nothing that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> terrifies me more than one day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sitting in front of my favorite meal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having a bite and going [ __ ] it doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> taste as good i just i i just i the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> reason why right here's why his wife </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> okay if it was a pizza i wouldn't do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every day you know why pizza is bad for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you oh yeah salad's good for you so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was like don't mind if i do round eight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay and then yeah i got bored of it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i regret it because now i have a harder </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> time fighting healthier food that i like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eating so i really [ __ ] myself over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's like that's that's the real </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> problem when you can't have a salad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> anymore </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> well that one type of salad that one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> type of thing because because like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> biggest issue is that you know i have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> force myself to have a balanced diet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i can i can easily eat something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the same thing every day if i really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> really enjoy it yeah it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i could [ __ ] face </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it no i'm not okay i could do this every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> day yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i could [ __ ] eat lasagna every day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm not going to say it's healthy or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> balanced but i can do it and i'm going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to eat it of course it's healthy of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> course if mom made it of course it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> healthy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> papa john's eat a pizza every day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he's still alive somehow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> he's just the world's most greasiest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> human being that's all [ __ ] hell oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> what a [ __ ] awful episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this has actually been probably the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> worst episode of trash days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of takes i hope you guys are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ready for 2022 because it might honestly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just get worse from here bro i feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i've got some concrete in my stomach i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know what it was from that i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> eaten today but it's probably the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] pizza right no no no it couldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> have been that that was the best thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i've eaten that was the heaviest slice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of pizza i've had in a while it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> amazing it was good for another one yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> can't believe but that's a problem in </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> that's true </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so offensive little caesar's out here i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mean it might honestly be a blessing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because if it costs the same as an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> american pizza yo i'd be like 500. it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the biggest deterrent in terms you know </SPEAKER_04>
