<SPEAKER_04> episode yeah yeah speed off every if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your being linked from our main channel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> videos hello local podcast um but if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> haven't seen our main Channel videos do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we want to explain what we did oh yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> sure so basically on our main channel we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> decided to do like a little fun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> challenge where as you can see our </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> backdrop is a little bonus this is a big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> table that has a lot of potential space </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be filled up with some Wiebe [ __ ] yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so what we decided to do is we decided </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to venture out into the web land itself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Akihabara in Tokyo which is like known </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as like heaven for tacos as it is and we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> decided to challenge ourselves to see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how many figurines or I guess anime much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we can buy with a $500 budget or about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 50,000 yen if you convert it to yes and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just instead of just going out of making </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it like a vlog kind of thing we decided </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to turn it into a challenge where we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fight each other let's make it fun let's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> make it challenging and let's make let's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> put some stakes on that's making the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> relaxing experience into stressful Hell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where you guys shoot they don't want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> meet a dumb set of criteria so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> essentially we gave ourselves a number </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of challenges we had some small </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> challenges that we did in the four anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> stores that we went to in our main </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Channel videos again if you want to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> check it out go check it almost a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> context if you don't watch that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but if you haven't seen it and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> refuse to for some reason you'll still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> be fine to watch this clock yes so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically we all have scores already </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from challenges that we went to with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we did in each store which is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably on screen right now yeah you'd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know that if you've watched our videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but here are all our scores yep but it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not the final score like any good mario </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> party game right it doesn't matter how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> many stars you end up with it's all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about the final count it's all about the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bonus stars and this episode is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> essentially where we go over the bonus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> stars as well as show each other what we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got because right now we don't know what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the [ __ ] each other got no we maybe got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a few glimpses as we like past each </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> other passive-aggressively in each of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the stores but right now we have no idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what the other person board yes so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's what we're gonna find out today </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> so we have a bunch of overarching </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> challenges right yes so we have some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that like pretty obvious like who spent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the most on a single figurine what was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that what who bought a figure from the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most popular series which will you lose </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a point if that's the case nor me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> awarded normal or we'll go over every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> challenge at the end after we've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> finished showing everyone what we've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> bought um but for now I just wanted to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ask you guys we just filmed it yesterday </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah how did you guys find the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experience I mean I found it super fun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that came out like I haven't started </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> editing the video yet as I am recording </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this episode but I can already tell that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> video is gonna be so [ __ ] fun too </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I feel like it's just fun like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's like the narrator you can see I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> having fun in it cuz there's like a kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in a candy store right like the same why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> we always go to these very expensive we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> always go to these stores and being it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was like filming there with permission </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> we you know we want to be here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> professionally we did we didn't Logan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pour this yeah God permission because we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> respect we respect yeah we got all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> pressure in stores and it's great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you can't just got to let loose </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in this store I mean some of us also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have people in there so I'll still try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be respectful but yeah you know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> anime we were there's no one else in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that spot we've got in like before the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> story yeah yeah when we left the store </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> there was like a massive queue of people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I I feel kind of bad right now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like crimes yeah look at these peasants </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh yeah like a lot of the stores were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like very happy to have us I mean like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> amiami made us like sign that way yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you ever go to army army in Akihabara </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> look out for a little plaque yeah we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have a trash tastes like plaque hang </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that up is like no but all of the stores </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> were super freaking cool they're very </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> very supportive so first of all be shout </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> outs all the stores that did give us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> permission to film there yeah but yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> without further ado I think we should go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> over what we bought in his store and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> judge our as the name suggests track </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> based on figurines let's just before we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> jump right in let's just hold off on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> jump okay I want to discuss so did you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> guys have any strategy going into this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> game or into this challenge even I said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I did in my main channel video but in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> retrospect I did if if I win it was all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> plans I was just having a fun choice you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> know I think that's okay if you go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hundred percent honest I like had some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> idea but I think it my strategy was just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> see what you guys are doing so yeah I so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trying to go off all the challenges and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I could see you guys have paying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> attention like okay I was gonna but if I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> knew that's because I could tell someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you won pain as much attention to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> challenges as others I'm sorry the only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> challenge that I paid in mind too was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> only one that I remembered which was the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whoever gets closest to $500 we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taking about two points yeah we just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> what two points I'm like I have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> prioritize that two points is big whose </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> voice is big but like I remember because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I couldn't even remember what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> challenges are we agreed on so I went to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into you the day being like okay this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one's an obvious challenge this one's an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> obvious challenge as I went into more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stores I was like I am not keeping track </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of money I don't know what's happening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when wells Wells when I was in animate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like okay I'm gonna do this in this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> store do this in that store and then I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hit the second store I'm like what the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] am i doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh I was so short decided on like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> challenges that I had to do in that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah to put it in perspective we got two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> challenges for every story produce on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the video we're so rich is a total of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> eight points that we could get there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ten eleven points up for grabs in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> overarching yes yes so I mean if you do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> really well on the overarching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> challenges it might not [ __ ] matter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah exactly like we're already </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> close yeah I'm eight seven six right now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I might be losing but like any good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mario party game I can always come back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> animate I didn't I didn't buy much in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this story I was the first why I'm gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pull the trigger okay so here's the I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't know how much I should boss </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> revealing right now or what do we do I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> mean who wants to go first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean okay oh can I kill the host again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll go first because I only bought one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> thing at a time okay so one of my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> challenges was to get a maid in abyss </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> figurine yeah couldn't find it not even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> not just an animate any of the storm but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I figured you know what I'll get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something like kind of cool and kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> niche so I got Chucky mother from door </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or oh yeah it's an Android of Chucky </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mother and I mean it was so [ __ ] yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> love me my physical Samus stuff and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> love da door and I was like you know I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like my name droids - really really cute </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean we will probably figure out the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> pose of it somehow but that's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> special thing about nan droids you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> have to you go to pick one pose and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's it's never good we all know it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> never good also see Nikki as well but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> once you've like nailed it you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Haley exactly yeah so that's the only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing I got cuz yeah I got a few things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have no um so it's I I had two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> challenges right and I think I got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] over over some of the overarching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> challenges by by just animates itself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really okay let's let's go ahead so the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first thing the first challenge was to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> buy a Deku figure from my hero academia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so yeah as we all know one of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> overarching challenges was the word the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> person who buys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> figure from the most popular series </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> getting deduct at a point yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's there's my deck I was actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> getting bit worried right because there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> weren't many like figures in really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> varied yes so the only thing I could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> find on Nendoroids and so my second </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> challenge was to ask a store clerk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> what is Japanese to recommend me what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> have you recommend you again he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> recommended to me one he recommends me </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> will spend 48 bucks yeah oh my so I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> looking at that one hi my two challenges </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> will get a female figure and get one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> from a show that you watched recently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I watched like a few episodes like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two months ago so yeah why didn't you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> get the nesco figure I saw your figure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like [ __ ] fight the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Normie award and I knew that do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> flares of the motion or whatever the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rankings say I've lost the Normie award </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> at heart </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and plus you know I want to risk it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all so I thought you know it's kind of a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cool figure yeah oh yeah yeah yeah it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if we have Nezzer KO it when she's what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like fake anime fans get the [ __ ] out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> man I think God has like fulfilled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> prophecy the Boomer of Annie trivia tell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me about why massacre is you know I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> gone like how many episodes and I've not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> talked about you Moto's yeah you you are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you're taking this chance to just give </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> us some time okay for the record I hate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> nan droids I think nan droids are like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stressful purchases and we have four </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goddamn mandroids </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cuz you have to post them right and and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the whole best selling point of an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Android I'm pretty never gonna be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sponsored by an Android over the whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> selling point of an Android is that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can move it but tell me everyone who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> owns an Android when have you changed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the pose of an Android I change it a few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> let's lie I've never changed yes he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lying I've changed it because I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sponsored by this mark thanks guys it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> stressful and then you got to worry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about the box and the little things I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just I sometimes like where I'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like I look at the little pop and I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like I want to change it eventually and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> then I do and I'm like okay I'm glad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay actually before we go on question </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to you guys what do you do with a figure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> box do you been out or just office I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> store </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] man I ripped that [ __ ] off the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> value the mentality for me is like if I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> eventually like possibly get like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> know I'm gonna sell this figure yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] off you know you gonna sell this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video that's me I'm like oh maybe I can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> sell this Jojo mark what helped me at my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> last place is that it makes moving house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so much easier yeah if you keep the boss </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sure because you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I usually what what I do at least with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> figurines right is like I throw out like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the plastic like mold yeah so much space </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but but the thing is if you chuck out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the plastic mold and you flatten the box </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay Dan yeah when you like move house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you can just open the box up again glad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm too lazy so much time and money and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like possibly like the risk of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> ruining a figure in mid move and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that save me so much trouble when I move </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to my current house so that's why I hold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> onto it all right okay yes I stayed for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> repurposing solid purchases though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> overall great the next my favorite anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Full Metal Alchemist I recommend you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> guys watch that favorite character from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but the next store we went to was a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> store that's so much okay okay what were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you what before we get to a stop what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was your guys's strategy with a stop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> okay a stop is probably the store that I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> go to the most just yes so I knew I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> really had to spend time just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> looking around yeah because there are so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> many figurines at a stop that I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> legitimately have never seen anywhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> else even though they're technically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> second-hand yeah yeah so I'm like okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna aim for those and I think I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> got a decent solution because for me a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> stop was the most daunting shop right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> good okay so in my challenge I had to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> squat ten times before get interested </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> smaller challenge that was easy and my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> second challenge wasn't also lose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I had to buy the most expensive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> figure which we found out was like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thousand bucks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Neal's gonna lose that so I was like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was going into a stop just not trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> complete any challenge we're just trying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to like buy figures that I like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah follow your heart </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so I kind of went [ __ ] mental </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> windows top I filled up my piece of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> paper no no no no okay serious yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> same it okay cuz I like with a stop </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> there are so many figures and so many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> display cases that's you don't remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> wet which ciggy which figure you saw </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> where yeah so my strategy was just if I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> see him if I see a figure I like I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna write it down right and maybe I'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> cross that later I [ __ ] myself over so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bad because I was just like I remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seeing you like halfway through and I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> had filled up my entire yeah yeah you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> hadn't even had you didn't even still </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> walking I was just going okay that one I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get right down right down right now and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then I got to the end and then I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> couldn't remember which [ __ ] I had that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> he was like is it this one I feel like I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> think I think yeah so who's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically trying to choose between my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> children's I'm like what the [ __ ] am i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> crossing out right now yeah no [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> clue Wow okay yeah because yeah like for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> me like a stop I knew if I wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> careful at a stop I was gonna absolutely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ham yeah as I usually do just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> casually so I'm like okay there's still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two stores left we're not even halfway </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> through this challenge so I have to like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> limit myself as much as possible a taste </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> this so I only bought three things oh oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> oh okay how many of you how many yet I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> can't remember like five six I mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'll see do you want to go first I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> decided to like kind of go for like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> smallish once so my two challenges was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the first one was really easy I had to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> go up to the store Clark and asked if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they had boku no pico much which they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> said they didn't thank god they know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well the guy was an English speaking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> stuff so he's like is that the one where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the two guys [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you'll see it in the video but uh the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> other challenge was really easy it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just pick a figurine that either myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gone okano likes so obviously I went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the one that I liked so that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] by the line filling glad Rob </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right here so I got a unwrap this ship </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but I obviously got my goddamn wife in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> monogastric of course it is oh of course </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it is look if I'm gonna be on this show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> casually like all the freaking time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] horse okay I need it to get my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> wife is she Nova I actually don't even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have this one at home </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I guess I'm gonna go I'm just gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go next now because of course I followed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my heart as well so yeah IIIi knew Joey </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> would get a Shinobu figure cuz I saw so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> many boxes that were just purely Shinobu </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like get that [ __ ] out of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me get that [ __ ] out of my face man you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> might need to like hold up to the camera </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it might have been assisted with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the boxes in the way actually yeah so I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean like what I tried to do at a stop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was at the beginning I just tried to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just tried to no down as many figures </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as I could for under 20 bucks because I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feel I feel like anything over anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> over 20 bucks was like kind of risking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> its in terms of I mean especially if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're playing like seven figures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly exactly so this one's I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have I don't have this figure yet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because this short hair Sanjay Kihara </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> oh that's cute that's dude I personally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> find this short hair central kawaras </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> figurine so much nicer than the long one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there was so many good center Gaara </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> figurines so it like hurts me that I had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to buy the cheapest one always I bought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> this is uh there was a nine hundred yen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sword online like the goods it was the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> cheapest sword online figure because you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know if you're gonna buy garbage why why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> care about which you know like terrible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> item it is it was 900 yen I think and it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was the cheapest sword online figure oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> damn okay was this for a challenge yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> remember I had to shout I freaking love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sao </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> while buying an SEO agency yeah I will </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> figuring yeah and the other one I got is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> also pretty cool it's puck from berserk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> how much was that this is 980 yen oh wow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> cuz every Buzzard figure I saw was so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> expense </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like there's there's a few figures in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the sword I found like Nana Chi the the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the little Nana Chi figure mana she was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like 250 bucks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh yeah know the meaning of this stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is so explored that made an abyss thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> at a stop I probably still wouldn't have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> been able to do it because I'm not gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> spend $250 I got I got URI from Angel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Beats she was I can't remember how much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was between ten and I there's one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> figure that I didn't get I of course </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> puts a guru down I have cause for salary </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> down and you see in my video when I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like trying to figure out which fit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is which and that was like just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> crossing our figures the realization </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I had crossed out Zachary was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like my heart </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] sank man my heart sank when I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> oh no I crossed us a girl how could I oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my god don't don't look at what I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> humbled I mean I mean that's this this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is essentially all I bought at a stop I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think I spent I didn't even spend $100 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> at a stop I think because yeah I spent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nine thousand nine hundred and forty and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at a stop because this shounen jump one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was 5,000 yen it's kind of expensive but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not too bad I mean I just try to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> syndra's is like Miriam Mirren's I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to say I bought the single best figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> [Music] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> $30.00 Mike Wazowski is so cool that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> actually like that's I know cuz I saw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Mike Wazowski I'm like ado shouting I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> was like Mike what are you doing here so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I have it was a $30.00 purchase and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just wanted to make you guys laugh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I I can see that that's good for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> actually why I love this dude I love how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like the base is the monsters in Claudia </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yes that's so cool I bought it for a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> troll but I actually thought it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> bad no that's actually I think our </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> audience can appreciate that that's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> cool do you have any more figures Connor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I have plenty hot key figures yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mean I'm all out so I'm just gonna watch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you guys you keep talking yeah Meg am in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> my life cool she was a cheap I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> she's like 19 bucks make me some mega </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mint agree it's a pretty big figure like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the form factor of this box it's pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> deceiving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's what do you notice about a mega </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mint figurines and some of them are like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> way cheaper than what they should be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's hard to tell the difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between an $80 mega man figure and a $20 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe like you know it's up with some of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the popular characters there's like so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> many different prices yeah yeah with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of the popular characters because I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think I was about to buy I was gonna buy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> darkness as well oh I thought Joey was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna buy Mega Man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thought about it but I'm like I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> need to and I reckon one of you guys is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna buy in so hold on hold on well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> ninety point each Oh Joe figures oh wow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's um it's funny you asked oh thank </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> god </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> thank God I would just like to preface </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that that was not a scripted cuz we were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just showing figures and I remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> thinking I I say in the video okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Connors gonna buy Joe Joe figures I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't need to buy it I don't need to buy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any Joe Joe figures yeah so if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't buy any I would have been like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> how did we go an entire [ __ ] trip to a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> key Harbor without buying any joke boy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> multiple Jared your fingers actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's all sides okay good good on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Brad so this is the figure that I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> actually never seen before this is the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> crazy diamond George a figure and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the one of the special colored editions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually I think is the there's a normal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> colored version and I've never seen this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figure before and I've never seen it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> listed anywhere or anything but there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two of them in the store funny enough I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hope somebody like 19 bucks for 19 bucks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a really nice figure and if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've seen Joe Joe figures you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they look ABS a charge a lot more for a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot less effort it's it's tragic that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like a 20-buck figure for the special </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> call edition is like way better than I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> paid a hundred 20 also like enjoyed your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> figures it's like a double-edged sword </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that like some of them just look like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> absolute ass some of them do not look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like the character tonight and it's kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of tragic it's like one of the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> influential and popular series in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and they do them dirty but it's a good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing we can agree on that that is a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beautiful figure my boy should I show my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> next figure that I bought I bought a lot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> of they stop for 10 this is war dude I </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_06> store I and I don't know if we got this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> on camera I don't think we did Joe he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like I was gonna buy this figure and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he pointed to the booth where I got this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> figure he was like oh I must spend in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the different booth and I was thinking I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> bought the moment like I looked over it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> was like a comic I was like I looked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> over and it was just gone my head I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just like someone bought it it is how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much that cost it was like 30 bucks 30 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> bucks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh cool that is for 30 but it is so it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is not standing up I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> realizing now okay good like do you see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cure figure no yeah never [ __ ] steal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> okay absolutely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's very cool oh now it's standing up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I guess now yeah this is my last </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figure I of course I wanted to fill this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> channel with some degeneracy just you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know what you just the question is how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> much was I willing to spend on it are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you kidding me yes really yeah yeah oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> my god do you want to know how much I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> spend figure I think I don't think I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> walked past and I think I remember it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> being way over my budget how much this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> was $170 when I saw it I was like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gotta get this cuz you know you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that mean when it's just like how to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> help me budget this correctly when I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going through the sheet I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> crossing off figures and Sydney was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just get rid of the [ __ ] highschool </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> DxD getting rid of the high school I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> walked past this figurine had my video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like I would get this okay if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it wasn't a hundred and seventy dollars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because I didn't want to go overboard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but the moment I saw and I'm like one of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> these ones that feel when I realize that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't have the most expensive figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah oh this is in two parts okay so I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> was trying to put that together under </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> underneath okay okay yeah what's what is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> this oh sure yeah figures okay is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> uh is this the dragon from slime it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> indeed yes my parts holy [ __ ] I didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> realize that we'd that fly line would be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> representing this much because honestly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like I didn't put too much thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> into what I was trying to buy there we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go this came with so many oh I'm so glad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm so glad you got a reamer ooh so wow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that's so cool yeah wait till we build </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it but like this was a two-in-one figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if that counts as me buying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two figures or if it's I paid one but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's true I mean that's technically one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no no cuz they're not actually joined </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah they were sold to get oh my god </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so guess how much I paid for these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> two yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 20 bucks I pay 30 bucks for the both of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> them okay because I originally said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> originally had a Merriam figure and a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Rimmer figure which is 35 bucks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no no it was like it was like a bundle I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dragon no no she's real nice oh no KOCO </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with Miriam and then I decided to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> against that just to go from a rim so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm glad that we don't have a single </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like character that's like overlap yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I'm surprised cuz I thought I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> thought at this point we would at least </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> have like some dupes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or characters but we've miraculously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> somehow come over help add where's his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> head not going in what [ __ ] this wing is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not going in either but yeah I sold me a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> faulty thing I'm jerking those variants </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so is that everything you ball Connor my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> finger gone I spent money on that but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I thought you know I knew I knew </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> falling apart </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I knew one of you were gonna get a slime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> figure yeah so I thought you know I'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> get it cuz I thought also it's super </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> blue yeah I thought that would look sick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> on the podcast so like how much did you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> spend on we'll find out later because I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> store where I spend the most I thought I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> thought because when I finished uh when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I finished go through the store I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> thought that I had at least bought the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most figures in this door because I saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Joey's horn and I was like I got this I </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> I felt like I was too behind it had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> animate yeah so I went ham in a stop and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> then uh this is when I was like okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe I should start like being careful </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was the complete opposite at this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> point I had more than half of my budget </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> left </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh my so I was gonna go like big big </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> bucks boy on K books and the final army </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> army what would you buy I got two okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> one of my challenges was to get in a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stall for figurine right I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> why super specific but I found one a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> stole faux figurine didn't even come it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because what happened right who was to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those two you didn't find because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because we were walking past there and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was I saw the Estelle full figure yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just I was just like putting loads </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of other figures on corner come look at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> this I got this and I didn't I didn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> see the second one so there was another </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> one so I like waited ahead and I watched </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> him as he was going through it and he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> actually found another one but the one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that you buried he didn't find ya oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> damn it the kiss he always got me with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that conspiracy but then the second one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I got oh the second challenge was to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> find a car kept a soccer figurine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unfortunately I couldn't find one but I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know that if I went to K books like six </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> months ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't like soccer I did the new </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> soccer was still like hot and fresh in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone's minds I don't know what it </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> hundred and thirty two dolls oh okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with an interchangeable head book every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> episode we're changing the head I'd say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that I'll have to do it but that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty much the only two things I bought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah cuz at this point I was just trying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to stay alive they stopped it stopped </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> really fun with you spend how much are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they stop and then you also spend a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> ton of anime yeah yes so I had I think I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> budgeted it it's like I think I could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> only spend around 70 bucks or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> or maybe less in each store so I had to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> complete the challenges which was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> getting a figure from a shown in Syria </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh my god I mean I already knew I'd lost </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this point so I didn't really but what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> surprised me because I I wasn't really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> familiar with K books so I didn't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what kind of merchandise they had yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they did not they did not have a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> shown in figure no that's all right it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was between this one and a leafy one and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just went for the cheapest one because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I needed what I challenged I wanted to </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> Dajjal cake on that we went to but </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> missed the entire figure section right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the back Sarge necks yeah yeah we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were just walking around and there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one figure I found which was $200 no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually no way that I could buy that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> figure yeah and the I found another </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> figure which was fifty bucks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I've no no fifty to seventy bucks but I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that was the tiny bill budget this this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this girl [ __ ] me so hey I mean she's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a succubus that's luckily I found an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> oscar pop figure because it was the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> cheapest okay I think this is gonna be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> awarded for the most Normie no offense </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you like pop vinyls but we know no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> offense if you do like let's look at hey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> pop figures oh Jesus how much you spent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> on this 14 bucks you know what it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's like you go to like hey you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come to Japan right you have all these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> amazing figures yeah it's like go into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like a like Germany and being like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want hot dogs from the can please I want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I want not none that starts like gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Germany me like can have an Asahi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> No yeah I'll give you for the challenge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it was for the challenge instead </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like like this army ami had a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> good figures yeah I really really wanted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to buy I just needed to go for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cheapest okay and then the second one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I had no idea how to complete was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> by a furry and like 100% non humanoid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> figure and I was like okay the only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing I could [ __ ] think of was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> chopper from one piece yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> did not have any chopping oh my gosh I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> was like I've probably lost this and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then I was like mmm wait a minute that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> there's probably there's probably one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> thing I could I could twist and that's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> heavy figure okay okay I was like okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> if I can't go the chopper route maybe I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can go the Pokemon routes because I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> guess that's how they translating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese they realize that there's a way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> cuz when you pulled that out yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> thought you were gonna get one of these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah cuz I didn't think those kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of does a figure I thought but I'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> V's furry it's nonhumanoid it's a figure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shut the [ __ ] up I am getting that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> points okay okay okay that's back count </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tell us that counts because there was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> between like Eevee and Mewtwo I think I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like yeah he's cuter so yeah what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> are the challenges that you had Connor I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had by three anime mugs or glasses ass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they've other sets or anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's buy them separately yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it was also by a figure that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you think is trash so we're how much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> budget that you have left at this point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 140 something also you Alan set out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty wall between the four stores yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because I BAC spent nothing at anime I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> spent 70 bucks a K books so I kinda like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did pretty good at budgeting by accident </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I didn't plan anything I think not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> having challenges that [ __ ] me over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was yeah yeah yeah that was definitely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hopeful yeah shitty summary oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> no it was like 220 yen as well which my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> sheepish figure is is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Ida who the [ __ ] is the center your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> character does anyone know I think I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> know what you know I know like the what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that's cool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> okay I know time I'll go warm the egg </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> one oh good I liked it yeah yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't see Hello Kitty but I bought from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sure that was a hundred yen luckily Wow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every other mug was like a thousand yen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like nice to find two for 600 yen so we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> have more mugs now for the podcast right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get all drink from those possibly maybe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know these are like there's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> mark so I did the challenge is cool and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> then I had and I was like so annoyed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because the is a frothy figure the one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with like the cool comic book text I saw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one I saw that well I had just enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> budget to get that if it wasn't for this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I had to completely change my mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not saying the stuff is bad but it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> ruined my plan yeah so I had to go with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different I mean I guess you get what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you pay for right that's all that's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like there's 100 yen for a reason you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> know what what series is this I have no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> idea oh no it's all characters on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back and then these are from oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> play any or tell my games I know that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> huge here in Japan but I mean for a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> female demographic yeah I was just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> prefer yaoi just straight up yeah don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like you had come out with a yaoi like </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_06> you guys can fully appreciate me to go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but yes is that that was a hundred and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thirty seven thirty honestly worth every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> penny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> okay so while they were opening these </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> really sadistic Japanese way we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basically gonna be consuming something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we personally don't don't really </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> instinct right I wasn't trying to win </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the game I didn't have any [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] aren't even and this is what is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that what is that I just guess I'm a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> door knob I think of something it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> an arm in let me let me open this a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> towel of some some some money Tony it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> was a hundred yen towel what is this </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> cute girls like work out yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so bad I love it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I got some scroll from some show wow you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really like that why did someone have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like a challenger yet to buy wall squall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was from a different Oh trading cards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for 210 yen what is this what is this oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> wait you can put something in here well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> hopefully it for like tickets maybe some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like that train tickets </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe concert tickets its man you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you don't know if you want like to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> know who is it weird movie you just put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this on like a track everything I bought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it came out through an even 500 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly oh are you serious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hang on 500 [ __ ] I did the exact I had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this footage this in my video which you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guys didn't see I went to the cashier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I went 10 yen over so I asked the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guy I'm like no no take all the stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out I'm going back and they were all so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> confused they're like what's he trying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to say I'm like you kick up rid of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff I gotta go back so I went and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> found exactly what it was good the maths </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the spot went through my camera </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> footage to find out what I spend at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> least roll oh my do exactly 500 bucks I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was like I don't think there's anyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that's gonna get close to $500 like at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all like if I can get as close as I can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to 500 then I think I probably won so I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> think my overall price came to 49 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> thousand eight hundred and forty so I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> was 160 yen off because for me I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like after a stop I had just stopped </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> calculate I was not even uh I I died </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like I was like I'm probably gonna go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> bust probably gonna go bust and lose the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> entire thing but no I - came out to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> 47,000 150 - yeah which is like four </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> hundred seventy dollars that's how we do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's how we we should probably explain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that we are calculating it by dollars by </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just dividing by a hundred yeah so I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guess for the first challenge of whoever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> can get closest to $500 those two points </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are gonna go to call hell yes that means </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm the holy [ __ ] there's 10 points damn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was so confident that I was like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> thought like all both of you were gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> get like yeah I'm like not a hundred </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> sixty wait I got this yeah Jerry seems </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so confident when we were filming that I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the exact same things I got like exactly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Lucas cuz this [ __ ] he was like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> thought he'd planned everything right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> name same I talked to him off screen he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> turned up smiling and everything yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's like I got my strategy for each </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> door I'm like I'm no I did not like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> good game of poker you're gonna be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> overcome whatever you bluffed me into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> being exact with my money I wouldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have done that if I didn't know that you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> might have been a guy I didn't think you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were gonna like pile this small [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> forget exact I wanted to get those two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> points age what I don't want to eat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] I can't well then that was huge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so let's go over the next couple of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> challenges I think there's ten left yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> so the second one is the most expensive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> figure obviously that goes on and this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> done that was one hundred and sixty uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> hundred hundred and sixty thousand yen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 767 170 box by one and then mine was 137 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so Gong gets the point for that one yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah next one is the cheapest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> figurine I got the 220 yen figure yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> anyone did anyone beat that no mine was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> puck which is 900 Nader Oh mine was I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> think I can't even [ __ ] remember it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was a thousand bucks so even if I didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> buy that I still had the even gallier no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you still would have won even if I sir </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> okay the most the lowest rated series on </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> the point because mine wasn't berserk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is five thousand six hundred and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eighty no whoa no oh because it's the </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> you go attack on Titan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whatnot is that higher than attack on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Titan is number two I think if I look </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what I lost </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> number one is death no that's no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> definite okay I'm definitely say most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> minds according to according to my enemy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> list it's death note shingeki no kyojin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sort online then full metal alchemist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> lose that one cuz cuz I could because I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> saw my boy Levi where is he was it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> beautiful here like I couldn't oh I lose </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a point so okay final one buying a hint </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I figure okay okay okay so I'm at zero </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> points for me baby I'm gonna argue no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> no no no here's why I didn't I didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> realize this but you can replace </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Reese's tits to be uncensored are you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> serious yeah yeah yeah I didn't know I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't know what that was until I opened </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it up those are just nipples </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't know they came with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> interchangeable nipples we're gonna find </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that out after the yeah so light thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they're attached to the hand yeah oh my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> god I mean I would like to argue that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you buying the dakimakura already counts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> as like a thigh thing but that wasn't a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> figure but III think that uncensored </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nipples counts as a hentai figure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because we condone but but is it though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cuz it's highschool DxD it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> technically hand tie I mean if there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tits out there is it a hentai figure I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> mean I would like to argue that if it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> something we can't show yes Paul if it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something we can't show on this podcast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I have okay this isn't a hint I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so [ __ ] good only a single figure in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> clutch oh my god okay and the total </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> scores were Connor with 12 points got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with 12 points and I got 7 points why I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> would have won this if I didn't buy the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> attack on tiny figures by the way I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> woulda won this if I was actually smart </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> probably would have lost this if I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> didn't buy this one it was also your </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> downfall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah well it also more positives than </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> negatives because when we were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going through all the challenges because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we had complete forgotten the overall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> challenges and I was like wait a minute </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I think this one figure could be a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of these challenges yeah I'm like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> totally forgot we put hentai figure in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there would have bought a shitty one if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like it would have been hard good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's not any hentai figures no no cuz </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> all of the hentai figures were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> hundreds of dollars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah they mean you know it's a very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> cultured I'm I just like to point out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that I over all of these like overall </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> challenges I only know one point and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that was the fact that puck is the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> lowest rated out of everything here I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think the thing is that he went all out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with that yeah I was a bit more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> conservative spread my money out you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know you went like mid range </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hey I'm buying kind of expensive but no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is like I like this [ __ ] I'll just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> buy it this is what happens when you try </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to strategize I will at least like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> credit of probably getting the coolest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> no no you use cool that's cool you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> have that point yeah I'll have that put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up that face I'm not gonna win the pity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> points cookie this is such a nice figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> alright well since I lost I guess I have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> to eat a horrible thing I think I'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> produce a Maylene brought something yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> which I am NOT looking forward to eating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well that already I that I I can't even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> smell it but I can picture one of his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mouths like thank you may lean our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> amazing producer yeah alright well my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> challenge has arrived </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> hey it's ty so what what is this it's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> pickled mudfish so apparently according </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to our producer this smells awful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> apparently is just as bad if not worse </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> than surstroemming which is like pickled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it's like mackerel filling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like Swedish thing that old </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> youtubers eat okay so I'm gonna open up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and give it a smell of a jury </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I'm just gonna like I just saw that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> man go to heaven smells like actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> light well it I can smell it from here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on smell it like oh this looks okay I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> mean we have no utensils gonna have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> get in that I think I'm I think I've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> eaten that oh my god </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's like okay so it's like Verdi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> salted fish right so it's gonna be super </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> super super salty I'm just gonna grab </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like a piece of it weights to show it on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> camera [ __ ] show that piece on camera </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah careful the boghei is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that off yeah yeah just don't get on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> microphone like Inez please gravity how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is it yes it's just salted fish right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some water because what what kills you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is the [ __ ] artist the first few </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bites aren't that bad but the more you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> chew it the more like the flavors come </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out under the aftertaste just just it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> hits you and your breath is gonna stink </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for like a [ __ ] oh my god it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] stinks now hey guys should you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> should wash it down with the durian </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> anything that would be a good I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that'd be a good idea </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> seeing as you did lose pretty badly yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> don't smell it maybe a jury I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think like I've eaten a lot of weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> foods in my life this is easily the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> grossest thing I've ever had yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> smell it over there it's like a fire I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> think the smells getting stronger yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> fallout zone here it's like it's like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> nuclear blast I'm like fine if I hold my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nose because like I don't like smell the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing but the moment I get rid smell my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> own breath it's next week when we do the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> podcast Joe will still be smelling it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I really just hope this doesn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> give me like an illness because we're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like going on a trip to old tide people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we're going on a vacation tomorrow yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't want to be sick it's gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] stink it's in the windows of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> infectious episode like Jesus so so now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that the challenge is over what are you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> guys as closing thoughts I'm in each </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> little [ __ ] I mean you know the goal the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> ultimate goal was was the one not lose </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and become like this mani yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going through like the five stages of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> grief with his face you know we got to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> decorate the office I think by a miracle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> we got like some pretty good variation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh yeah honestly would love to do some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like this again in future with another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> challenge we're not going film I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> surprised that out of all the things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we bought not a single person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bought the same thing yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because that was the thing I was most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> worried about right when I you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pitched the challenge I was the thing I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was worried I was like what if we all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just go for the same [ __ ] figure Zaku </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> dendekker </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would like three of your finest deck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because because yeah I had a lot of fun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> filming in the stores and I would love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to do something like this again I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know if you guys enjoyed seeing the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> aftermath of all our different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> individual challenges and how we like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> approached it yeah I mean I think it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the speak for all thing we have fun with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> every step of this process I really hope </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that was reflect I got to ask you though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah cuz this is your first time doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a video filming in public okay I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> used to embarrassing myself and how was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it I got to know it was hard like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> outside of animate when I was filming my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> intro I don't even know if you're gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> see that because I'm thinking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> filming like a separate intro anyway so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was just like tripping over my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> words I had no idea yeah give me a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> script great I can read off the script </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I just have to talk about my thoughts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> without any scripts and like a podcast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is different in my mind's cuz I have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> people to bounce off right because when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm looking at a camera I'm like hey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> guys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm here outside of an anime oh my gosh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like somewhat tribal speaking skill you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> learn I think yeah and I mean I always </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> awkward as [ __ ] I remember first but I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think I got used to it when I just it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was a stop animates I was so like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> getting my feet on the ground with a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stop I was just I think it was thanks to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just the facts the places well because I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't great I wasn't thinking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what challenges there were yeah I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just thinking about getting as many </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] fingers like I did a lot of fun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was well I was like a great </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> environment like when you get permission </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to film in a place and cuz the original </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> plan for this video was just to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> MacGyver away through GoPro cover that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> would have not been that great yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but I mean I haven't edited the video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yet but I think it's gonna be pretty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty entertaining and you guys can let </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> us know as well like how you guys found </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> those videos how you found this episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hopefully you guys enjoyed watching me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eat literal [ __ ] this is easily the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> worst [ __ ] thing I've ever had I can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> still [ __ ] taste it I really want you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guys to smell your fingers I mean I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely even though this was like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> logistical nightmare planning that's me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about logistics from episode oh yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> this was like actual logistical </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nightmare planning all this yeah we had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like bounce stores and it's short </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> notice and everything like I would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely be up for doing something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's like three angles again and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a challenge that we have concluded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> on the problem it's like you you like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not sure if you see in the video but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by the time we got to army army </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I was I was exhausted like it was it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of like that feeling when you've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> just spent an entire day at a con </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> working oh yeah yeah I've got to do one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> more just a con in general yeah yeah I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] oh we gotta have dinner oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> asleep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like I remember post filming I just went </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> home and collapse yeah yeah I didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> leave my bed yeah I think we won't look </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> 10 kilometers that day yeah I checked my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like stat typical Tokyo Dave Church you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do a lot of walking when you come to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Japan yeah but I think so what was the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> favorite thing you guys bought them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a good question </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> easy play for you yeah instinctively I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> want to say like I mean I think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good it's sorted but I think the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> interesting for you and like coolest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ones I'm glad I bought was maybe the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> akhira one which i thought was just so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> far or the leave I want Mike Wazowski </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> though the name should be sad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> kendo yeah that's that's a good deal I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> think my favorite is definitely John oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's because it's so unique I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> love unique figures yeah yeah there's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> many figures that look alike and who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't like job exactly yeah I just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that's gonna that it's just gonna look </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> good yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what is okay what's the worst figure you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> think each of us bought this is this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing what the hell I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> actually I liked all the figurines I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> bought maybe that's why I what's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> most biggie thing I bought was one you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bought or I mean you bought so many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> icons </SPEAKER_05>
