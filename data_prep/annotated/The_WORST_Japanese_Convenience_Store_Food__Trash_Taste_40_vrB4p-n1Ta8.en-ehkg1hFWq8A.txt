<SPEAKER_05> (chewing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Chewy bread doesn't taste
good with the chocolate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that they put in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll fuck with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Joey you fuck with anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Joey's like, is that fucking weird? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll fuck with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is this seasoned vomit? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I'ma try it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (groovy music) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's up you crazy konbini cunts? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Welcome to another episode.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That wasn't my idea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> That was Garnt's. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know you've been hanging
out with Aki too much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause that was the most
American sounding cunt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I've ever heard.
- Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah that was like the hard C, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That is like actually the most
offensive thing you can say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to an Australian. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - POV you're a YouTube channel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> waving goodbye to monetization. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So what are we doing today Joey? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What's the theme of today's episode? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well the theme of today's episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is Japanese convenience stores. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't just say konbini in the intro </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for shits and giggles. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like we're going to be talking konbinis </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> as it's called in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Because Japan I feel is
the only country where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the word convenience in
the word convenience store </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually, you know, means what it means. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think there's a lot
of places in Asia where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> convenience stores are very convenient </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but definitely as someone
who's traveled around, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan's up there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just built different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Japan's up there, some of
the best convenience stores </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in the world. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And you've seen all those videos, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's YouTube is with
the, you know, Kevin MacLeod </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or whatever the fuck he's called. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Copyright free music playing
in the background being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> these are my favorite 10 konbini snacks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's not what we're doing today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're going to crack open-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The konbini halls? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the konbini. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're just going to crack
open a bunch of beers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> just start eating shit
and just saying words. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's how we do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Part of this is we want
to represent our team </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because I am team 7-11. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He is team Lawson. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and he is team Family Mart.
- I'm team Family Mart. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just think Lawson's
is built different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They've just figured it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like Family Mart? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay honestly like, 7-11
I respect the choice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Family Mart? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're actually just
like, you have zero taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Family Mart is the clown pick right here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> 7-11, we are a global conglomerate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> We have not just taken over Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We are fricking everywhere in Asia. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm gonna prove-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that's why they've been tainted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by all the other countries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm going to prove why
today 7-11 is the biggest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> convenience store.
- Mind you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there's more than these three
convenience stores in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> There's like the smaller ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like Mini Stop, Daily Yamazaki. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I fuck with Daily Yamazaki. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Everyone I know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think I asked Chris, I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do you like Daily Yamazaki? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And Chris was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> no that's fucking awful.
- Chris is the whitest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> man alive, what does he know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - He's like me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why I can trust his opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's like finally, another white man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Chris, I need another
white British man opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Is this good? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> No it's shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> All right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, whenever I go to like Daily Yamazaki </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or one of the smaller chains </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like going to
fucking Audi's or Iceland </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> in the UK.
- You never see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> these convenience stores. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Now, if you don't know anything
about convenience stores </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they are pretty much
found every 100 meters. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Literally every block of land </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's at least one konbini, I find. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Literally, when you like
look into houses to rent, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one of the selling points is literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the meters away from the
nearest convenience store. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When you're looking at listing for houses. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's how much they
care about convenience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - If you live in Tokyo,
there'll most 100% be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like three within your vicinity. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Absolutely, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And even when you go rural areas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you're driving around,
there'll be nothing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And then out of the distance--
- Suddenly there's a konbini. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You'll just see this perfect
immaculate 7-11 just there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's great because
it's not like a gas station </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where you're like, fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> God, I gotta go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's hot dogs that are
probably gonna give me salmonella. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm probably not gonna like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's legit good food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> So we picked a bunch of items today </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we all kind of liked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Or that we could find. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause sometimes the item's not available. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - We pick the items that we normally buy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when we go to our
convenience store of choice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And then we got our intern
to buy a lot of other random </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> shit from convenience
stores, just to show to you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what--
- Go out of our comfort zone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a little bit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, going out of our comfort zone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> just to show you what is available </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at Japanese konbinis. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah we definitely haven't tried </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> all the things we're
going to talk about today. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's kind of a learning experience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Also, if you're an audio only listener </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is just going to be eating ASMR. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You should probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> tune into YouTube.
- Highly recommend. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> This is going to be the
closest to the figure episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that we've released in a while </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where if you're an audio
only listener, I apologize. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Shall we just kind of jump
right into it, gentlemen? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now I think I know
what I want to start off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because this is the debate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I think started this episode idea, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is fried chicken. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now, I don't care about how good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the rest of the konbini food is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How I judge konbinis is the fried chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because when I moved to Japan, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we think that a lot of
Americans, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they would like to stan
their fried chicken, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but a lot of the best fried chicken I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> had has come from Asia. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And konbini fried chicken
is way too fucking good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It should be illegal to make
fried chicken taste this good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like restaurant
quality fried chicken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - So when you go to the konbini </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there'll be hot food sections, right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Where you can get various
amounts of hot food, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the fried chicken is
like the selling point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They'll often have a whole section. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like probably the
first thing you'll see. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it normally comes in as, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as the gentleman will show you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It comes in this little
pouch like this, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, it doesn't come in the pouch, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's on display on like a heating rack. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But they put it in a pouch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then they put it in a pouch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And what you can do is you
just rip off half the pouch, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Unless you're Lawson and you
have to open it from the top </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a madman.
- I don't mind that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't mind squeezing it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> This is the Lawson fried, look
at that, look at that man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is that not?
- Family. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Look. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Convenience store points down, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Because look how convenient it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Look at the convenience of this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look at that, look at that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where's the fucking seasoning on that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's nothing on there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd like to just give a huge disclaimer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm personally not a huge fan of this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I'm like one in a million where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I almost never buy the fried
chicken at convenience stores. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Why? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cause I don't really like
fried chicken to begin with. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Now this is the standard, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just pepper and salt fried chicken. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But at Lawson's you can get like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a ton of different variations. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They have one that is like, it's like a, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like a Chinese sweet and sour one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like black. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I don't know why it
doesn't look good at all, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That just, I've never tried it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but it just looks--
- Chinese sweet and sour, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know, I know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause it's a literal black chicken, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it looks like someone, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like someone took a chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just dunked it in squid oil. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what it looks like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What I think we should do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is we should cut up three pieces. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We should trade pieces. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We should trade piece. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My hands are greasy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Can we get like napkins galore by the way? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. I'm going to, I'm
going to take the knife </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and then I'm going to cut up three pieces. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do mine as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Now here's the thing,
these chicken right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're not going to
look at peak condition </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because we had to microwave these. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Normally they're crispy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're nice and crispy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They come in piping hot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fresh out the oven. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I just cut two pieces. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So you guys can take and
I'll just take this half. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fantastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fan fucking tastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - There we go, there's
two pieces for you boys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And also if you're not really
into like a whole breast, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's fine, 'cause a lot
of them also have like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the like, nuggets, like substitute. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Thank you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right here you go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'ma hand these over to you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, let's give it a shot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Alright, let's-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is like the last supper,
but Family Mart edition. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're not sharing the bread. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> We're sharing the chicken. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Joey if you will do me the honor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Grab one of these. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Grab one of these. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll try it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Should we try the Family
Mart chicken first? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Let's go bottom up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Let's start with Family Mart. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what, the
crispiness looks good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The color looks good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm down for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was very wet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Look at the grease
that's left on my plate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - There is a lot of grease in there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Out of all of these, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of all of these, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> The Family Mart one has
almost left a puddle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just actually like,
kinda, I'm gonna eat it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, like, look. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You can tell this is Family Mart chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's like compared
to the Seven chicken, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this one ain't, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This one can't be white. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's gonna stain the white one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just going to go straight through. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's gonna go straight through. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I'm gonna... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is very fatty and very greasy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like there's no breast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is, ugh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Obviously, if you know,
I'm in the middle of nowhere, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm in Hokkaido. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I want a beer and a fried chicken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's going to do the job. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But when there's Lawson's
and you know, 7-11. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Again, I will happily take this L </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> because I don't even eat
fried chicken to begin with. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> My problem with Family
Mart fried chicken is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it tastes like death. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, sometimes when
you're eating and you realized, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wait a minute, I'm eating
a dead animal right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> That is what Family Mart
chicken tastes like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It feels like they inject
it with stuff as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like that too, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's try the 7-11 one now, shall we? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shit, which one's the 7-11 one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It'll be this one, this color. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The slightly orange one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's pretty good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The reason I stan 7-11 and the
reason it's my favorite one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is because of their fried chicken. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This one's also quite fatty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's fatty enough where it's less </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than the Family Mart chicken. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the perfect amount. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know when you... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know when you want a
beer and you just want to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eat something unhealthy? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is the perfect amount
of oil and unhealthiness </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that doesn't make you feel
like you're eating death. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It still makes you feel
like you're eating, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like something that you
shouldn't be enjoying every day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a bit of a... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have to say, I think
in terms of the seasoning? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - They seasoned the fuck out of that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's way better than the Family Mart. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think out of all of them, this, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> with Lawson's they have way more choice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the chicken seasoning. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like there's like the spicy seasoning. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I do this this is
gonna be the weakest one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out of the choices that Lawson's have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not trying to like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> put myself in a corner, but
like, yeah, I'm just saying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like out of everything, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 7-11 does just, just does the
basic fried chicken the best. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Has the best seasoning.
- I'll agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Doesn't need anything
fancy, no spicy chicken. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just pure, here's what
fried chicken should taste like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> salt and pepper, seasoned perfectly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the right amount of oil. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It is the best fried chicken. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay let's try this Lawson one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I've realized immediately that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of the thickness of chicken, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is probably the thickest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The thick one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You're getting good chicken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like a proper amount of chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is a proper amount of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here's the chicken, and here's the... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That could be a tendie
dude, that's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It honestly tastes
like a tendie as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just the right amount of juicy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually you know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I think that might be my favorite. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It tastes more like a chicken
tender than like a breast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It tastes like, the closest
to KFC for some reason. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean?
- I agree, I agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it needs more seasoning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. This is what I mean,
like take that chicken, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And then actually put like a
fuckton of seasoning on it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Make it spicy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> That's the best. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because that's the reason
I stan the 7-11 chicken. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It is, like I'd say there's less fat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than the 7-11 chicken. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But the 7-11 chicken just
has the best seasoning. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And why do we eat fried chicken? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's because of the seasoning. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 11 secret herbs and spices. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like imagine buying KFC chicken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then all the skin's off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No one would want to eat
that shit, let's be honest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You eat it because of the skin, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because of the seasoning
on the fried chicken. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I will go, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I will fight you on this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So let's rate one two three. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I personally would say
Lawson, 7-11, Family Mart. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'd say the same for me personally. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm biased obviously, it's mine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'd say-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean you two are a little more biased. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd say 7-11, Lawson's, Family
Mart right at the bottom. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We can all agree that Family Mart's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> at the bottom in this case. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - As the third opinion in the room, Joey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I suppose you've put it
over the edge for Lawson's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would have to give a point to Lawson. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] I will say though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The seasoning for 7-11 is good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But I think it's like too
much seasoning for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They also do nuggets. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Now these are the basic kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> which you'd never catch me finding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just, I don't really care for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I want spice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's like, there's a hot version. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think there's a cheese version. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't fuck with the cheese versions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's like injected cheese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't trust that,
cheese should be on top. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It should never be injected. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's some things
that should be injected. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Cheese isn't one of them.
- Cheese ain't one of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Vaccines, check. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Medicine? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Medicine, check. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And these have been microwaved, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause we've heated them up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, they don't look
too great not gonna lie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you guys want to try a nugget? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The color on this chicken
is kind of tragic looking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna say. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I did eat one before
recording 'cause I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> getting really hungry.
- This looks actually, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is the most depressing chicken nugget </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I've ever seen.
- You know what this looks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like, this looks like,
this is like frozen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah look how yellow this is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was once frozen
and I just defrosted it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, it lacks any kind of color </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that makes it look, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that would make it look appealing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not any good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> They had a slam dunk. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Lawson's, 7-11, Family Mart, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and then whatever the fuck I just ate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, that was worse than
the Family Mart chicken. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I said the Family Mart
chicken tastes like death. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - That tastes right out the freezer. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what this tastes like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This tastes like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you show it, put it like, stab it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and share it to the camera? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Look at that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - This for real tastes like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - The skin is like dying to get off it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is like one of
those karaages you order </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at a really, really cheap izakaya. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like 50 yen fried chicken. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 50 yen for one, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That ain't it, chief. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Man. The fried, but I mean, honestly, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can't really go wrong
unless you go Family Mart. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I would say the
reason that, I mean we, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so where we live right now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we live right next to a Family Mart </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and we live right next to a Lawson's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Unfortunately we don't
live next to a 7-11. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's a shame for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause some of my best food
items, like the fried chicken, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like some of the other things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm going to show off today is from 7-11. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why like every
time you see a 7-11 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like an event or it's like (gasps). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Definitely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a random encounter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, yo, I can get
a friend chicken right now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll be right back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just had lunch but
finna grab a fried chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> real quick.
- Be right back boys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - They also have a bunch
of, it's not just these. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They have tons of other hot food items. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They have like, it's like a
pita bread with like fillings </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like folded up and then they microwave it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is that what you have?
- Well, and the other one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that I have right here,
well, no, the one I have here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is like a kushi. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like skewered meats. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, I have that as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So these are like the snack ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> They have like, pseudo-meat.
- Again, I don't think I've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> ever ordered these before,
but it looked like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That just looks like a yakiniku. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have never ordered. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is yakitori. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also yeah, yakitori.
- Yeah, yakitori. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've never ordered this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've never ordered this either. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Should we get some of that off? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't have a yakitori. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You don't? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Well you can try some of mine on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, these don't look like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you look at, you look at these on camera </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and they don't look any
different from each other at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't tell which one, the Lawson's... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Can I grab one of those? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yakitori is, and I can't tell which one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the Family Mart yakitori. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never gotten the yakitori. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is like skewered, like
barbecued skewered meats. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just feels like I'm playing with fire. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because these, both of these, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the color of them.
- They look awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The coloring, just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there is no coloring at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't go to like any
kind of convenience store </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get yakitori, there's plenty of amazing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yakitori restaurants all over Tokyo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's so cheap as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Normally you can buy per skewer. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, you know, some
of the cheaper places </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are like 30 yen a skewer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll try the Family Mart one first. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. Let's try the Family Mart. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's awful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That's so bad.
- That is bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That is bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think this has to be fresh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because we microwave these. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This, what this tastes like is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they didn't know how to flavor this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So they just put as much
salt on this as possible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah this is salted like fucking crazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is salt and oil. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What I'm tasting right now
is just very salty oil. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just stabbed into the Lawson </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it like squirted oil. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Straight up squirted oil. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Alright, let me try the... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's try the Lawson one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let me try the Lawson's one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They're just both as bad as each other. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they're not that good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah that's pretty fucking bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bottom line, don't go
to a convenience store </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get yakitori. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Lots of amazing izakayas and
restaurants to go to for that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You alright Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm trying to, I'm trying to
chew this and swallow this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I felt like we need a drink to go along </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with this amazing food. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ashley, get us a drink! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] Yes sir. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have we talked about Ashley
before on this podcast? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - We talked about him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> on the live stream.
- On the livestream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that we did, but yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We now have a intern. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> We hired our new intern Ashley. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What he did was he sent a full CV to us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What did you get Ashley? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> No! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> No Ashley! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What, why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you actually have a
beer so I can wash this down? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - At least he did us a
favor and got the mini ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you wanna explain what this is Joey? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, so this is Ozeki's one cup sake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is essentially the like
trailer trash level of sake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you can get at convenience stores. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Imagine Budweiser </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> trying to make a cheap
version of Budweiser. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And this is what you would get. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the Blue
Lightning of sake, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So how much does one of these cost? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> These cost like a dollar a pop, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like 100 yen, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] 250. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, it's 250 yen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's too much for this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So this costs about $2. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's literally a jar of sake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And we all know how much I love sake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - From the episode with Chris. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - None of us have tried this, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've never tried </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> this before.
- I've never tried </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm not even a big fan of sake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the first place.
- I like sake, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's--
- Well actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like wine, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I need the right food for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this is not the right food for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - If you calculate the
price per milliliter. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is actually more expensive </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> than the one Chris brought us, so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Could that actually? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If it's 250 yen, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, probably. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So Chris you fucking cheap mother. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm joking, I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well it doesn't smell horrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's sake, it never
smells of anything much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It doesn't smell too bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it smells like sake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What does bad sake smell like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - A bad sake will smell sour. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you'll know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, why, that's like
having milk and being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this smells sour. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Legit, like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you wanna give me this shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do you wanna throw it away? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Legit, like I've had bad
sake before and it's sour. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like sour milk, but
like, sake, it's horrible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> All right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Well I guess we got to try this huh? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So should we all do it at the same time? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cheers.
- Cheers, gentlemen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To a successful podcast, I hope. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - All right, let's give
it a shot shall we? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's actually not bad.
- That's not bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not bad at all actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I was expecting a burn,
or a bad after taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That's not bad.
- You know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't believe I'm saying this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm kind of fucking with this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it actually tastes all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You want mine? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> You want mine? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't fuck with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This man just cannot drink sake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is actually, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was expecting it to feel
like I'm drinking petrol. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what I was expecting as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Damn, Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is the cheap alternative </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to like getting pissed in Japan? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can see why all these, like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like old people go into,
you know, 7-11 or wherever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> buy one of these and just
chill at the front of the 7-11. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I would probably be there as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly this is why we like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is why konbinis are great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause sometimes you buy something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's way better than you expect to buy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at a convenience store. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This sake tastes way
too good for something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that just came out of a 250
yen convenience store sake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's actually not bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Wow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It doesn't really taste of much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what I mean, it's easy to drink. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's really easy to drink. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause a lot of like cheap sake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> usually has like a very harsh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> flavor.
- Honestly it's less, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it's less
offensive than the one that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Chris brought the other day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - This actually tastes better
than what Chris brought. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So Chris fucked us over, thanks Chris. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm still gonna to my beer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what I'm saying, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's the milliliter up to price ratio. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> But go on, you have two
more hot food items, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> what the fuck are they? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I do, I do, I don't know
what Ashley has bought me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But let's let's have a look. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay so the first one looks like a koroke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A potato? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so what a koroke is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is kind of just like
a potato katsu, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the way I would describe it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So sometimes, oh, that is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that is very oily.
- That's an oily boy! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is a very oily boy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Look at that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do we have more plates? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is literally, oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're going to get the desk all oily. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Look how, that is literally see-through. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That is, that is a see through. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is like the Simpsons episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with like Dr. Nick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is the Simpsons episode right here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> So what this is, I don't know what kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of koroke this is.
- You sure you wanna </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> crack that open on the table? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah it's all right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not a koroke. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What is this?
- Oh it's mince katsu. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so it's not a koroke, it's katsu. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like minced meat katsu, basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, I've never had this before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So essentially, you know what this is? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is literally a deep fried hamburger. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> This is what this is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> This is literally what this is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a deep fried hamburger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is, look at that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> This is basically a
hamburger, this is horrible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It doesn't smell bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what it smells like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It reminds me of like pies in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It does. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, a little bit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like a mince pie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It has a very pie smell. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if you can see this on camera </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the oil has seeped. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's disgusting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The oil has seeped through to the table. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It doesn't really taste of anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like meat and grease. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That's all I taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's like no seasoning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This tastes like, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Actually you don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How do you eat something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just have zero
opinion about the taste? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This tastes alright. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah it tastes like nothing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - This literally tastes like cardboard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because there's no taste in it at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you'd expect the burger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to have some kind of seasoning on it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This tastes like batter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Granted I've had really good mince katsu </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and this is definitely
- That's weak sauce. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - weak sauce compared to what I have. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What else did you get, Garnt? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Do you wanna see this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, sure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a spring roll. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You haven't all gotten
a spring roll from that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, oh, look at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Look at that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] That just looks sad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I do not stan this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Look at that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm going to cut this up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what this is? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know it's not good when
you're cutting a spring roll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it turns flat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a soggy spring roll right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't like spring rolls in general. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I don't like spring rolls. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're way too oily for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually that's not bad at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> How's it taste? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How does it taste? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's quite fatty somehow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like oily.
- It is very fatty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It tastes like a dim sum. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> A little bit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like the kind of oilyness. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like a really bad one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah it's like an oiliness of a dim sum. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I can see that actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know when you, 'cause
in the UK we have these like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> party platter things that
you get from Iceland. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's what it looks like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> So you thought you were
just gonna get a bite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of just pure like, just pastry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Was it pastry, is that what it is? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I think it's pastry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pastry, and then just,
maybe like a crumb of meat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And like that's normally how it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why I hate spring rolls, but that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That one was packed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, I'd get that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would actually get that, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, I did not expect
it to taste that good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It tastes like, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you said, like a mini dim sum, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but in a spring roll pastry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Wow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was not the taste I was expecting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's points for 7-11.
- I thought they would somehow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> make this one work and
fuck up the spring roll. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was the opposite way around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You surprise us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But there's tons of stuff
that we don't have here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the hot foods. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like they change all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like for example,
Lawson's has like hot dogs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that have like different
toppings, like salsa. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> There's like meat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, let's not forget it as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about like the nikkumans and the pizzamans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I think all of the
convenience stores have those. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nikkuman, what's it called,
just like a steamed bun? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, a steamed meat bun, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you can get like the
Chinese steamed meat buns. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - See them in all the animes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, like all of the meat buns </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in all three of the konbinis are lit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - And they taste really good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> They taste way too good.
- They taste really good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And those are really good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd fuck with the hot dogs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hot dogs are pretty fucking good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are they called, the goo dogs? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Goo dogs they're called. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And at one point, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So they also go through at all the chains. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They all go through seasonal items. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> One point they had like, mini burritos. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mini burritos? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, like microwaveable
burritos that were like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the size of that spring roll.
- Like proper, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like proper burritos? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If there's one food item that I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is really hard to get in Japan or one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> food cuisine, Mexican food.
- Mexican food, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so hard to get good
Mexican food in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can get any other, any other
food, I feel like I've had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I've gone to a restaurant
and I've been like, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is almost as good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - The only way you can get
Mexican food is to go to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> international chains that
just happen to be here right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And even then, like, we've been
to some Mexican restaurants. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - On my plate so we can
get rid of this shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - We've been to some Mexican restaurants </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I've always felt underwhelmed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's always, it's always
felt like the Mexican-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's sad because that's
the best you're gonna get. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We need more good Mexican in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm putting that out there
right now because Mexican, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Mexican food fucking slaps. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I get really sad 'cause
I watch on like YouTube, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I watch like, there's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Food Insider or whatever
the fuck they're called, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like videos, like, the
10 best burritos in LA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, Oh my God, all
of them look fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, there's, there's other food items </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well that are hot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you can get actual, like full meals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can get instant ramen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like, it's like a
solid, like frozen broth? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not really sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a block.
- It's like freeze dried. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a freeze dried
block, and it basically, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you microwave it, that
it melts and makes a broth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's actually like better
than most of the shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'll get ever in like America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh hands down, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, even like some
restaurants I've been to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they say ramen. And it was
like definitely not ramen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not ramen, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's actually not bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's also, you can get, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think Garnt has one of them with us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> So there's a bunch of variations. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Lawson's does a ton of like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean there's pastas as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah the pastas are lit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Pastas are, weird
combinations of pastas as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like stuff that like you would never see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> ever in Europe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Very Japanese twist on Italian food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> What's a weird combination they have? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They'll have like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fucking like egg and
tomato sauce or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - They put hot dogs in their pasta, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> some pastas as well.
- Yes, they put hot dogs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sausages in their pasta. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, sausages, tomato
sauce and spaghetti, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Alright. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Some of the pastas literally
look like a kid's meal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's true, it's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> They look like the dairy meal lunch pack, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Lunchables or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know when you're a kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you kind of make your own like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sandwich out of the Lunchables. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's like the equivalent
of putting into Japanese, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> sorry, Italian cuisine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Lawson's has like a premium
hot food section, which is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't include any that pasta shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's only Japanese and
normally fried food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But there is gyudon, and, pudon? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Gyudon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you know what gyudon is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Butadon? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Butadon, butadon,
that's what it is, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Butadon and gyudon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is like, gyudon is just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess strips of beef and then grilled </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then put with rice and
you normally get like a sauce </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or a mayo to dip it in
and put it in the rice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then butadon which is
my favorite, is just pork. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like strips of pork. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pork on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just pork on some rice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a pork bowl or a beef bowl, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're about to show you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This episode is sponsored by Harry's! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Too often we're choosing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> between quality or a fair price. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> With Harry's, you don't
have to choose gentlemen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They give you award-winning blades </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at factory direct prices. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - They give us both
quality and fair price? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought that was illegal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought that was illegal as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Now I will have to ask
boys when you got your first </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Harry's razor set and shaved with it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What surprised you most about
the quality of the products? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, for one, it comes
in a lovely cardboard box. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And look look at the packaging on this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This looks clean as fuck, look at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Goddamn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you go got there in your hand? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have here the body wash
which Meilyne literally said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> earlier, and I quote, "if you're lonely, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "you can know what a
boyfriend smells like." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean they're literally
giving life to dreams. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> For a limited time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Harry's is offering their starter set </SPEAKER_02>

- At harrys.com/trashtaste. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can see us live reacting to this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as we're reading it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is literally the
first time I've read that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's actually fucking-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it actually three dollars? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's actually three dollars. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's actually really good. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Harry believes
in quality so much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that they bought their
own factory in Germany </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it's German. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> So, you know, they're getting shit done! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I'm sitting here and I'm wondering, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how do they do it, Garnt? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Harry's team combined
a simple ergonomic design </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with five sharp blades. </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> and manufacture their blades </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> I have some 7-11 gyudon right here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It doesn't look appetizing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have also never seen that before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you never seen it before? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Honestly it fucking slaps. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It tastes great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Show it vertically to the camera. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay. I can't show it vertically. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause it's got, it's got
sauces in it, but look. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> What happens is that it comes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it comes with two compartments, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. There we go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just hope </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> none of the sauce falls out.
- Oh, there's juices! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The juices! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a lot of juices in here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what happens is it's
basically just grilled, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Grilled beef, beef
strips in whatever juices </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they cook it in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it comes with two compartments. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ah, that is, that is hot! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Comes with a rice compartment. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a common
mistake that people make. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Comes with a rice compartment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or you could just dump it all on, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or you can just take a piece at a time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You got two compartments. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> You can eat it however you like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like to dump it on.
- I'll give a shot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The reason, the reason
why they split it up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is so that--
- Can we put some spices </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> on this bitch as well, kind of just some, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> some like heat mix? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - - This is just an excuse </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for us to film eating our dinners right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not gonna lie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you can tell this is like super cheap </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because like it's, this
beef is half just fat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Look at that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like that is... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know the reason
though, why they split it off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> into two layers?
- That's the good part. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the good part.
- Oh my god. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know the reason why they split it up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into two layers though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why?
- It's so that the rice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> doesn't sog up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, obviously. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> You wouldn't want the rice
being soggy Joey, come on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, if you come to
Japan, try the beef bowls. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause the beef bowls are
by far my favorite like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 7-11 or whatever konbini you decide. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or you could go to the
top three beef bowl chains. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> or you could just go outside. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> There'll probably be a Matsuya Sukiya, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> or Yoshinoya right outside.
- Or Yoshinoya. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Look at that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's my favorite cheap Japanese dish. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yo, throw some of
that on my plate, Garnt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So do you get this often? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I get this whenever like
I'm traveling and I just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you can never go wrong with beef bowls. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - If I have to get a
meal, in Lawson's right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> they basically like a katsu-don </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they have like a,
it's really fucking good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Really clean katsu-don with just rice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like, perfect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And they give you all
like a fuckton as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Fuck, Garnt, you really
piled that on there, eh? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, I just... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You do like gyudon. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm more of a butadon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You will be the final judge
of this because you love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> your beef bowls, you love your gyudons. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I probably eat by far
the most beef bowls. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Out of the three of us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Gotta get the right ratio. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I do actually like mayo with mine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You like mayo with your beef bowls? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause some of the
chains will give you mayo, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and sometimes it's so
nice to have mayo with it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I know there's some people
who think that's disgusting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but you really like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause sometimes all you're getting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is just grease, grease, grease. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and Mayo helps like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I always get mine with Mayo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean I like the fat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah but sometimes you need to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mellow it out a little bit, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah but this man
doesn't like condiments, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so there's no use talking to him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow, that's not bad actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's good right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And how much is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is 400 yen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Four bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is literally, yeah,
this is about four bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you can get an entire meal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And it fucking slaps. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - For like a one off, it
was pretty fucking good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, if you're desperate
and you want a good meal, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that's actually not bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty surprised </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> about how good that is.
- If the gyudon man says so, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then it must be good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Obviously, you know, if
you go to Matsuya, Yoshinoya, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> or wherever, they literally
cook it in front of you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like, from fresh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is not bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you're out and about, and
you just want a quick meal, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you know, can't, there's no Matsuya, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or there's no like chain around you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Look he's going on for seconds, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's how good it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's that says more than anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - A little fatty. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But yeah, it was pretty
actually, yeah, I'd eat this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Would it be good for,
with some mayonnaise on it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Bit of mayonnaise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's not bad though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There you go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Points to 7-11 for that one, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah so there is tons of other hot food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that we couldn't get. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And also we just don't
wanna waste all of it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We don't want to throw away too much food. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - The staff is eating
all of it, don't worry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> So yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, that's most of the hot food </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that we to talk about today. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And the rest is just a bunch of snacks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - If there's one thing that all three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> convenience stores have it's snacks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They have way more snacks
than they do hot food, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think so.
- Oh way, way more. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Alright, so before we
move on, before we move on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from the hot foods. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So how long do you guys feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you can survive on
convenience store food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before you start to get bored of it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, I actually tried
that out once when I... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because it was the only option I had. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So basically when I was-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What do you mean it was
the only option you had? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, let me explain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When I was working, I was like 16 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was working at the ski
fields in Hokkaido, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm in the middle of
fucking nowhere in Hokkaido. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like in the mountains. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The only thing they had, I'm 16 as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I can't drive to the next-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And you can't afford
a fancy meal every time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't afford fancy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So basically I'm living day by day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with what they're paying me, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And also because it's snowing
fucking 24/7 there, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Without a car you're basically fucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Like you can't walk into a snow storm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> to like go to the next town. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not even your financial
advisor could save you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not even my financial
advisor could save me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But so the only thing they
had around where I was staying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was a Family Mart. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, that's why you're
a Family Mart stan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I literally, throughout
that entire month. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I would want to say
minimum two meals a day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyday for a month was Family Mart. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I felt like I wanted to
die by the end of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's only so much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like first week, you're
just like, all right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to try that bento,
I'm going to try that bento. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Basically. I like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like fully completed the Pokedex </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like, Family Mart food, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, yeah, I tried everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And once I did finish
everything, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I highly regret that I did that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I feel so fucking
unhealthy right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause the thing is when you come, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you come to Japan for the first time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you see how, just how
much choice of meals there are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> in every convenience store. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Especially for me coming
from England where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the only choice I have
is the Tesco's meal deal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hey, come on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't talk ill of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the best thing that we
have about our country. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But in terms of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> let's say packageable lunches or meals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can get away with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Lunchables? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not even Lunchables. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's all I think of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pastries? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's kind of about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You got sandwiches, you got... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think we all have, the
problem with the UK stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can like kind of take quickly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's all within like
the same genre of food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> There's no variety. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And the thing is only say, only like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the big super mega
stores have the hot food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like the fresh chickens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The hot food is good, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes you go to like, Sainsbury's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's the big Sainsbury's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and they have like the
hot rotisserie chickens. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Those actually slapped. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Tesco's have like the sausage. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The like foot-long
sausage that you can eat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> So good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - But those are limited to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the really, really big stores. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So the good thing about convenience stores </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that all this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like everything you see
is basically homogenous </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> throughout basically every
convenience store you can find. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> There are some that are bigger </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that have even more
choice of what you can buy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but we are showcasing
stuff that you can buy in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically every convenience
store you can get in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I do think when you, after living here, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> it's sort of like, you
view convenience food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> almost like McDonald's in my mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it starts to have
like a, almost McDonald's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> characteristic to the taste at
how, you know it's not like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not all fresh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't all taste quite like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> something's been a little too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, manufactured.
- It's not as healthy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as they package it out to be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean there were definitely
some healthy things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like there's some decent salads, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's some stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And like, I mean, after
the gym, I think we always, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we always just get like,
there's just chicken breasts. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Salad chicken, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So they have literal-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You have one of them, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> One of you has one of them.
- Do I have a chicken breast? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think Joey might have one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you buy a chicken breast? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, the only thing I
have is this sausage. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's just a sausage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just, it's from Johnsonville. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Amazing name for a sausage.
- I think that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> an American brand, is it?
- I think so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you can just rip it open </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and just start eating it, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just one sausage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> What I do have, it's not a chicken breast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Something similar like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but they literally have a, this is this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is a salad chicken bar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what a salad chicken bar is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] What the fuck is that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like a salad in a bar with chicken. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> What is that shape? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> No chicken has ever been in that shape. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What is that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a chicken sausage almost. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So normally the ones that I get, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and they also have them at
Family Mart and Lawson's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why they
wouldn't have them at 7-11. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a salad chicken nugget. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Imagine literally a
chicken breast seasoned. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the one that I always
go for is tandoori flavored. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The tandoori one slaps. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Chicken tandoori. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's literally just a chicken breast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> just in a vacuum sealed
package that has just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> been cooked and you just eat.
- Yeah, the vacuum seal, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> vacuum seal package like this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Crack that bad boy open at like 3:00 AM </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's like, really good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - You go for a workout, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, you want to get some protein. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's the best source of protein? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Just eat a fucking whole chicken breast. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 20 grams of protein. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Boom, you're talking. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause normally like,
it makes it so convenient </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because no matter what mood or no matter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what kind of food you want, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they probably have it at
your convenience store. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you want something healthy, you can... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh god, that looks awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That looks, oh, show
the gloss to the cameras. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God.
(Joey cackling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Look at that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yo, give me a bite of that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Here, let's cut that up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is glossier than some nails. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That looks vile. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Let me try that, let me try that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where's the knife? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Ashley, get us a knife. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Okay, go ahead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just gimme one of those. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yay, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh this feels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what this, it feels plastic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll try it, but I'm
not going to like it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - This looks like a hot dog
with extra peppers on it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Honestly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God it tastes
like a chicken hot dog. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's fucking weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, that's just a chicken hot dog. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if you were supposed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to take the skin off of those though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a chicken hot dog. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I like how they call it a salad chicken </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when it's just a chicken hot dog. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well Japan's not going to know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a chicken hot dog is probably. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you know what they
call corn dogs here? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, America dogs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - America dogs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, honestly, that's
a pretty fucking good name. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's a pretty accurate name. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, what are the hot
dogs that they eat in America? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Corn dogs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Alright, gentlemen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We all have sandwiches
from our respective stores. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I want to know which
sandwich is your go to? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - For me it's always this one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Tuna and tamago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh fuck my bag got crushed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But, honestly I'm not
making this look appetizing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but same Joey! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You'll notice though, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the difference between the Family Mart </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the Lawson sandwiches with the, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> especially with the egg. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> The egg, in Family Mart, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it kind of like.
- They actually use </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sliced eggs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah they slice the eggs, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whereas Lawson is just fully scrambled. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And honestly, yeah, this shit slaps. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This shit is insane. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly both of them slap, I feel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And what the fuck does Garnt have? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - They didn't have the
sandwiches I asked for, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is just a katsu sando. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So a katsu sando is literally
just like a pork katsu. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just with some bread slapped on the side </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and some katsu sauce. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the fuck is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> see, I've always seen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So show it to the camera. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I'm always seeing this, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You should put it in frame
with us so that it's in frame. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's literally like
a strawberry shortcake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> turned into a sandwich. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That looks awful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Can you crack that open? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've always seen those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they sell those
at Family Mart too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I've never tried them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Also the genius, Japanese
packaging, you just, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a little slip that
you pull open and boom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's ready to go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Everything convenient.
- And it folds outward </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like that, isn't that amazing? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That's just beautiful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is Japanese engineering
to the finest level. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - And boom, you've got a little
picnic for your sandwiches. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - How do you feel about
the lack of crust, boys? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Disgusting.
- Not gonna lie, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's disappointing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean look at this, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like there's something missing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the bite of the crust. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I agree.
- It's beautiful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I agree.
- It's beautiful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you guys give a
shit if I rip some off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and hand it to you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, just you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you try that egg
on, that's the real egg. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the best, look at the color. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Look at the fucking bright, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the saturation has been
pumped to 10,000 on that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> You know that shit's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna taste good.
- This one's got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> some slices in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've had this one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, that that feels like a weak bread. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're all weak breads,
what are you talking about? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh god it's been dunked in the grease. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know how to properly share this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh it's cross contaminated. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh no! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which tamago are we trying first? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's try the Family Mart one first. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So the, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's the one with the slices on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly like what I
love about Japanese eggs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that they just have the color in them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Every Japanese egg just is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like they took the egg, the egg yolk, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> put it in Photoshop and
turned up the saturation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It looks beautiful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is like way too
yellow for it to be real. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I like the egg. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> The problem I have with
this sandwich, sorry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm eating with my mouth. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is the tuna tastes like shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You think so? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - On this sandwich, I think so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the tuna tastes the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, you'll see what I mean, Garnt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, I really liked the egg. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like the egg to be solid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love the egg slices. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right let's try the
Lawson egg sandwich then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So this one is no egg
slices is just fully mashed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What I don't like about this one and why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never bought this
one is because this egg </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looks like runny yolk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No honestly, it's good try it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It looks like shit the
that comes out of your nose, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like runny egg yolk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Definitely a lot more of like
a mayonnaise flavor in this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No I prefer, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I prefer to chew on my eggs and I feel it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll give you that one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> That like, there is
something about knowing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like an egg slice in that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's way more comforting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to try and fucking dissect this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This isn't working. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> This isn't working. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sandwiches were just
not meant to be shared. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's be honest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just going to rip it off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here you go Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Try some real fucking tuna
tasting sandwich action. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Give me some of that sandwich. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, like when
it comes to the tuna, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it all tastes the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No I disagree.
- What I want to mention </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> though is that all the breading </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for all the sandwiches
in Japan, it's so fluffy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so light and fluffy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's why it's some of my
favorite breads, I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my god I just realized
we're breaking bread guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like true comrades. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which one are we eating first? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm the Family Mart one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's the difference? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Again, there is no difference. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no, no, I can spot which one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> That one's Lawson's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No that's Lawson's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can tell the difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh no actually (stammering). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'ma call sus on this one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, no, the bread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> The bread's different. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - The bread hit different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No listen, listen, try it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you'll know what I, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shit, I should put that on the table. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You'll know what I mean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> You'll know what I mean.
- Honestly, Garnt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you're you're the
mediator in this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Have both of those </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and tell me if there's
a fucking difference. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They taste different. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like the Family Mart one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, it's got a weird tinge to it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's try the Lawson one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay so this one's
the Lawson one, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, let me try both. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It tastes the fucking same, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> oh actually hold on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah, see? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> See what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Lawson one's better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, okay, I agree.
- Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The Lawson one actually
tastes like tuna. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's so clean. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what it is, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The Lawson tuna sandwich? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like the initial taste. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I bit into both. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And the initial taste
was just like, hmm, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> They both taste the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then the aftertaste
from the Lawson's tuna, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you actually get a taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of tuna.
- It tastes like fish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it tastes like fish. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So if you like the taste of fish, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd say the Lawson one is better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you don't like the taste of fish, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd say the Family Mart one is better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I'll give that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Alright let's try the-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now let's try this abomination. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Honestly there's a part of me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's a part of me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's thinking this is going to be good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Although mine's contaminated with egg. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is my only strawberry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've only got one strawberry as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've got two in mine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly, one thing that
the sandwiches are guilty of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> doing here is that they
look loaded in the front. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They look like they're filled. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you take one bite and you realize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> there's nothing in the back.
- They clickbait you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's literally like the
Walker's crisps where, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you bite into it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and most of it is just air. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I found that Family
Mart does that the worst. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You think so?
- Family Mart has this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> sandwich, right, that I used
to get from Family Mart, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is egg and ham, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And in the front man, it
looks like it's bursting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It can't wait to get out,
and you take one bite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you realize that
it goes from like, this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so thin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Alright, let's give this a shot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> That's not a sandwich. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's just a cake. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's just, yeah, it's a dessert. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a strawberry shortcake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's really fucking weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause you know what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It tastes like a strawberry shortcake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But then you're just chewing bread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Proof that bread works
with fucking anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I, that, that tastes wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not a fan of that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would rather just eat
a strawberry shortcake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like the equivalent
of putting a burger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> or putting a patty between two, two bread, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> two bread slices, and calling it a burger. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah I've always seen those being sold. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Because I think they sell all of those </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at like Lawson and 7-11, Family Mart. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, they all have dessert sandwiches, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is just fucking weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I saw one with like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I saw one where it was
like, cream and lime? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cream and lime? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not lime, sorry, kiwi, kiwi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was kiwi slices with like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whipped cream.
- Kiwi and lime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I've seen that one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was like, that looks fucking wack. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - One thing I will say, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the whipped cream they use here in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's S-tier whip cream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I agree. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Whipped cream to me doesn't really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fucking taste like anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I just kinda like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You taste Japanese whipped cream, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you think it tastes like, you taste? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can stan that better. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't like whipped cream. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're telling me that the whipped cream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> did not carry what you
just ate right there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly the bread kind of carried it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Get out of here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This man I swear. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had like one quarter
of a fucking strawberry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> There's nothing happening. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I used to fucking despise like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all cakes and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like strawberry shortcake,
I was like, nah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's some boring shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but then I had strawberry
shortcake here and I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my god. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was exactly the same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Strawberry shortcake here blew my mind, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because the cake part is so fluffy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The cream, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - The whipped cream,
Japanese whipped cream </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is the best I've tasted in the world. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I agree. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I will stand by that.
- I agree with that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And that's why Japanese
sweets tastes so good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> A lot of it is just-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The whipped cream. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So what are we trying next lads? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Should we try like the
more like savory snacks? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe like the fish and the meat snacks? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you guys have any of those? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So gentlemen, as you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one of the most well-known food items </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - What was that?
- from Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was like, uh, uh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was trying to figure out
what I was trying to say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But one of the most well-known food items </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> from Japan is of course the jelly donut. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> AKA. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Actually you took me back
there, like wait, what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The onigiri. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Which if you've seen, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> if you basically watch any anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've seen characters eating onigiri. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The rice balls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is basically the closest we get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to an actual Japanese sandwich. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's a rice
sandwich, basically, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is a... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, whoa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, oh, oh my God.
- What is that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did not, where's the seaweed? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Where is the seaweed? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like the best part. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like the hot dog wrapper, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> The best part of a hot
dog is the crunch, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> What is that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is a grilled salmon onigiri. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh I have a grilled salmon
one as well, from Family Mart. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay we all grilled
- I also have a grilled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> salmon one.
- salmon onigiri. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So yeah, as you know, me and
Garnt actually ate onigiri, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and this is actually one
of them that I was eating, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was quite delicious
as much as I was complaining. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Show business. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Acting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, that is my
favorite onigiri to get, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from Lawson's. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've never seen that one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What'd you mean, from Lawson's? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You mean from all of the places, Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Now Lawson's, like every
good big brain company, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> has their own product line,
specifically for onigiri. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They have the basic bitch onigiri. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like 100 yen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Now this is shit is like 190 yen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ooh, that's the premium shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Premium. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> You can't even see it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's how premium it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, I will stan 7-11
hot foods and fried foods. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't stan its onigiri. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the most
depressing looking onigiri </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sorry.
- Look at that Joey! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Looks like someone
put the condom on wrong. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - They put the condom on sideways </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> instead of on top. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Now gentlemen, let me show
you what a good onigiri. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay actually that could-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It looks the same! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just a bigger condom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, that's how it
should look, look at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's just a bigger condom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's so beautiful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, it's beautiful, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because every bite you get,
you get a bit of seaweed in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the perfect ratio. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Here's the thing that differentiates </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> between a good onigiri and bad onigiri. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the rice to insides ratio. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 100% agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 100% yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If there's like, the
first bite you bite into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in an onigiri and you
immediately hit the inside, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's a good onigiri. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, to be fair, a
lot of the cheap ones, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or even sometimes like if
they've just filled it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> not quite right that one
time you do just get like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> four bites in and you're
like, where is the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking filling?
- Where's the filling? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I gotta ask. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you boys actually eat onigiri anymore? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah I still do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I gave up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I do whenever I need a quick, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whenever I literally need a quick snack. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm just never in the
mood for a block of carbs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, there's not enough filling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd rather just have a block of-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, you get the fucking
microwaveable goo dogs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's if like, I want to fucking, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna pig out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I haven't had a goo dog in a long time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause like, that shit is just dreadful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly, because sometimes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes I miss my lunch
and I have like a filming </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> or something and I just
need to fill up my stomach </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as quickly as possible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that's when I get
just like one onigiri, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that lasts me until dinner. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it does everything it needs to do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - What is your favorite
filling of the onigiri? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> So there's different flavors
that you could have in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh god, that's hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Normally all fish, there
is sometimes grilled chicken </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not not a fan of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chicken breast though.
- Don't get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause the good part about the fish one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> is that normally it like seeps
into the rest of the area. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But the chicken one just
is a ball in the middle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'd have to say the tuna is probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> my favorite.
- The tuna is my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> favorite as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually you are holding my favorite one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is the salmon belly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's really, really good premium salmon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In terms of the chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> How'd you guys feel
about the onigiri where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it doesn't really have a filling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just kind of like the grilled rice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> with grilled chicken or whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I used to eat those when I was little. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But as I got older, I was
like, nah, I just want, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I want something more like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Satisfying.
- It feels like a fake, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feels like a fake meal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> When I first visited Japan, I fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all I had was like onigiri. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think everyone's like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah because you're like,
oh my god, I'm in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I gotta eat the Japanese things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't get this at home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can get a sandwich at home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then when I started
living here, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yo, the sandwiches are
pretty fucking bomb. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Have you tried these sandwiches? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, nearly the same price. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What am I doing, man? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And sandwiches are easier to eat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause sometimes onigiri falls apart, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if you like, if you're, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes you're in a rush. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you're bad at eating it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Onigiri to me, I'd never
eat onigiri as a meal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if I'm having a
lunch, I never pick onigiri </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as the lunch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Onigiri is a convenience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> if I need to stuff myself
and have it not taste awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just realized there's
no way for us to like share. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've just gotta bite into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's all salmon onigiri. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - To be fair, I've never
tried the Family Mart </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> branded onigiri before.
- I have never tried </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the Seven onigiri yet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've had this one before and it's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just gonna do a bite
just to prove that it's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh look at that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Immediately. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How deep would I have
to bite, do you reckon, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to get the filling, Joey? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just bit a whole ton of rice, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it didn't even have any seaweed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I hit like one millimeter of fish though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Let me give a bite. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How deep, this deep? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Mmm, I already broke into salmon. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look at that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mine, like my salmon actually has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a little bit of like soy sauce in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the soy sauce kind of seeped
into the rice a little bit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's good.
- That's really flavorful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's nice, fatty salmon. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> This is awful, I do not... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Honestly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this is the most depressing
looking grilled salmon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I've ever seen.
- 7-11, fix your shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, so we can say
Family Mart and Lawson </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have got their branded
onigiri pretty down pat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah if you want the
best onigiri from a chain, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I would highly recommend </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Lawson's.
- I would highly recommend </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Lawson's as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Lawson's, especially the
grilled salmon belly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That is fucking bomb. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - What other cold or savory snacks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do you guys tend to go for? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay we have the... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You don't eat that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I do not eat this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know what this is? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is the seafood sticks that you see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> in every Asian restaurant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I don't know why every
Asian restaurant serves these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> seafood sticks.
- Look, I don't wanna make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this a dick measuring
contest, but mine's bigger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Although to be fair. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't eat these, but every now and then, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Aki asked me to come and buy
like one of these crab sticks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, I tried it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's actually kind of good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> If you like like crab, especially. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - This isn't just like crab or fish. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is fish paste, cheese, and cod roe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That sounds dreadful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Oh, that sounds awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - My one's got like,
mayonnaise inside of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a seafood stick, spicy roe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - That looks fucking awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my god.
- That looks disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Look at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] I'm gonna try this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is just like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, smell it, smell it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh that smells awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That smells like off tuna. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh it just dribbled. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Smell that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ooh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That does smell like
bad tuna, doesn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ooh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I really don't wanna eat it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is like the
fishiest fish smell ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what, I'm not
even gonna open this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just gonna eat yours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, when you just have fish </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's been left out for a few days? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what this smells like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It smells like cat-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - The thing is, I usually
fuck with the crab sticks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at like summer festivals
and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I hope this is something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's not good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just, it's bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not good, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> No, that is, that is bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's awful, that is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I just prefer the normal crab stick. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Don't put shit in it,
don't put cheese in it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't even taste the cheese. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't like crab.
- I definitely taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the cheese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, I don't like crab sticks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't mind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Crab is one food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I think just doesn't
taste good processed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And crab sticks just feel like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> they feel like such processed food. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like canned lobster,
you don't can lobster. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No one wants canned lobster.
- But you gotta have, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> with the crab sticks though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I used to think the same, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like you go to like
a summer festival and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you get the ones that are
like on the fucking grill with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the fucking sauce.
- Oh yeah, I bet that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking good, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That shit is fire. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah but it's not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think it's the
crab that tastes good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the fact that it's grilled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's got the sauce on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd rather have another. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It can be good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's really good, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This video is sponsored by Bokksu, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Connor, what is Bokksu? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bokksu is the only Japanese snack box </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that partners with over 100
year old family snack makers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> to deliver Japan's exclusive
snacks right to your door. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I have to say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never seen any of these at a konbini. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> So that probably means they're premium. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Look at this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I love my soft cookies and this, oh, this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna have this later.
- Well boys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> March is the start of the hanami season. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> What's hanami, Joey? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or the cherry blossom season in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as it's called.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So to commemorate that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Bokksu orders placed in
March will get a special </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> hanami themed pink box instead
of Bokksu's signature orange. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But be quick because
these stocks are limited. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] I'm showing the box. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's right here! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] You can't see! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] First time Bokksu customers </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> a themed box every month. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Gentlemen, what kind
of snacks do you like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm a giant senbei fan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And this is a rather
extraordinary looking senbei. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the black Sesame
taiko with the kumamon design. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I love me some sesame. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I'm very down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What do you got there Garnt? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have here a cookie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Joey, what is this cookie? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, that's the aomuri
apple caramel yakkoi sable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Damn, that sounds sexy.
- Aomori is famous </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> for their apples, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All I know is I like me
my soft cookies, and this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That looks so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is a nice soft moist cookie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - God I want a cup of tea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Best part is, it's vegetarian. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Ooh! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Joey, what's yours? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, my favorite one is the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stick potato supamucho plum. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> We talked about the sour
plums on this episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you know me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love me my sour plums. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So if there's a sour plum snack, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know I'm gonna dig that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ooh, that looks nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And gentlemen I'm sure we can all agree </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that ever since moving to Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Japan's snack game is
just on another level. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> - What'd you got there Conner? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> What do you got there Conner? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is a rather odd looking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like a fucking whole deli. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, it's just a bunch of
cuts of bacon, it looks like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but like, sausages. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're about to show
off why Japanese bacon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is just one of the worst bacons
you can find in the world. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll try my best to hold this up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> without burning myself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so this is Japanese bacon here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is a meat platter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And as you can see,
it is floppy and soggy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh god, oh god. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't flop it around! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Hold still. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just want to show off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that this is not what bacon
should look like or feel like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is two kinds of
sausage and pepper bacon. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, what are we trying? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I'll, you know, I'll
try the one kind of sausage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll try the other kind then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Whatever one is-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Should we just cut one in half actually? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - But what else do you have
there in the meantime Joey, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> while I prepare this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, well I know you guys
have never tried this but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we have Nankone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Shiu nonkone, which is pickled plums. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pickled plums. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You think I haven't tried that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually have tried that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, but there's two different types. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because, for some reason, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Sidney fucking loves pickled plums. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I do not know why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here's the thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Literally, I dunno if
this is just a stereotype, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> literally every female I
know loves pickled plums. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like if it's plum, if
it's like an actual plum, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> plum flavored things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meilyne it true? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Meilyne, do you like pickled plum? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what I'm saying! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Chicks love pickled plums. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Literally every Japanese girl I know loves </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> pickle plum flavored shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Alright boys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Tell me what kinds of sausage
you would like to have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just give me one of them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What are the different, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, this just--
- It looks like a finger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's basically, they call-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like straight up a finger, look! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It looks like a finger! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like fucking out of Yoshikage, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's out of Kira's collection, man! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yoshikage Kira's collection.
- That's one thing that Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just doesn't do and it's sausages. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like they just don't do them, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, they'll they'll go
around calling this chorizo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like that's what they, in restaurants. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is not chorizo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They will call this chorizo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's a joke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean it's literally a hot dog. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, it's just a sausage, eh? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just a hot dog. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just a sad frankfurt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can palate cleanse
though with a kitsunanko... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - They don't need to see this.
- Let me try the bacon. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah it's shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here, I'll give you
guys the pickled plums </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause we have three. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so this is actually something new. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They, you know, I'm sure
the viewers watching, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they've tasted bacon before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They've tasted sausages. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They've tasted hot dogs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What they haven't tasted pickled plums. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So Japan is like kind of known </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> for its pickled plum. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Umeboshi it's called. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, umeboshi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But basically there's
two types of umeboshi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> There's the really, really
sour types of umeboshi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you find-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the only one I've had. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the sweet umeboshi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sweet umeboshi? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yes, this amakachu umeboshi. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - This one too? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> these are all the same.
- So this is the sour one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No these are the sweet ones. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> These are all sweet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll try it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a slightly salted sweet umeboshi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh shit, it's dripping everywhere. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, watch out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. let me taste this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know you guys
haven't tried this, but-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why does it look like
a deflated scrotum? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's been, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's been dried basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What do you think? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not a fan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm still not a fan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what'd you do, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just take a big bite? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, there's a seed inside of it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> so watch out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Watch out for the seed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so sour! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is the sweet one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the sweet one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is sweet? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In what universe is this sweet? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, this is the sweet one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So if you have the sour
one, it's literally like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> What's the most sour thing you
can normally get in like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sour Patch Kids. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's way more sour than that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know that one video
we did with Joey's channel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> where we had to, the powdered sour. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It just tastes like a bite of that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's basically pickled plum. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah it's like, there's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I bought this thing for my channel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is pure umeboshi extract. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's considered one of the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sour things in the world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's basically you start
salivating immediately. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's one of the most sour things
you can just naturally get. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> My grandma used to hand make these. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> So that's why I have a special </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> thing for them.
- I do think there was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot at play of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I am not used to these foods. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And although I'm more than
happy to try every single item. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It doesn't mean I have to
like every single item. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No of course not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What I don't understand
about pickled plums. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that why'd you like
eating something that sour? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it's so sour, it's more
sour than any kind of sweet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or any kind of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I used to like, cause
again, like my grandma </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> used to like hand-make the
umeboshi, and would just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> send it in tupperware, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like, it is the
most sour shit imaginable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I used to just come home
- If I had a Japanese grandma </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that made it for me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sure I'd love the
fuck out of it, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would just come home after school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just get the tupperware
and just fucking eat it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's got love in it Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That didn't have love. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> That had factories and suffering. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That tastes like shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - My grandma's umeboshi's the best. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you mouth just look like this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, all the time,
but I fucking loved it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause that's me after
one bite of eating umeboshi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I dunno, I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Another item that you
can get that, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you won't really find
elsewhere in the world probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> is a lot of dried fish items
that are like snackable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - So Garnt has some... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have some squid and
seaweed tempura chips. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - So tempura is a kind of light batter. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a light batter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for frying, yeah.
- For frying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have salmon skin chips, which, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they really didn't do good
with a good name there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I kind of fuck with these. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I like these. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I also really fucking love
all of the squid stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like fried squid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's the other one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The dried squid? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dried squid as well I like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They have like a certain
type of frying technique </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> for some of the squids
that are really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- It looks fucking vile </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you pull this out of
the package, like octopus, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it looks so gross. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's pretty good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So should we bust some of these open? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, let's try them out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't think I have any. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Joey, you wanna have, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh actually you know what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Wow, they look like crisps. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So these are designed to
basically look like fish crisps. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's crazy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> That's kind of epic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's kinda epic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's an epic gamer moment right there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Look at that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I'll hold one up, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, look at that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> That could be like a square. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you have squares in Australia? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're British crisps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - No I don't think so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They look exactly like this, don't they? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Wow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But they also, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean they smell like
you think they smell. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a very fishy smell that
they smell like, obviously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause it's fish.
- That's good, I like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> With a beer? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - With a beer, oh, we'll do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> With a beer, cheers boys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cheers, gentlemen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (can opening) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Mmm. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Mmm. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I love that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like I just
worked a hard day fishing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the middle of nowhere in Aomori. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like it takes me back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Honestly, these taste so good with beers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I just kind of want to keep eating these. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yo, give me one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Give me one of those. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's try one of these. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Try one of these. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think I've
tried these, actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - These have a bit more bite to them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Ooh! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yo! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That's good! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They've got some texture
to them, don't they? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's like the unhealthier
version of this, I suppose. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause this, it's basically, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> this is basically that
with a bit more batter. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So you've got a bit more of a bite. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I might prefer these ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Those are nice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> These have a nice crunch to them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm having another one, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let me bring out a snack that
another snack that I'm sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you guys have probably never
seen or heard of before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm glad that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm glad that Ashley brought them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's kaninto. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - What is that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ah, I did buy these one time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought they were chocolate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They weren't chocolate.
- Most people will look at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> this and go, oh look, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's actual pieces of turd. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought it was chocolate, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was so hype to dig in! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically it is black sugar particles. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But when you pull it out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Black sugar particles? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really selling me on this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like fried black sugar right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty sure that's what it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That sounds like a physics term. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - But when you pull it out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it straight up just looks like a turd. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know what to tell you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a very fancy
name for a turd there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That looks Brian Griffin's poop. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] There you go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what that looks,
you know what this looks like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This looks like a turd that
like a Pomeranian would do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cheers?
- Like a small dog. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cheers?
- Cheers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (crunching) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That ain't bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It just tastes like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sugar with air. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just sugar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It just tastes like a crisp sugar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's basically just deep fried sugar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I honestly don't really like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a, black sugar is
kind of a hit or miss </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with a lot of people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a miss. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So the thing is I couldn't
eat a whole packet of these. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I chomp on one of these,
I'm like, that was nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Am I, am I getting a
craving to go for one more? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Nope. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> One's enough for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait, what, what is
this in Japanese again? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is called kokto karinto. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - What a fucking name. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kokto is black sugar, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> karinto is like the name
of the actual snack. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - How unhealthy is it to
just eat the entire thing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's the calories on that one? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Calories? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 698. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Per how many grams? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - For the whole bag. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> 135 grams.
- Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How much sugar is in that bitch? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, you're just eating pure sugar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no, no, wait. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 37 grams. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait, that's way less than I expected. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it just feels like
you're eating fried sugar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's actually more carbs in this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's 81 grams of carbs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Holy fuck.
- What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's seven grams of
protein in this thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh well great, after a workout. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah perfect for after a workout. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where's the protein coming from? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have no idea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where the fuck is the
protein coming from? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have no idea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They're literally making
protein out of thin air here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Japan be doing that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Did they just put like a
bit of protein powder in it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just like balance it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're going to make
this healthy somehow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Shall we get out something else? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A giant bag full of things now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> these are more like, I
guess sweets or kind of. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Should we just dump
the rest on the table </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and see what we got? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Look at all that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Holy fuck I have a lot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> more than you guys.
- Let's see what Santa </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> brought us.
- I have way more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> than I think you guys do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What is that that you bought? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So many, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I do have that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So many sweets there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Alright. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Should I just start with the
stuff that looks interesting? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay first of all, one of
my favorite Japanese snacks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> it's gotta be top, it's top
tier for me, this is S-tier. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mochi senbei? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Senbei in general. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, senbei in general. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not mochi, but senbei in general, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a senbei store
not too far from us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I go there like every week to get my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weekly supply of senbei.
- Yeah, I do as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh fuck, senbei is so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you don't know it's
like a rice cracker. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's basically like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it doesn't feel too heavy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you can have like one or two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you feel like really satisfied. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not too bad for you either. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean it is just like, rice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It feels like a crisp. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But just lighter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And for some reason it's more filling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> than a single crisp. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, an entire packet of senbei </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like a meal.
- So this is mochi, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> oh my god, whoa, this has
a funky texture to it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it soft? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's like a soft cookie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> a soft baked senbei. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Woo, okay, is it chewy? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It looks chewy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is, yeah, so mochi senbei </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is kind of in the same. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So there's different types. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> There's hard senbei and
then there's soft senbei. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's hard senbei, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there's rock
fucking solid senbei. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There are some senbei where
I've had, there was one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was like, it was like
yuzu pepper or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like oh, that sounds amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I order it, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I fucking like,
break my teeth I swear, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> biting on this shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is it like a jawbreaker </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of senbei?
- Honestly, there's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's the perfect
hardness which is just, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> cracks immediately upon... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a rice cracker. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, that's what you want. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then some of them it just feels like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you're biting into a stone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's pretty weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Huh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If this was a cookie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I would think this is the
perfect kind of texture </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm looking for in a cookie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's actually one
more level above this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> called nure senbei which
literally means wet senbei. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like actually like wet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But they make it for old
people who can't like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> break into it.
- Aww. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> That's wholesome, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's give it a shot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Whoa, that's weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so mochi rice
is actually different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from regular rice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Mochi rice is a lot softer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and a lot more like squishier. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So you get something like this, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a little wack aint it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Whoa, that's so bizarre! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what it is? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's moist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - To explain-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why's Meilyne laughing,
what's funny Meilyne? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Meilyne] I just love Garnt's reaction. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To explain what I just experienced. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So as we said, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this has the perfect texture
for like a good cookie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like my experience has
told me that this is good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm going to bite into this
and it's going to taste sweet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And what I tasted was a salted cracker </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with a moist cookie texture. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It isn't bad though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd eat it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I wouldn't search
for it, but I'd eat it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That, that was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that texture and taste just
doesn't belong together. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, something about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've kind of been conditioned, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I, taste it and it tastes good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I feel the texture and
the texture feels good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but together it just does
not synergize at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like anti umami, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a plus and
a minus put together. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, it looks like you
have a senbei there. Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> A big boy senbei. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have a proper senbei. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a kabukiage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> This is my favorite type of senbei. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Kabukiage.
- Fucking hell Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fucking--
- Yeah, Jesus. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just wanted to try how hard it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - We actually have the smaller kabukiage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> These ones I buy quite regularly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - These ones, I like these. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> But when you have like four or
five, you start to feel sick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah.
- 'Cause they're so like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> what's the word to
describe, maybe just fat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (crunching) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - These are really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So there it's like, how
would you describe the texture? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cavernous. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like The Thing from
fantastic four, isn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It kinda does. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know what it
is that's like amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like one or two bites, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> but really like sickly after like three. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I dunno, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I could destroy a whole packet of these. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe it's just me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's gotta be just me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> This is not bad though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - These are my favorite
types of senbeis I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So this tastes exactly the
same as what we just had. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but this is the texture I
imagine that taste having. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just like, it's a nice salty cracker </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just with a bit more air in between. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or like it's, it's fatter than the cracker </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's lighter than the cracker. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's kind of like eating card and foam. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Just like flavored. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Alright Joey, what are
we having from yours? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, so I've never </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actually seen this before.
- The fuck is that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I know this brand, Baby Star Ramen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That looks like a ramen.
- Baby Star Ramen is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So basically Baby Star Ramen is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the kind of really, what's the word? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like the dried out ramen? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh is it the instant ramen? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like the instant
ramen looking things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's in a snack form. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I guess this is like
the mazesoba flavored one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which I've never seen before.
- Crank that bitch up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> So you just eat it dry? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh look at that, it's like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like little snacks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's literally tiny instant ramen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That looks next level. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I need to try this, here you go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know, I hate this
is my first concern </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but this just cannot be even
remotely healthy, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of course it's not healthy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's literally fried
instant ramen noodles. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I kinda like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I dunno if you did the
same thing, but as a child. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes you would, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes I would take instant ramen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like hardened instant ramen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and just kind of like smash
it up into little pieces, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> put the like, the seasoning
on it and just eat it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it was like a snack. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - We had a brand of that,
it's called Mami noodles. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> They would actually sell
packets of that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was the best. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What are you in prison? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What do you do that for? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it tastes
fucking great, fuck off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ashley, you know Mami noodles, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Ashley] I did the same
thing when I was young. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right!
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you never had
like, the ramen seasoning, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or the instant noodle seasoning? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It tastes fucking bomb. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like putting the seasoning off-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like MSG. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like pure MSG.
- Pure MSG. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Alright, now I'm salty. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ask a kid I was told to never do that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's unhealthy as fuck, but. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I guess someone
grew up and was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can make a product out of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This literally tastes like childhood. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It tastes like every Asian childhood. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's got a little spice to it too, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is nice.
- Ooh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Meilyne] So good on salad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so good on salad.
- On salad? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You mean croutons? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're not croutons. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah they're not croutons. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They do look like croutons. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - They kind of look like croutons. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a Japanese crouton. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Watashi no, what is that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Karashi? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Karashi, what is that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's mustard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't actually know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what it is.
- Crack it open. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, let's crack it open.
- This is from Lawson's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Our intern just bought it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] I have no
idea what it is either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] What is that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That just looks like
a potato chip I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my god, that has a kick to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - There we go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] That has a kick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not a fan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you don't like condiments. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is like condiments in a snack. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It tastes like mayo and
mustard in like a crisp. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's so weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually kind of fuck with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What the fuck is wrong with you guys? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Condiments. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Condiments are meant to be, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are meant to enhance food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're not meant to be the food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I literally just ate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I literally just ate
hardened mustard and mayo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually kinda like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, it's actually kind good eh? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It has a really strong
like mustard kick to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - So I'll pick another one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I have too many. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What looks interesting? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> That's, we literally just
have these in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What are those? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Biscuits? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, the cream sandwiches. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> The custard creams? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Custard cream biscuits? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what they look like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is cognac chip seaweed and salt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Konyaku? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Konyaku. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Low in calories, Natural Lawson's, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Should we give it a shot? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Konyaku does have zero calories, so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, well, well, gamers,
let's give it a shot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Garnt, go ahead. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Thank you very much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Go ahead. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Look at that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That looks healthy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if that's a good comment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can literally see through it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's how you know how healthy it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay it doesn't taste like anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That is the most inoffensive thing ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That tastes like air with
like a hint of seaweed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Try these, try these. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The moment like moisture hits it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just dissolves and disappears. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was literally like eating nothing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know what it was? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> A Rice Krispie if it had
been scaled up in size, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but not with like the added ingredients </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> needed to scale it up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's literally just going
into Photoshop and going. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you seen that video on the internet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where someone manages
to like, deep fry water? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, someone managed to deep fry water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Like a packet of water. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's what I imagine that tastes like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why would they do that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why would they do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Alright, I've got here, Castella. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I fucking love these. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what Castella is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh Castella, that's a
specific type of Japanese-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because normally it's in like a block. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a block, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which country is Castella from? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look it up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is Castella? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you want to explain what it is? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - We'll find out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] I did buy one, Castella. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Castella's like a cake of kinds, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Or it's like a pastry? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay it looks like a pastry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's really fucking good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Meilyne] Japan made it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Meilyne] Developed in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so it's made in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> looks like a little pastry.
- Dude it's good, try it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a cream puff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, let me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mmm. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, that's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> That is fucking good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Meilyne] Imported, but Spanish made. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Spanish. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Spanish, I thought so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Spanish. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mmm! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] Portuguese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Meilyne] Portugal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Portugal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that nice or not? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> That is a nice clean cake.
- That is fucking nice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> One thing I've noticed about
the pastry here that I love. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Everything is fluffy as fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, so fluffy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I love-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yo, give me another one of those. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Those are fucking great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You guys want a Castella? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like from the shortcake, to the bread, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to the whipped cream,
to the fucking Castella. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Everything is so fluffy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Soft and fluffy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Soft and fluffy.
(moans) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw a bit just fucking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is why it's so
easy to eat sweets here, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because they find a different way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to market different kind of sweets, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they all taste fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You really can't go wrong with sweets. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well I'm gonna try something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> from the Family Mart collection. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Whoa, is that an Italian import? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What is that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's using proper Italian caramel sauce. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Caramel popcorn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Isn't caramel just sugar? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's literally just fried sugar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like, I won't lie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> One thing as I've said in the past before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> with the movie theaters. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have been very impressed
with popcorn in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They have really taken popcorn. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not a huge fan of
popcorn, but lemme try. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly, Japanese
popcorn, if you come here, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's fucking good, yeah? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You think popcorn is
like, an American staple, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's good shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually like that,
that's not too sweet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is just popcorn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't really care about popcorn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Go to a movie theater in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Make sure you get popcorn. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Get the half and half. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> You won't be disappointed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The thing about popcorn to me is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm never the one to buy popcorn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I'll always take
it if someone's got it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm always that guy.
- Like I never go out of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> my way to be like, okay,
I am craving popcorn now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need popcorn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm more just the guy who's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> okay, there's popcorn? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean I'm gonna take some. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If it's there, but I'm never gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> go out of my way.
- Like I'll never order </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> my own popcorn at a theater, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but if someone has popcorn, I'm taking it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If I'm offered I'm not gonna say no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just read what this is called. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the most unappetizing name </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've ever heard in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Go on.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sugar Rusk. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is the English name. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Rusk? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's actually in
Japanese as shuga rasshu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shugarasku. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Shugarasku. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you sure they didn't like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just try to spell out Sugar Rush, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and just kind of fucked it up? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm having a shugarasku! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where's the Fortnite chug jug? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wow, look at that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Let me take one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I look at this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mini baguette. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I look at this and I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this should not taste sweet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> If I bite into this and it tastes sweet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is like those like party baguettes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you put like a little bit of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> salmon on top of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, you put a little salmon, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you put a little bit of mozzarella cheese. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ooh la la. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like at a fancy house party. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (crunching) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, but it's really sweet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's literally sugar on a baguette. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's sugar on a baguette. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Nope, nope. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Nope. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's fucked up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's get that out of here.
- I'm noping, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm noping the fuck out of there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Get it the fuck out of here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is like, going against like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - everything that France fought for. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They did not have the French Revolution </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> so this could happen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's, oh god. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To help us out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Lawson's has a collaboration with, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how do you pronounce this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Godiva? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Godiva?
- Godiva? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it Godiva or Godiva? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's Godiva, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] Godiva. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No one knows?
- It's Godiva. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So they have like their own
collection of like, chocolate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It looks fucking sexy.
- Honestly any time they have, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> so Family Mart or Lawson's. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Gimme that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is it called? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's fucking curry bread. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's kare pan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that curry bread? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's curry bread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is chocolate bread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is beef curry
bread in a chocolate bun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yo crack that open,
let's give it a shot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's give it a shot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh I gotta try this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> This is gonna be a Trash Taste first here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I have literally never-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my god, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yo, show it to the camera.
- Oh my god! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pull it out.
- What is that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That looks like a donut! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It looks like curry bread, but, with, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if it's like made out of chocolate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Open up a napkin, rip that shit open. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So to explain what curry
bread is normally like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's literally, you take Japanese curry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you deep fry it in katsu, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Katsu bread, and then, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's kind of like a jelly filled donut, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> except, imagine the filling was curry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's fucking good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Normal curry bread is fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> This is not normal curry bread. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> an abomination. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm excited to, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm actually excited, 'cause I
- I'm kind of interested. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> wanna know what the fuck has gone wrong. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like how is the synergy
of chocolate and curry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna mix? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I like this, what
does it say about me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I will say for experience points. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> One of the worst combinations I've had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> was when I went to this
Wisconsin state fair, in the USA. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they were selling chocolate bacon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They would literally take bacon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and dip it in chocolate.
- That ain't it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm about to find out if
there is a worse combination </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> right now than chocolate bacon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chocolate bacon sounds fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Well chocolate curry bread? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That also sounds horrible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Alright. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay, look at that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So from the looks of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it literally looks like curry
in between chocolate bread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That smells like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just a contradiction. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's give it a bite. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's bite into it, boys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh that's fucked up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's fucked up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> That ain't right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you like that, Joey? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I kinda like it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - No! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was awful, that's awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is so awful, oh my god. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my god. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if I'm just fucked up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that just tastes
like curry bread to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No it tastes, what
are you talking about? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I legitimately can't
taste the chocolate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't taste the chocolate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> All I get is like a
weird bitter after tone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's even worse than chocolate bread </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's not even sweet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the, you can taste
the cocoa in the chocolate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you bite into
it and then you get a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mouthful of curry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the worst. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's an aftertaste that you, ugh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like legitimately can't
taste the chocolate at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You taste the cocoa though, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I bet with this one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's gonna be rich. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> This is the chocolate bread, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's their collaboration with Godiva. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh god, get that away from me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That literally felt... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To me, that just tastes
like a curry bread. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So I liked it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh ho ho.
- Oh ho! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now that
- That looks good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - is a heart attack. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That is a heart attack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in a piece of bread.
- Did you get a whiff of that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was heavy chocolate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's how chocolate should look like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Chocolate bread, yes please. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude, I get like a nosebleed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after eating one piece
of Godiva chocolate, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let alone this whole fucking bread. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The chocolate bread which actually, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looks pretty fucking good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah that looks good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That looks very good.
- But that's because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they're not being adventurous
with fucking curry bread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Look, if there's one
thing you shouldn't put </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in chocolate bread, it's curry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Here's a nice cross section. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> We've got some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> chocolate paste here.
- Oh god, that is very strong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Chocolate paste on chocolate bread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It smells like heaven. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just took a wish. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> A whiff, sorry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, that's... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Siri] Chocolate is
spelled C-H-O-C-O-L... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (stifled laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, that's really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> A little disappointed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really?
- Okay, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> No. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't like that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I really like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - The chocolate tastes very artificial. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - The chocolate tastes good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't like the bread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That tastes not as good as I, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's chewy bread as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not the fluffy bread.
- I like the chewy bread. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Chewy bread doesn't taste good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> with the chocolate they put in there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd fuck with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Joey, you fuck with anything, Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Joey's like, is that fucking weird? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd fuck with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is this seasoned vomit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I'ma try it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, I'd fuck with that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd fuck with that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm the kind of guy who's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna offend anyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So if I went to another
country and they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, this is what we eat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just vomit with seasoning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd be like, well, I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna offend anyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'll give it a shot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'd be like, it's great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you don't have to like it at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, just trying it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just trying it I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is more of an appreciation to the culture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> than anything else. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What was presented here
was a massive disappointment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from the usual kind of Godiva. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It looks like sex. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This looks like sex. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Tastes like it should
be like fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And how many calories is this bad boy? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 254 calories. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 31 grams of sugar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh carbohydrates, and 29 grams of sugar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Damn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The black sugar poop pieces
were less healthier than that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I've got here some almond cookies? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yo, okay, I'd fuck with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But in Japanese it's
called almond balls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, why do they look like that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> What's with the?
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They don't look like cookies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - They look like bonbons. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah they look like
fucking bonbons, don't they? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay let's... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do fuck with anything
that has almonds in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm just getting so full. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Almonds are easily my
favorite kind of nut. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh that's kind of nice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, almond is a good nut. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Almond is like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Top tier. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - One of the top tier nuts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - S-tier nut. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - If we were gonna like, tier
the nuts, almonds up there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Alright let's give it a shot boys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Whoa. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's got this, covered in powder sugar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I thought, I don't know why I thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was gonna be soft on the inside. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It wasn't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just shortbread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know what this tastes like? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It tastes like something
you'd buy in Hawaii. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, very like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - But why Hawaii? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It tastes like
somewhere you'd go to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a food festival. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And they're like, here's
our new weird thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We mash up almonds, put them in a bowl, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and put sugar on them, it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, yeah, sure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, it tastes very like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like tropical. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's good.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's good, but like, why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Just eat an almond, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just tastes like shortbread </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> with a bit of almond in there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's true, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Bang on, that's spot on, actually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah it's shortbread with almond </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and some frosting inside. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think that's literally,
- Wanna try, Meilyne? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You literally just
described what it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just described it as a whole. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean that's, you know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm not gonna go and
buy that, but I'll eat it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now we are getting to the point where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you might recognize some of these brands. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So I've got here some Kit-Kat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is that sweet potato? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is this flavor?
- That's sweet potato, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's beni imo, which is
like red potato, I think? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's called taro in English. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You always-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just sweet potato, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is sweet potato Kit-Kat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Whenever you see this
paste or this color, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's always sweet potato,
I've learned in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They love it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They put it on everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, sweet potato
kinda slaps, but... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whoa. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whew, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whoa. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay it's like wafer. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah it's good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would eat that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't go wrong
with a Kit-Kat I find. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like this is just a Kit-Kat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No I mean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's literally just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they took a Kit-Kat
and they went (grunts). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would say that tastes
better than a Kit-Kat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd prefer that over a regular Kit-Kat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would say. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is that one or one bag? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - One bag. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was gonna say. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - 244 calories for one ball? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, oh my god.
- Holy shit! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm gonna go to the toilet right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - All three of us would've
had a heart attack. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my god, I was getting scared there, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, why does this taste so good? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Alright, I got, I've
never seen these before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ahh.
- Ahh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Some fancy shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Smokey Pretz. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, Pretz, this is smoked
potato butter flavored. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Smoked potato butter! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Smoked potato butter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pretz are just like basically... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Savory Pocky. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, (babbles) I'm
losing words right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Savory Pocky. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I prefer Pretz over Pocky, personally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean they're savory. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you go to the supermarket, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you'll see that flavor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and you'll always see the pizza flavor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which they have.
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So they have pizza flavored sticks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Just eat a fucking pizza. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just eat a pizza. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pizza shouldn't be a flavor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause there's different flavors of pizza, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so what is pizza flavor? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I quite like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hate that I like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can never go wrong
with Pretz, honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> If you're looking for a savory snack, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Pretz is the way to go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh that aftertaste is gross. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm getting really bad
aftertaste from that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's this flavor again? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Smokey potato butter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can taste the smokiness of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can taste the butter as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh Jesus, that's awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Another one from Natural Lawson, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so there are two types of Lawsons. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm getting very full, gentlemen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We're nearly done, we're nearly done. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There is the Natural Lawson's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which tends to have more
healthy options, healthy snacks, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> healthy meals. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's actually pretty good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's a pretty cool marketing strategy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so they have their own brand of stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and this is their cranberry
cookies with GABA. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cranberry cookies?
- GABA? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - GABA it says. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Isn't GABA like the stuff
they put in energy drinks? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah it is isn't it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Kuranberi kuki. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Is what it says in Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Very good Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Nihongo Jouzu! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was looking for GABA. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, where's GABA? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's literally at the top, it says GABA. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - GABA. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You wanna point it at the camera? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They literally spell GABA in English. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're just like fuck it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just gave up on learning the language. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Meilyne] It's enriched chocolate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Enriched chocolate? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what GABA is? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It has aminobutyric acid? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Aminobutyric acid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] I know exactly what that is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is supposed to be healthy, so, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what is it, like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah so the stuff at Natural Lawson </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is way more healthy, so
it should be healthier. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - So, one of these is,
is that a one, one bag? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> 65 calories, is that right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 17.5 grams.
- Oh that's nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh that might be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll just give it a shot anyway. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You can tell me Joey, I'll hand it to you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There you go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Thank you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Ooh, this looks like a diet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> This looks like a diet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like a belVita? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, this looks like a diet snack. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It looks like a diet bar honestly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - How many calories, is it
bag, or like, what is it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it's per meal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meal?
- Meal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is 17 and a half grams. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, this is 35 grams, so, okay, so, two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - So this is 100. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So half a bag is 65 calories. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - For what looks to be
like a very heavy snack. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's have a taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's literally like a belVita. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is a belVita. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's a belVita? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the diet like, cookies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or diet biscuits with like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they have them in every country. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - This tastes something like
my grandma would've had. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like grandma, can I have some snacks? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And she's like here you go. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's not actually, I quite like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's nice.
- I like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually, if I had a
Natural Lawson's closer to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd probably get that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's actually, fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cranberry flavored stuff
is actually really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah I'm taking that home with me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Put it in a little Ziploc bag. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Fantastic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Should we talk about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of the stuff at the front here? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, yeah, I wanna talk about this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I already like these. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> These are the ramune flavored... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Candy? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Candy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have an ancient video on my channel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> from like six years
ago where I bought like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a box of those candy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I said to myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> would I be able to change
ramune candy back to ramune? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This ancient video on my channel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's still up there.
- What is this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a Vsauce video? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So what I did was I
emptied out like 30 of these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] No don't put it on the table, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'll get grease on there.
- into a ball. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, oh god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I emptied like 30 of these into a ball, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I crushed them into a powder, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I mixed it with carbonated water, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to see if it would go back into a ramune. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Spoilers! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It doesn't go back into a ramune. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I only ever had the drink a few times. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's quite nice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ramune is basically what, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how would you describe ramune? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's basically like Japanese lemonade? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, Japanese lemonade. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I love these. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You love this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude I grew up with this shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is like eating a kid's cereal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I eat this, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I taste a childhood I never had. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No wonder you don't like tengone, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because you're fucking eating
kid's shit all the time! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What, were you drinking like
breast milk still all the time? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> What's going on? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a secret.
- I would eat this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What Connor has right there, Choco-babies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I love these. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - These are great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - These are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> these are terrible though, 'cause like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you think you're not
eating a lot of chocolate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's so fucking dense. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I look at this and I thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was gonna be a Tic-Tac. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The first time I tried
it I thought it was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it looks like a Tic-Tac. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you bite into it and it's just. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like--
- It's pure chocolate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pure chocolate is rare though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the most inoffensive
chocolate that it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the good chocolate
you would eat as a kid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Gimme gimme. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> You're opening it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a tag at the bottom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was a tag, it
doesn't matter, I did it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You did it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, literally just,
Tic Tac chocolate version. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It makes chocolate way too easy to eat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because you just. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The supermarkets have the big versions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And if I get them, it's almost impossible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not to eat it in one day.
- 'Cause it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like eating sprinklings. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh that's my childhood
right there, lads. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like this big as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tiny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's my childhood right there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's really nice milk chocolate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Mmm. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That's good shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The other thing though
that is my childhood, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is these things, Umaibo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh I hate these. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> These suck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you tried these? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah, you can try it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - So these. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> They're literally called Umaibo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which means tasty stick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's literally what it's called. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's basically, oh god, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how do you even explain it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So basically there's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these have been around
since like the fucking 20's. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> These are ancient. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they're 10 yen each. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Alright? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fucking nothing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But feel how light that is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - These are the Space Raiders. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> These are the Space
Raiders of Japan I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is packaged air. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you throw this high
enough into the air, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it'll just go off to the stratosphere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - This has no weight at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's the actual weight
written on the package? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Six grams. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Six grams. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Six grams, but I guarantee-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm pretty sure most of the grams </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the packaging.
- Is the packaging. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is the fucking packaging, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm literally holding air here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I have the corn potage flavored. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is like corn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude this just looks like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> these just look like Monster's crisps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh mine's, I got the cheese one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You should try it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is this flavor? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is the mentaiko
flavor, the cod roe flavor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is just Monster's crisps, isn't it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No it's like Monster's crisps </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if they were made by Space Raiders. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you have Space Raiders in Australia? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've heard of those, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Alright, let's try it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (crunching) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a big Wotsit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It takes away all the
moisture in your mouth though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, It's a Monster's crisp. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just a Wotsit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's a big Wotsit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This isn't cheese, it's just a Wotsit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can understand why
that was your childhood. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Americans, this is a Cheeto. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what this is.
- I honestly, dude, imagine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like a five year old, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're given like 100 yen
of like, just, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> pocket money from your
grandma or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Of course you're buying 10 of these. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm buying 10 of these. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like these motherfuckers are
gonna fill me up until dinner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, who doesn't love fucking Wotsits </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> or Monster's crisps or whatever? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just cheese sticks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh chikama, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can guarantee though, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that these are probably not
the best tasting cheese. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look, I also grew up with these, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but after about age eight,
I stopped eating them, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I had proper cheese in Australia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When you have real
cheese, you can't eat this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But if you're American, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and not from Wisconsin.
- But this is not just cheese, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> this is cheese with
kamaboko, which is fish cake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (sighs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You shouldn't have said that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you should've let him try it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just give it a go. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wanna try it, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're on the show, you
can't say no any more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't say no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> really fucking full.
- Look at that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - What the fuck?
- What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Kamachi, kama. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How the hell do I describe.
- I've never had one of these. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - How do you eat these, Joey? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm gonna be honest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> This is probably the least
appetizing looking thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that we've had on today. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ugh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You kinda just rip it open like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - We've had some pretty gross shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but this looks vile. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This actually looks disgusting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - This looks like on the same level as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> squirty cheese, almost.
- What's the ratio of cheese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to like, fish? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't wanna smell them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How do I open this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This immediately, just
like, grab the top and just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> down like a banana. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> These boys are strong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Here, I'll open them up
for you, there you go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let me get this one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - There you go, just get a knife. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fucking hell.
- Oh okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fort Knox should be... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - This actually tastes,
this actually smells </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> close to vomit, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> As close to vomit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as you can--
- It's like cheesy vomit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> isn't it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Alright, I'm gonna have one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I haven't had these. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Smell it, smell it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I haven't had one of these
since I was about eight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, is this gonna
be cheese flavored vomit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I imagine it to be? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It tastes exactly how I remember it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Boomer tries Japanese
snack for first time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly it doesn't taste
as bad as I thought it would. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It tastes like you're eating plastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It tastes like you're eating plastic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you get the fish aftertaste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where is the cheese in that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't taste any fucking cheese. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was not cheese, that was plastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a plastic fish sausage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's fish flavored plastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have a Melty Kiss, as they're called. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Meruti Kissu! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Meruti Kissu, as they
say in all the commercials. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I don't particularly like these. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] You don't? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just, mochi, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Am I eating mochi, kind of? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like mochi with
like chocolate on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's give it a shot, shall we? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're not a fan of mochi? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Mochi's hit or miss for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Of course, because it's Japan, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> they're individually packaged. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Love the packaging. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Say what you will. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's fucking pretty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like the box makes you wanna get it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - The thing about Melty Kiss </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> is Melty Kiss is one of
those brands in Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that is always seasonal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They always have a seasonal
flavor of Melty Kiss. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You can tell what time period you are in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you go to a supermarket or a konbini, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you see what Melty
Kisses are on for sale. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And as the name suggests, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they melt pretty fucking fast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I really like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mmm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is just basically
mochi, with chocolate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Mm. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's just basically-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd fuck with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Actually you know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know what Melty Kiss you have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I had an awful like tasting one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is just chocolate,
this is fucking good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is chocolate truffle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is really rich chocolate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just chocolate truffle, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's no mochi in this is there? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is there?
- I think so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There might be a mochi variant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh I thought it was mochi. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> So I tasted that, I
didn't taste any mochi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a truffle, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah that's just chocolate truffle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that's just truffle butter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with chocolate.
- I'd fuck with that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and thank god they're
all individually wrapped </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so we can enjoy those later. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I also have, this is mochi though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the mochi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's mochi.
- There you go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Mochi, mochi... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my god, I can't read fucking the font. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Come on, you're Nihongo Jouzu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> You can do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shi-yo-ra? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Shiyora? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Shiora. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Shiora? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shoyura?
- So cute just trying to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for them trying to figure it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bro, it's the fancy fonts
fuck me up in Japanese so much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's shokora. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh that's ko! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That looks like a yu doesn't it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought that was yu as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yu would be, yu, the
bottom would be more... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, I thought it was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's got a little bit there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember the yu, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it looks like an iron.
- That's fancy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Looks like an iron! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's how I remember the
yu, it looks like an iron! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's cute. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's separated into
cute little packages. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh cute.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude, that's like perfect for dates. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You and your GF, rocking
out with the mochi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, how do you feel about mochi? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Mid tier. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It depends. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It depends on the type. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like mochi ice cream
and like regular mochi. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And like sweet mochis is
like completely different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in my opinion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And so what is mochi again? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mochi is just rice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's rice pudding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah so, mochi's just rice pudding. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So basically they grab mochi rice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is a specific type of rice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And they just fucking
mash it with a hammer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> until it turns into mochi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's very chewy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is good shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's clean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mm. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How I always feel about mochi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that it's just very inoffensive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would never not eat mochi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I would never go out
my way to get it as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you know like a
lot of old people die </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> from choking on mochi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can see why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So when you're eating mochi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> make sure you like--
- Shit fights back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Make sure you like,
properly chew this shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> otherwise it will get
stuck in your throat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm sorry I'm just laughing 'cause I saw </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one of Garnt's item, I keep
forgetting it's called this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's called the chocolate pound cake. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> For some reason that feels so, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that has such a sexual energy to it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is like, I never
thought about that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, yeah, poundo cake, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But when you say it in
English, it's really weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the chocolate pound cake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Chocolate pound cake. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yo girl, you wanna get
some chocolate pound cake? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah see? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> That has like, I've never had a food item </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that has raw sexual energy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But that has it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ay yo shawty! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Y'all want a chocolate pound cake? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What that pound cake do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean it's just cake. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's just a fat block of chocolate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah I'll fuck with that, gimme that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know what this tastes like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah I know what this tastes like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When Garnt has run out of energy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> He'll run into the 7-11
or like, Family Mart, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and just buy one of
these and just devour it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I don't know how
you do that to be honest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sometimes I just need a sugar rush. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just a brownie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That literally just tastes
like a brownie, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's good though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it's just a brownie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't need to describe that taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's way more sexually
sounding than a brownie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> The pound cake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pound cake does sound
better than brownie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hold up the camera. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> That's nice, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's sexy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hmm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Alright, I think we are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> almost done, right?
- Joey, what'd you have? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've got these like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> chocolate pies.
- Pain de chocolat? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Choco pie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh god no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That looks fucking awful.
- That just looks like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a pain de chocolat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but like not as good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - France is crying right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't really fuck
with these to be honest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm gonna be honest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't need to try that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't need to try that.
- Let's not open that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's open the stuff
that is like, only... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is that, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What the fuck is that Kit-Kat? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is a melon Kit-Kat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're kidding me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Melon Kit-Kat? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They have, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a Hokkaido melon Kit-Kat, too, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the good melons. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - See the thing about Hokkaido melons </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is that it is expensive as fuck here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause apparently it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> tastes fucking super amazing.
- Open that bitch up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hokkaido melons, for reference is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of like, maybe about that big. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But a regular thing will
cost you like two, $300. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like the top class of melon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh this is the ball variety
that we tried before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is this just gonna
taste like Kit-Kat again? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Whoa. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd fuck with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love melon flavored shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Holy shit that's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's really good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That might be one of
the best ones I've tried. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Hey, gimme some of that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's probably the best Kit-Kat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I've ever had in my life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What the fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That has such a clean flavor to it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That straight up tastes
like you're eating a melon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> That's crazy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, the crunchiness
of a biscuit and a Kit-Kat, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> but with the clean taste of a fruit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know how you bite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> into a melon, and it just--
- Fuck, Kit-Kat, goddamn. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know how you bite into
a melon and it just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it feels like clean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it feels like you're eating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a really watery fruit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> For some reason that was
a completely dry snack </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we just had, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it felt watery.
- But it felt watery, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - What the fuck is this
Sugar Butter Sand Tree? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - We don't need to try that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's called Sugar Butter Sand Tree. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck is that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It just looks like a custard cream. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh it's a 7-11 brand too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh fuck that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Wasabi sticks, it looks like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is that cheese and wasabi? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh that's Jagariko, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> which is like a brand
of like, savory sticks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And I guess this is wasabi shoyu flavored. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you like wasabi snacks? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I do not get them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like the wasabi like, beans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The wasabi seed, like flavored things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I forgot what they were called, but like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know what you're talking about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like the peanut
and the like, wasabi food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's like beans that
are covered in wasabi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I fuck with those. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let me smell this bad boy.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> For me, wasabi just doesn't feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like something that should be snacked on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (crunching) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's basic as fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did you taste anything? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't taste anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I taste the wasabi, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I barely, oh a little bit, tiny bit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, there it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because when we eat
something wasabi flavored, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're used to the whole
like, kickback, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But this is just like, literally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just a hint of wasabi flavor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not too overpowering, I like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I literally was just
shitting on wasabi snacks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> literally five minutes ago </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's because the wasabi, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> normally what happens
with wasabi snacks is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it overpowers whatever you're eating. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I can probably taste the soy sauce </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in that as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I ate that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, I can't
even taste the wasabi, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but then, you get that aftertaste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You literally just did
like the kombucha girl like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mm-hmm? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, ew, wasabi, actually, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> these are pretty good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah because, you know
when you have bad sushi, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you kind of like try
to overpower it with wasabi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just to get rid of the taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of the bad sushi.
- No, I don't do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Who does that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - But like, I don't find myself </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in a bad sushi restaurant. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know a good one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Joey was Louie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> He didn't go into a bad sushi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't go to that
100 yen bullshit sushi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You go to some sushi restaurants, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially with friends from abroad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and you see them like, put
a little bit of soy sauce, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then fucking wasabi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it's like 90%
wasabi, 10% soy sauce, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and they just basically
just dip the entire </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sushi in the wasabi.
- [Joey] And they drown it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in that shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They fucking drown it in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I don't know how
they can taste the fish. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the incorrect way to eat sushi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Finally, oh go ahead. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I feel like this is
the perfect kind of balance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> of like, how a good
sushi should taste like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I really like those actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Damn, when's the Gigguk
video coming out about these? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> You went on a fucking rant there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> about how beautiful they were. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, final thing we have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the classic.
- Matcha. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Matcha. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We could've had about
a bazillion matcha items </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> we wanted to I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, I think matcha
is my favorite kind of snack. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Weren't you the guy
like seven months ago </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who thought matcha was overrated? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I don't think that was Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That wasn't Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought it was Garnt.
- It was someone else. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the thing.
- I think matcha's overhyped. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just saying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel that's like the-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so you're the guy who
thinks matcha's overhyped. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think matcha's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> also overhyped.
- I feel there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the two dichotomies with matcha though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's either you think it's
fucking amazing with everything, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or you think it's overrated as fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's too much matcha stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean in the last podcast we recorded, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I had a matcha latte. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Take a stick there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - To me matcha is kind of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes I'll eat one, sometimes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like handing a
cigarette over isn't it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Alright, let's fucking try it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Gentlemen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've had these before, these are great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, these are great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Matcha snacks are great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'd rather a chocolate based thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly have you, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> One question. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you ever had matcha soft serve? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause matcha soft serve
- I quite like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to be fair. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - is literally the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> single handedly changed
my opinion of matcha. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause after I had matcha soft serve, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, matcha tastes fucking great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh we have more, sorry, I forgot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We have this thing which
is, go-ha-na desu yo? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nihongo Jouzu. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Gohandesuyo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Gohandesuyo which is
basically this like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even know what
the flavor of it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just Gohandesuyo flavored. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But basically you--
- Can I smell it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You put it on a bed of rice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it basically, it's good on rice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's all it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bruh, you're kidding me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can I smell that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That smells like seaweed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] It's seaweed paste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a seaweed paste.
- It's a seaweed paste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You would give this to like, kids. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think I inhaled an X amount of salt </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just from being near that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well that's the thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it's so salty, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you put that on a bed of rice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it mellows it out perfectly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is, I'm not gonna eat that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not eating that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is Jaga Choco. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's just potato chips, it looks like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - With chocolate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just chocolate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Chocolate potato chips. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Looks like it hasn't been, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what, fuck it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can make assumptions all day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> As the great lord says, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> let's just jump right into it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, that's...
- A little... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, I think I've
tried these before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Looking a little anemic, dare I say. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean it's literally just
a chocolate potato chip. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Will it be salty though? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's what I'm curious about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They are weirdly salty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You can't taste the chocolate,
there's too much salt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm having a kombucha
tea moment right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (snickering) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, mm, mm? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a little too much salt for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A little too much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know what that tastes like? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It tastes like you ate a bag of crisps, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you instantly downed
it with like a hot chocolate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - If I'm gonna </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what that tastes like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - get double calories of
eating crisps and chocolate, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wanna enjoy both, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't wanna like, have one, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and then just eat calories
for no fucking reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I gotta cleanse my palate with this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is that one thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have over there, Joey?
- I'm having like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an existential moment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's that polar bear thing you have? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's basically, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> what the fuck this this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Konayuki Shokora. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's basically Melty Kiss I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is it really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's kind of the same thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Crack it open, let's try it out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a brownie I
guess, let's try it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is giving me an
existential crisis right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Garnt, just keep eating it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, they're big. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Whoa. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Look at the packaging it comes in dude, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's fancy as fuck,
- Whoa. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> What is that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's crack it open though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Garnt, are you okay? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I'm not okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not good Garnt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Why are we deciding if it's good or not? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because it tastes good,
and then it doesn't, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then it does, and then it doesn't, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then it, ugh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm so fucking confused. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, yeah, again,
it's like a Melty Kiss, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but kind of more fancy looking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just wanna grab one.
- Just grab one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just pop it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> There we are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like a mini brownie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whoa. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh it's not like a mini brownie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh it's like if snow was chocolate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh actually it says
powder snow chocolate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There you go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The branding on point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Man that's so rich. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - That instantly melts away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Holy fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] You wanna try that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hold on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You still having an
existential crisis with that one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I like this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It took me three bites. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - After much deliberation, lads. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't hear whatever
you guys were talking about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I was--
- Guys, he likes it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was just trying to figure out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if this was a taste that I like, and, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this tastes pretty good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - He was like having like
an ancient Greek like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> philosophy like Aristotle
moment in his head </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> while we were eating this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So what is it that you're talking about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> What is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is powder snow chocolate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It literally just melts away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That is (mumbling). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This man can't make
up his mind on anything! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This honestly has fucked me up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I'm just like,
do I like things now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What do I like any more? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> What is life? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - (burps) Oh god, I feel sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't eat chocolate, but this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> more chocolate than I've had in so long. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember how we were debating
if we were gonna have dinner </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> after filming this episode? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That ain't happening. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - We are not having
dinner after this episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just enjoy the atmosphere
of having a dinner together. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I didn't get that atmosphere. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is not a dinner with the boys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> You literally just witnessed three people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have dinner together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Over two hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah for two hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - A literal konbini dinner. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So lads, like, what would
you say is your favorite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess, item from each genre of food? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - So are we starting
with the hot foods first? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so hot foods, which one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which one reigns supreme in the hot foods? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, hot food, I'm
still stanning Seven. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Seven, if you want a meal.
- Lawson fried chicken. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Lawson fried chicken man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Seven fried chicken. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Seven beef bowl. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Seven any hot food tastes great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly, I think Lawson have been doing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the hot food better, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Gotta be real with you man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I'm gonna be the mediator, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I would have to just give it to Seven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes!
- You fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> are you for real? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd have to just give it to Seven </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> for the hot food.
- You're not a clown, Joey, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're the whole circus. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Again, I don't eat the fried food, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> so I don't fucking care. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> All we know is that Family
Mart fried food sucks arse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I never get the fried
food from the konbini </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I'm just like, if I'm gonna... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I'm gonna have fried food, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna go to a fucking restaurant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, if I'm gonna fuck up my body, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'ma do it in a good place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pay good money to fuck up your body. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I want the best shit if this
is like my cheat day, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> What are the best like, sandwiches, then? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, sandwich. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Probably Lawson's. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Have I converted you into seeing the way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of the tuna sandwich from Lawson's? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look, the tuna sandwich, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Lawson is definitely better. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But the egg sandwich,
Family Mart's better. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - If only they could join forces. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I would agree with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - If only they could join forces. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like runny egg sandwiches </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> should never be a thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not runny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ooh, I don't know about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a paste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's mashed up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the collab we want to happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Japan, we're waiting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like egg paste shouldn't be a thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not paste, it's just mashed down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna taste the egg slices. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want the texture of the egg. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't need it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I need it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would prefer it, but. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Even scrambled egg has a texture. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> This was like, scrambled egg
that was put into a paste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It is... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like egg flavored glue. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what it tastes like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To me, the egg is like,
they're both very strong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But to me the tuna is just so much better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The tuna is hands down better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, why would I want it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And also, like, there's
supermarkets that like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> aren't any of those that get like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the sandwiches as well,
and the tuna always tastes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the Family Mart one for some reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - For some reason just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Lawson's tuna.
- I feel the Lawson one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> they actually took like the canned tuna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just put it in.
- Yeah, it's good shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's good fucking shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like the Lawson's one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the tuna sandwich is
better, definitely better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> The egg sandwiches from Family
Mart were definitely better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't eat that many
sandwiches from the konbinis, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I don't really have too
much of a strong opinion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm so full. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What about the onigiri, the rice balls? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Lawson's. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Lawson's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, Lawson's hands down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Lawson's hands down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Of a sample size of one type. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I did not realize though, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that because we saw two Seven onigiris, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if one will
make it to the final cut, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but we opened up two. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They both looked as
depressing as each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> My god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - They're pretty sad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The Lawson one was clean. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It was nicely wrapped around.
- That was an art piece </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And the fillings were
in every single bite. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> No matter where I bite, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I need to get a bit of filling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Lawson's hit it on the mark. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Lawson's definitely
by far the best onigiri. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Thank you guys, thank you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Appreciate the love. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What about the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what else did we cover? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess snacks? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - We had like the like,
fish snacks, meat snacks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean the fish snacks and meat snacks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I think we can all agree
are all pretty mid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're all like the same level. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know I liked the fish crisps. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh the Lawson fish crisps. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah yeah.
- Yeah yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think the way that
Lawson's do the squid as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is really fucking good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We unfortunately didn't
get to try any like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> dried squid or dried
fish or something, but, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's something that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of people from, you
know, America and England </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that I've met have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I bring this shit
from Thailand to England, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and people are like, why
are you eating fish food? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it kinda does smell
a bit like fish food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A little bit, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It does, but it tastes fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the perfect amount of salty, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's perfect to go with your beer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fish snacks just, you can't like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you don't know the full
enjoyment of fish snacks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> until you've had a cold
beer with them I feel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, you gotta have a beer with them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I must say, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm thoroughly impressed
with the One Cup, personally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought I was gonna fucking hate this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I finished it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm impressed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm impressed, I thought
it was gonna taste like shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it tasted, not great, but drinkable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Way better than Chris's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would buy another one of this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck, did
Chris just bring us like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like the budget, yeah.
- Expired sake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - The worst one he could find? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - He just like pissed in a bottle, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> was like, yeah, it's sake, trust me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So potent that it had alcohol in it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My favorite snack I think has gotta be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the Kit-Kat, watermelon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah the Kit-Kat watermelon.
- The melon Kit-Kat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You mean the melon? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just the rock melon, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The Kit-Kat melon, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The melon Kit-Kat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I also really like these though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I liked them, but I
think the Kit-Kat melon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was just above the rest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like--
- All the breads </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> disappointed me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the breads were kinda mid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No it's not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Lemme just-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Choco babies, Garnt,
get the fuck out of here! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and again, like,
you know, like the ramune </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and stuff like that, the choco baby, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the stuff that I grew up with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That shit's great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I'm so full.
- What, you having another </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> existential crisis right now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck, I took a bite,
and I was just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this tastes awful, and then I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no this tastes good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You gotta fucking try
this, please try this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You don't have to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've got it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The initial taste tastes fucking awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then the aftertaste
kicks in and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this tastes like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the aftertaste gives me
the same kind of taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> When you're cooking like
a brownie or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you have like cooking chocolate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're cooking like
a chocolate pudding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then as a kid you kinda just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have a bit of the chocolate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It doesn't taste like that.
- You scoop a bit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into your mouth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not gonna like, I wasn't listening, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just enjoying Connor
looking dead over there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It doesn't taste like
that, you're chatting shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But all in all, I'd
have to say, you can get. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like this is not even.
- You're a winner </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause you get to have all of this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is not even a corner </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of what you can get at a konbini. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck the best tasting thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> What was the worst tasting thing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh god. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I'm having a hard
time deciding between this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, honestly? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> The crab cake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The crab cake was the worst. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, the crab cake was pretty bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Crab cake was the worst. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, actually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's this for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> This has a worse
aftertaste than crab cake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I still have the aftertaste of this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in my mouth right now
after eating all that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shit was gross. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean, again.
- Oh god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I grew up with chikama </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's a reason
why I stopped eating it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause it's gross.
- That ain't right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] It ain't right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It literally smells like vomit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it ain't right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It literally smells like vomit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was probably
the worst flavored one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was the worst thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But yeah, again, this is nowhere near </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the variety that you can get
at a convenience store, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, there's so many more
snacks, I mean, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Haven't even talked about
the fact that you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can buy basically fucking anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at a convenience store, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You can pay your utility bills. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You can send packages.
- You can pay your rent </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at a konbini. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah you can send packages. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You can send packages. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You can get toiletries.
- What can't you do? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can get, you know, like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Lawson's next to me has now basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> just has a whole section
for like household items. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like you can buy like bedsheets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like soap containers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like, weird shit that you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why do I need this here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like a mini Ikea in Lawson's. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's so strange. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> But really cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can buy stuff like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you can buy technical stuff like SD cards </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and USB sticks as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like chargers and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Deodorant. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've bought underwear
from Family Mart before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have a pair of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> honestly the best pair of
socks I've bought in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> are from Lawson's. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - From Lawson's! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They're really fucking... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have gloves. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like hand gloves that I
bought from Family Mart </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I still wear them to this day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So super super convenient. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So like, definitely
when you come to Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever the world opens up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let us know what your favorite is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, let us know what your favorite is! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It might be neither of
our favorite, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> It could be Ministop, it
could be Yamazaki, who knows? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And let Chris Broad
know that his shit taste </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> thinking that Family
Mart chicken is the best. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Family Mart chicken is not the best. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the real loser here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Family Mart chicken sucks.
- The real loser is the fact </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that Chris thinks that Family
Mart chicken tastes good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Please, if you come to Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Please go to Family Mart Chicken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Family Mart, get the
chicken, and just, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
