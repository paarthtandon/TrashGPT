<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, "Well, why the
fuck do we have a blowtorch? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Why don't we have something
like a normal lighter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or something.
- Like a match, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and he went to go point it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to start a fire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and the whole blowtorch just went on fire. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Uh, you
might wanna put that out." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (bright upbeat music) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hello and welcome to another
episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I am your host for today, Garnt, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and with me once again are the boys, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we almost died! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not clickbait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not clickbait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the title of this video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That is the title of this video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We almost died camping, guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, now we have to do it like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why did you say it so quickly? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Now no one's gonna watch
the rest of the episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now we have to do like
the YouTuber thumbnail face </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of just... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, this is my 'nail face. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey gasps) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Audio-only listeners are
like, "What's happening?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How long did it take you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to perfect the YouTuber thumbnail face? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt, come on we can't tangent already. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We've only just started the topic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This isn't a Quentin
Tarantino film, Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no. Okay. That's the hook. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We'll start off with a tangent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then we'll go back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the topic of this video.
- We'll talk about that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but in the meantime... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But in the meantime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> how long did it take you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to perfect your YouTuber thumbnail face? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're asking the wrong question, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's how long did it take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before you stopped becoming
ashamed of yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing the YouTuber thumbnail face? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How long has it been
since your soul died? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, this is a legitimate question </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I still suck
at it, because I do... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you mean? You
just open your mouth big. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] I do anime thumbnails, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so my entire career
has been anime thumbnails, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so the few videos that
I film in live action, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've just been like a fucking
sheep in headlights about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your YouTube face is like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - My YouTube face is
just me looking depressed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I don't know how
to make any other face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] To be fair, you do it very well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember I got an angry email once </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from someone being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Why do you make your thumbnails </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> look like they're for 10-year-olds?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Why is your face open
and gasping like an idiot? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you have a penis in your
mouth or something like that?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they were like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because the general demographic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is a 10-year-old on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I was thinking, and
then the explanation is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately, "You
guys won't click on it!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The sad truth is that it works </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's something that you
have to come to terms with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Someone asked me, "When you
take the thumbnail thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> do you just depressingly sigh afterwards, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> after you make the pose?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "Yes." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, absolutely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, I gotta massage the face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's no bigger "Black Mirror" moment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> than when you finish shooting
that thumbnail face shot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, okay, well now I
gotta go on with my life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> knowing I just did that." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it is depressing as fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, to me, I just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because with thumbnails, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like you never
perfect it on the first go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like with
thumbnails you need 15 goes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> before you know what your
thumbnail style is, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sounds like a rookie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> For you, it's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One-take wonder, baby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For you, it's fucking easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - One take, no re-dos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause now you've got
cartoony thumbnails, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's 50-50. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's when I'm too lazy
and then I get them to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But also there's some
thumbnails where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I can't possibly do a good
enough job capturing this." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'll do some nice
little cheesy clickbait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> with a character and some drawings. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, what about you, Joey? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How long do you take on your thumbnails? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you make a specific face for that video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or is it just a random screenshot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> from the video you just filmed? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you think you make
the best thumbnails </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> out of Trash Taste? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who do you think makes
the best thumbnails? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You think so? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who's got the most views? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Different topics, though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I definitely make the
worst; that's for sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, do you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think 'cause you make them (laughs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think my thumbnails fucking suck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like mine a lot. I
like mine. I think I... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I like yours as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I get criticized the
consistency isn't there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't have a pattern, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I also like that it's all
over the place a little bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like that you get a different art style </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every now and then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] For me, I feel-
- I feel it's a bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of a double-edged sword
if you develop a pattern </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because then your thumbnails
start to look same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah.
- But that's the good thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because actually, if you imagine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you go, you've discovered
a YouTuber, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One of the biggest things
that puts me off is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've discovered a YouTuber,
his content's amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I click on their channel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's all over the fucking place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, "What
is this channel trying to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what is this channel's content?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's kind of like an
Instagram page, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's not just about one photo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's about when people
click on your entire profile </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they see a portrait of
what your profile's about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Again, a perfect example
of why my thumbnails suck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause they're all over the place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay first of all-
- [Garnt] No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Now I look like an
egoistical asshole, being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I think mine are the best." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I do like mine though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's 'cause I spend a
lot of fucking time doing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I have a bunch of people I consult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're like the council getting around it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, "What do you think?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wait, why do you think the
reason your thumbnail... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, I have several
questions I wanna ask you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't expect you to be
like, "My thumbnails suck." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Why would you upload them
if you think they suck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I can't make better ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why don't you hire someone? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the same thing with editing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I could do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, "I'm not
good enough at this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Someone else can take my
jumbled mess of words. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I can work with them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They can get used to my style
and then we can go about it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then I feel it just completely detaches me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> from my content, in a sense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's an excuse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the thumbnail is
the last little bit of me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I can put into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are the video, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you are the video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is true but- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause your thumbnail style is you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's your face. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That is part of your style.
- I think it's also because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even know what the fuck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm doing with my thumbnails. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't have a pattern
or anything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I also switch between the cartoon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> my avatar version of me, and my face. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But is it a 50-50 clear split? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or is it, I feel like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's mostly my face nowadays. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's mostly your face now, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it the avatar when you, 'cause- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Before, it used to be just my avatar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I understand, because one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's easier to rely on an avatar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You have a lot more room to play with, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and the expressions are
set and it's cleaner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - With your face, you
gotta worry about lighting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You gotta worry about all that stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it when you cannot get
a good one with your face, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you bring in the avatar? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I just give up
and just use a shit one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or if you're not happy with it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I see, I see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I work with what I've got, basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you need get a
good artist or somebody. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause even with my photos now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you'll notice that there's text in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All the text is hand-drawn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everything's all hand-done </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I want to get it all to fit nicely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When you fuck around with fonts, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah, you could probably do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I wanna get everything perfect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'll talk with someone about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Let's reframe this picture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's move things around." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Gotta get just right, so it looks nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because like you say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you think you have the best thumbnails, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I think you definitely do, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the content you make. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, that's why you've found success. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna suck my own dick here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like my thumbnails </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> are the most optimized they can be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for anime-style content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's true, I guess it's a different- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's a different type
of style of content, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like if I'm cosplaying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> at the time of recording, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I recently used a cosplay video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's so easy to make a good thumbnail. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just literally get the
picture of the cosplay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then just have
some, "Whoa, that's me." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- That's what I did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Whereas for me, 90% of the time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you see a video recommended on YouTube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it has, say, a waifu's face
plastered right on the front </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with a bunch of memes on the side </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're gonna know it's my videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're not even gonna need to see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's my channel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's a certain style </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I've built up over the years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can I backtrack, sucking my own dick? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We all make the best
thumbnails for what we do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're all good gamers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure somebody could
make better thumbnails </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for doing the same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But that's the thing, though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can never think, "I've
got it. I've got it nailed." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You gotta think, "How
do I make it better?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How do I improve this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna make it pop more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate thumbnails. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What is the worst thumbnail </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you think you've made, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can remember? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, so many. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you ever gone back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and changed the thumbnail, at all? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Never? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm too lazy for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Once I'm done, it's gone. That's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Once the video's live, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I do not wanna think about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I used to think like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> until I saw that fucking
Veritasium video that... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That said he goes back
and changes the thumbnail. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I tried it, and it actually
makes a fucking difference. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some videos that I changed
the thumbnail and title </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually have a second wind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're doing way better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than even when they initially launched. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've been thinking about doing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ever since that Veritasium video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but I just haven't been fucked to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love it- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, "Yeah,
I'll get to it today." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. A lot of the older videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I genuinely don't want people to watch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, "This, not the content I make. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I do not want you watching hours and hours </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of Sebastian prank calling, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then being like, 'When's
the next one coming out?'" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know? It's not. It's not coming out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's never coming out.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not doing it anymore, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let me get out of this
nightmare situation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're not gonna add anything to that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] I was just like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You looked like you were
about to say something, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was just like, "You know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think I can relate." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - In my head, I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Can I relate to this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can I relate to this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No, I can't relate to this."
- No, because most YouTubers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who can relate to this... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In my head, I was just like the avatar, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like, "That's rough, buddy." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's all I can think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Most YouTubers who get to this point... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - All I was getting in my mind was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm sorry. I'm sorry
that happened to you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But I'm not reading that,"
or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "I'm happy for you," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or "I'm sorry for your loss, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm not reading all that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because most YouTubers
who get to this point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have never had to deal with that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because that channel died. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's true, because I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the biggest things you've done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is you've definitely changed
up your content a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you definitely, your style </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and how you promote your videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and your thumbnails </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have definitely changed
along the way, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's a nice evolution, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but for me, I've been around for so long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that there are still
videos that I'm proud of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I made years ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not every video, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Anime Minutes? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Anime Minutes? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, that's definitely
coming back, eventually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can't wait for it to come back, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - When's the next one, Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like my "Hunter
x Hunter", you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just on hiatus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's your back pains. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've got back pains. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I've got Trash Taste to
work on, guys, come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you didn't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the mangaka of "Hunter × Hunter" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has back pains and hasn't
wrote in like over a year, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Hasn't released one in over a year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like two years ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Two years, Jesus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> RIP "Hunter x Hunter" fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Before that, it was like six years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now I just feel bad whenever
a manga is on hiatus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because of fucking "Berserk", </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how big of a meme that is,
and what that turned into. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw an interview with Araki. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That man works every day of the week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I bet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's like 60. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Still looks 30. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This man is never gonna stop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, of course not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This man told his weekly schedule </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and didn't mention a break anywhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> He works from, I think, 10 AM to 11 PM </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with one-hour break. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "Bruh." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Bruh." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what it takes, man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be the fucking top shonen person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But no wonder he has so
much musical reference. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> He doesn't have time to do anything else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause he's just listening
to music and drawing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and doing stuff all the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I can't imagine
what the actual life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of a mangaka is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you see some
YouTubers on the grind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But at least with YouTube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you can have some variety in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can collab and you can do... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I work them all.
- Types of content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I take breaks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, part of the
charm is that your breaks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> also happen to be monetizable, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because that's like your
Twitch streams, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because for you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's your downtime, as well as work, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess, technically, but with mangakas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't do anything but just draw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and work on your fucking series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I can't imagine being that one-tracked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and being that dedicated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to just a single thing in
your life for that long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't dedicate a month
of my life to one project, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let alone five years or
10 years or 20 years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Or your entire life, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I saw a Reddit post, it was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what's the guy who
wrote "Game of Thrones"? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - George R. R. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - George R. R. Martin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He apparently begged HBO </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to make 10 seasons of "Game of Thrones" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> instead of the seven...? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Eight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Eight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Eight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Eight? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We forgot 8th season. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I opened this thread. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I half expected, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what did you think the
comments were gonna be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you went to that thread, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what would you think people would reply? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - On what, him begging for 10 seasons? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, he apparently asked for the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They would agree with him? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They would agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, "Yeah, go, George." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah no, not at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They were like, "Well, if he wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> such a lazy piece of shit
and finished his books, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe they'd have
something to work off of." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Apparently... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - People suck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I dunno, 'cause in some ways, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> apparently, he, I can't
remember what exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But apparently, he was helping write </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some episodes initially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then later on, afterwards, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he wasn't helping write
any of the episodes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Isn't that the reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> why like the latest
seasons sucked so much? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Was that because he kind of like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe? But...
- That was the theory, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's tough- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never seen a single episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of "Game of Thrones". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We'll never know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And there was a lot of comments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's one or two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that I kind of half-agreed with, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I was like, "Okay. If
you are not gonna do the job, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you are the most
qualified person for the job, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're doing it, with or without you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you decide, 'No, I'm not doing it,' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it becomes shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can you then turn around and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Oh, it's shit. They should
have just given it more time.'" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the argument was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "If the job's gonna get done, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're not gonna do it,
then it's your fault." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's kind of his fault,
people were saying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because he should have... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not his fault, I mean... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not entirely his fault. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can understand a little bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where they were coming from. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sure there's a certain
degree of responsibility. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But to say that it's all his fault </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because he's the main guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is a little harsh, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of people were
being very critical of him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in a sense that I
thought was a bit unfair, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Game of Thrones"
fans being critical, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well I think as "Game of Thrones" fans, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they've gone through all
the five stages of grief </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with the books. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They've gotten to acceptance now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - They've accepted that
it's never gonna finish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's never coming out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm pretty sure it's over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hatahata fans are like, "First time?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm pretty sure it's never coming out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As an anime fan, I'm a hardened veteran. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Oh, this series
isn't finished? Cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Give me the next isekai. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Just give me the next finish isekai." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is the one time where
I opened a Reddit thread </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was genuinely 100% incorrect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on what I thought the
replies were gonna be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause Reddit is
normally a really simple, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first thought that comes
to your head circle jerk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, "Go for the low-hanging
fruit, get your karma." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone upvotes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But it wasn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I also find with Reddit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it also depends very much
on the board you're on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because depending on the board you're on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can get very very different replies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's all a circle jerk, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's a circle jerk of
people who think alike, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and not everyone on the
same board thinks alike, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because anyone who
doesn't just gets shunned. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You go on some Reddit threads </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or some Reddit forums
and you see this thread </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I can't be the only one
who thinks this way." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you go on the Reddit thread </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everyone, seemingly
in the Reddit thread, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thinks the exact opposite of you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you're like, "Am I the crazy one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Am I the fucking crazy one?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then you see the same thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being discussed on YouTube
or Twitter or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's a completely opposite opinion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I think it very much does depend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on what board you're on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and what group of people
you are talking to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I can't imagine
everyone would think that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that is George's fault, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was thinking about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and as somebody does creative stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously not to the same
level and same expectations, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you don't... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It sucks because there are probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a bunch of creatives out there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who are legitimately just being lazy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just chilling and not doing anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're like, "Whatever,
whatever," in making that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I guess in some ways
that raises the question of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Do the fans have a right to
demand the work come out?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If he doesn't wanna make it anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's halfway through, is that... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, the issue is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of people don't really appreciate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how much time it takes to make good shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sorry, Joey. I'm gonna do this again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna bring up "Arcane". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, once again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought you were gonna
say "Fate" there for a moment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm gonna bring up
"Arcane" once again, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Amazing, a masterpiece.
- Am I allowed to leave or? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because that series
took six years to make. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> From what I understand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it took five or six years to make. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it definitely feels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it took five or six years to make, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's so much
attention to detail </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so many different aspects of the show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I can see that this
took six years to make. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> At the same time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would I want to wait six
years for a season two? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah.
- I don't think I would. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Here's the thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno what I would rather. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Would I rather wait that
long for a better product, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or would I rather wait less time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for a decent product that
I can at least consume? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the fucking "Cyberpunk"... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fucking "Cyberpunk". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - First of all, "Arcane",
10 out of 10. Go watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Weekly reminder to go and watch "Arcane". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Number two, fuck, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's tough because... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Would you think "Cyberpunk"
would've done better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if they waited another two years? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think with a game, it's different, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because a game is normally one and done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like "Cyberpunk" would
be one and done, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It pretty much, it's over, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because they can do updates. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but like, as in
the core of the game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's not gonna be a "Cyberpunk 2". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you've played it, there's
not gonna be a "Cyberpunk 2". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If they would, I don't
know what they would do, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's gonna be like a one thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Whereas "Arcane" ended on a cliffhanger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of sorts, right?
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So when you're ending on a cliffhanger, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a different question </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as opposed to when you're
done, it's completely wrapped. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause that's why we can see reboots </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 10, 15 years later, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's like, "Okay,
it's this thing that's done." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Then, oh, 15 years later,
"You liked that thing?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Cyberpunk 2078". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, because it's done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's done, so it's fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Except it actually comes out in 2078. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it totally would.
- The year is 2077. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Cyberpunk" 2077 is finally finished. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It'll come out, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It'll will come out like a fucking patch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The patch is 10 Petrabytes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If it's a seasonal thing
with multiple seasons, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna wait six years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If it's one thing that I
don't know anything about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, I can wait 20 years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I don't give a shit about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Give me the thing that's
done and complete, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But now that we know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's probably gonna be
season two of "Arcane", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna wait six years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] I don't. I don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even if it ends up being mediocre </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> compared to season one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I am fine with it going
down from a 10 out of 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to 8 out of 10. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If it means you can get it in two years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Same here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because there's so much
potential to this story, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I feel like it
would be so squandered </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if I'm 50 and I'm still like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Waiting for Part Four of "Arcane"." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, 'cause I'm going through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the same dilemma now with "Mushoku Tensei" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because from what I've heard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> talking to people in the industry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that took so many fucking years to make, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it definitely shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it took that many years to make. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's 'cause of all
the business meetings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And that too. That too, on top of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was like 70%. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Nabi] The studio did say that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they estimate 2023 for
"Arcane" season two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 2023. That's reasonable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Nabi] It took six years
for them to learn how. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I feel like the
reason why they say six years, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they probably have
those pre-production meetings </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that last god-knows-how-many-years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> When you actually start
getting all the pieces moving, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's probably a little faster. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Now that you have more
money and more manpower, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they know that it's a success, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we know that it's very
successful, it'll you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the merchandising
is endless, probably, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> with this, and the games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we won't be having
any shortage of "Arcane". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - They'll have enough resources, I'm sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm pretty sure Riot's gonna
give them enough resources. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think one thing
that isn't appreciated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that you also need talent, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yes.
- [Joey] They do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's been enough anime projects </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that have money thrown at it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it doesn't help </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because there's just not enough talent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All the talented people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are working on different projects. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it's a dilemma. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't have the right
answer to this question. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Please be a 10 out of 10
season two, I'm begging you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm begging you. I need it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you think "Cyberpunk 2077" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should have come out when it did? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Probably not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But how long would you have waited for it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I remember when they announced </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they were delaying it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They delayed it a lot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like twice.
- People were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "King, take your time, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Take your time to do it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - First time they delayed it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's like, "You know
what, take your time." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You made "The Witcher 3". I'll allow it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Second time, that was when people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> were starting to get aggy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's when patience was tested. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So if they delayed it a third time; </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did they delay a third time? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the scope of the
game was just over-ambitious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] I think it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was just too much.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like in this current day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't make what
they were trying to make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to the level that they were advertising. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Within a reasonable time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you know the more
GUIs you sink into it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's only so many sales
you can get on a game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without DLC and battle
passes and all that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was just gonna be a
game with maybe DLC, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe they'd get some
micro-transactions in there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but realistically, it
wasn't gonna be anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that would crush numbers
we'd never seen before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like-
- [Garnt] I guess so, I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like how do you
convince the investors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to stick around and be happy? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you gotta, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a lot of pressures
from outside forces. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, it's a business. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We can't forget. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And also, is it fair to ask people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to spend like 10 years of their life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the same fucking thing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In some ways I'm like, "I
guess they're being paid." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mangakas be like, "Just 10 years?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, mangakas are built different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The Japanese work ethic is just something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we just don't have in the West. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Those dudes are chill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Those are rookie numbers.
Gotta pump them up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, in the case of mangakas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's all they have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even Araki said, who did JoJo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he said that the reason why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he split it into parts of
generations is he said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "I would get bored drawing
the same characters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for 35 years." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He had the foresight
to see that he would, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I don't blame him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Could you imagine you gotta
draw fucking Mickey Mouse, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 150 times a day? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You'd blow your brain out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You'd know like the exact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> crotch size...
- That's what animes are, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You'd know the exact
gootch size of Mickey Mouse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can you imagine if fucking Jonathan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was still the main character
of "JoJo" to this day? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You ended up not even
liking the character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you made after x amount of time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You'd lose your mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You'd go crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can relate to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because as a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I always like working on something new. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Working on a new kind of content, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as I'm sure you guys do as well, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I can't imagine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> also dedicating that much
time to just a single project. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know there are people
who have done that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially in indie video games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's just a one-man team </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> working on this one game
for fucking years and years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Google the Russian film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's been in production
for like 50 years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Just type that in. Type that into Google. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I watched this thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this video from Atrocity Guide. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's about this video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about this Russian animation producer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> who hand-draws every single frame. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh! I think I know who
you're talking about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like the Walt
Disney of Russia, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's super acclaimed and famous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> His animations are insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But he's been working
on this one animation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for a ridiculous amount of years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's never gonna be finished at the rate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause he's like nearly dying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's very, very old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's not even halfway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's like 30, 40
years in or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Really long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What kind of movie is he making? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's animated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's an animated story about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's called "The
Raincoat" or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Nabi] "The Overcoat". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "The Overcoat". That's it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, "The Overcoat". Is
that what it's called? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Nabi] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - How many years it
been in production for? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 40 years?!
- 40 years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's been in production
has been for 40 years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Has he released previews? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Has he just said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Guys, I'm working on this
video. It's coming out." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The yellow delay thing
comes out every 10 years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Guys, gimme another 10 years." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Imagine if- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - People reply to it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "I took work off to watch
this, what the fuck?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Imagine YouTubers being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Guys, I'm working on
something big. It's big." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Ten years later, "Guys,
I'm still working on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's gonna be something big." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Update video every 10 years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - They've released portions of the film </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you can watch, and
it is very beautiful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's also really
sad 'cause it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, this thing, this set of drawing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that has consumed this man's life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that has drove this man to insanity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and ruined all of his
relationships and everything," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause he's also like a dick to everyone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because every director
ever is a massive dick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and he's really
apparently very harsh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> works insane hours, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> makes his wife work like
crazy, as well and... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How's he getting paid? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think donations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kickstarter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Kickstarter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kickstarter, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Indiegogo, GoFundMe, and all the works. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - God, he must have gone through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every donation platform known to man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if he started 40 years ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So they don't have any
technology in the studio. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They refuse to have any technology, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause of course they do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They do it all by hand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's like, at what point, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you are making something for so long, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are you like, "Come on, fuck off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can't finish it. Stop
now, this is a joke." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Sort it out, mate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Sort your life out, come on." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's more to life
than just this one project. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well you know, it goes past the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where you are just
letting this consume you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to a point where you're
not creating any more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just taking a whole... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just an addiction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This isn't healthy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're not gonna finish it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At that point, no
matter what you release, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is never going to be
worth the amount of hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Forty years of your life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean there's only a few things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that are worth 40 years of your life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't get me wrong, it looks amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's also very sad
hearing the story of this guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it just takes over his life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, he must really love it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure that's an
understatement of the year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's an obsession. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it desperation? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's probably one of those things where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's definitely not
healthy, whatever it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not like a passion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He has passion, but... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's only a passion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's obsession. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Obsession is different from passion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's the longest you guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have ever worked on a single project? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, 'cause you recently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just uploaded your cosplay video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Very good, very good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I remember every
few weeks or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd be like, "Yeah,
I'm going to a shoot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the cosplay video." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I swear that went on for a
fucking year or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it took long time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, it's all right, it was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's good fun. It wasn't too long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Is that the
longest thing you worked on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, not hours put in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but as in time and number of shoots, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it was the most. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fine. It wasn't too hands-on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Just kind of getting the
edit down was difficult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's the most you've ever
put into one project then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my gosh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, I'll go first then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Is yours the "Fate" one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The most I've ever put in was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> must be 10 years ago or something now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I made this Top 20 list called </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "The Top Coolest Anime
Characters of All Time" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something along those lines. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds like a 2010 Gigguk video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - How did this take you years? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, so get this. It was eight parts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - (sighs) Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was an eight-part series, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because I would spend... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Eight-part
featuring 10 characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, 20 characters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So every part would contain
two or three characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and each part would be at
least 15 to 20 minutes long. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was working on
this one single project </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically throughout university. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I basically wasn't uploading anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but this one fucking series. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I realized, about two videos in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after I'd spent months
just working on two videos, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, "I've
made a massive mistake." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Did you finish it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did finish it.
- [Connor] Wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It took me an entire year to finish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it took me an entire year to finish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember when I finished it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was basically when I
graduated from university... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Jesus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I put the script of this Top 20 list </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> next to my dissertation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The top 20 list was twice
the length of my dissertation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I had worked my last year in uni on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hell, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So my dissertation, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which I spent an entire year working on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was half the length of this
fucking YouTube video series </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I'd worked on in that same year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So that was- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. At some point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not motivation
that's keeping you going, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because when you have a project that big, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just wanna finish it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just so you can fucking finish it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - All through, you just wanna stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't; you've started. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The Yaoi audiobook, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which took me a month of probably
at least five days a week, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eight to 12 hours nonstop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Reading this fucking book
over and over again nonstop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Read that book so many times, I hate it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hate it now. I can't look at it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It drives me insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like it. I like it a lot, but I hate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause you get to about
50, 60% of the way in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're just like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] I'm done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is shit. I'm done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not doing this anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then you're like, "But I gotta finish it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> There's just something about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> having an unfinished project that just... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - 50, 60% in, you can't stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - People are gonna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, where's EvAbridged 2.0?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I did the first film. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That, to me, is a completed project." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Part of the big reason I
didn't wanna continue that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was because I didn't wanna
put that upon myself again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to start a project that I knew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was gonna take fucking years to finish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what excites me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's what also scares me the most, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when it comes to taking on a big project. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I've got a lot of different ideas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for a lot of big projects
I eventually want to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But just knowing what it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you are excited, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're motivated for the first half, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then that just peters off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you start hating your project
and start hating yourself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I just want to get this done." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That to me is such an awful grind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What about you, Joey?
What was your longest? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, I mean... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is there a video that
stands out as being grueling? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Or anything you worked
on music-wise, anything? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, music-wise, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My first album took me like two years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah 'cause how long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> were you working on that album for? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The first album, I took like two years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] That's on-and-off, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, that was on-and-off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause that was just like a side project. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you throw a little
bit here and there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, whenever I felt like doing it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's not really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> my career isn't dependent on my album. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - When did you feel like it was ready </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to be released? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I've had side projects like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you do a certain percentage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you realize, "Wait a minute, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I might actually get to the end of this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I might actually be able to finish this." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, the first album
was like eight tracks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think by track six, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Okay, is this enough for an
album or should I add more?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Then after that, it was kind
of a rush of inspiration </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's you start
to see the final product. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> The goal is right there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I just need to run to it now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The last 5% is actually really fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when it all starts to come together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> The last 5% is like, "Hell, yeah." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In terms of videos, not too sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the reason why a lot
of my videos take so long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is because either me, with
whatever I'm working with, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> takes a long time just come back to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> A lot of it is just waiting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I did that video with Ladybeard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where we run around the figurine factory. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When we did that video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that video took like eight months. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh god, counting time
just getting prepped, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a different thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tell me you're a Japanese YouTuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> without telling me you're
a Japanese YouTuber. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That video took me eight months, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but seven of those months </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> was just waiting for
them to give me the okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and give me a good date to start. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Then the actual shoot took
like a day and a half. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So I feel like, in terms of just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sheer working on a video time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe a month is max. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't tell you which video it is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but I have a couple of videos like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel that with Trash
Taste specials there as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like the lead... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The specials, I think, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely the longest so far. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The lead time for the
specials is just so fucking long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that sometimes you forget
that they're coming out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, "Was this a good
special? I can't remember." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember seeing the first draft </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of the drifting special
and the cycling special. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember my first thought was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "God, I can't believe
I wasted all this time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to record this shit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - By the time this episode comes out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the cooking special's probably out, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I guess we can talk about that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because that, oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that first draft took like how long? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's just because I think
it was one of those situations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where Trash Taste takes priority. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And because we're not, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause we know people are willing to wait. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It does take a while, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's not prioritized at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> We don't say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I guess we do
want it to be the best. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we don't mind making wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause so much work goes into the shoot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the one thing I
don't want to compromise on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in terms of quality. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can we talk about the Kendo special? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] I guess.
- [Connor] Sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so we released a picture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> of us filming a Kendo special. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] God, how fucking bad was that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was months and
months and months ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A lot of viewers may have
just forgotten about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I know I see some Reddit
posts every now and again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bringing that special up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, "When's the Kendo special coming?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "When is it coming?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We actually scrapped the special </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because we filmed for an entire day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We got all the source footage </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then Mudan edited a first draft </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we thought it was shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And we thought, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "There's only so much we can save </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> through editing and voiceover," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause the source footage, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unfortunately, just wasn't there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we had to make the decision, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Do we try and maybe frame this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe release this as a mini-special </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or maybe something different? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe it goes in the After Dark channel?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But we eventually came to the decision </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we spent an entire day filming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We hired three cameramen, four, maybe four </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Ashley as a sound guy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we hired the Kendo people,
and we scrapped it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We just scrapped. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I think in general, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was room for salvation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I don't think it would've, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think we can all agree </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it wouldn't have been up to the standard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of where we see Trash Taste specials. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - At best, it could've
been 10 or 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it could have been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a decent vlog-style video
or anything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But as a special, and especially
after the cycling special, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we wanted to make something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that was at that level
of quality or above. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The Kendo special, no
matter how much we could do, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> no matter how much Mudan could do, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just would not get to that standard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, that doesn't mean we're not going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to do a Kendo special. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Part of the reason we decided to scrap it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was because we saw
potential to make it right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We learned a lot on that shoot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, we did learn a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, you don't learn
without failing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It fucking hurt 'cause I remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we were discussing what
to do with this special </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for so fucking long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Do we release it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do we try and do something with it?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was just on the back burner </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for months and months. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a hard decision, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I feel like it's moments like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you really really learn something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Part of the reason I
think the cooking special </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is going to be good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was because we took so many of the lessons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we learned from this failed special, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which we may reboot to a proper special </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that meets our standard, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but we took so much from
this one experience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which was a very expensive mistake, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was an expensive experience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but that's kind of the quality, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the bar of quality we wanna set, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at least for our specials. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A fucking podcast, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we can just argue about bone-on chicken </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or fucking whatever
shitty food take we get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the millionth time, and that's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but the special is something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we really wanna make
sure we hit the nail on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> The cooking special will be out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by the time this episode comes out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Nabi] It's the previous episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the episode before this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, it's the episode before this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Nabi] This is 82, if I'm not mistaken. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Nabi] You want the cooking special, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 81 special. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We hope you just enjoyed
the cooking special. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, by the time you
guys are seeing this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you can see the cooking
special from last week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But we don't know, as of
us recording right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So yeah, hopefully, you guys enjoyed that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Got robbed by Meilyne's bullshit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No you didn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You were never close to winning, Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You were never close to win. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You were never going to win. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No doubt Meilyne kneecapped me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Meilyne was an impartial judge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She played her role perfectly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - She was the chaotic evil
that we needed in that video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Impartial judge, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, dude, it's because of my sweat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It tasted better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Obviously, that was the reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, this. You were missing this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you haven't watched
it, watch the Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Go watch the Trash
Taste Cooking Special. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We did put a lot of work into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I think the aim for 2022 for us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is to maybe get a couple
more specials out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That'd be nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] I mean that- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Without compensating quality, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We've got a few ideas, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which I think are gonna
be really really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They're gonna be big, as
well, so don't worry about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's all bad. We could have done more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, we could have. We could have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We could have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but it would've been really difficult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the year that we had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially with the restrictions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was very difficult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Part of the reason was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every time we'd come
up with a special idea, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we'd just go to Meilyne or GeeXPlus like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, can we get approval for this place?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they'd be like, "Nope,
everything's under lockdown." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that would just delay things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for another few months and
then the next few months. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then that was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the first three-quarters
of the year, basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then scrapping the one special </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really set us back on the schedule. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a bit unfortunate, really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So we could have had
two specials this year, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we scrapped one special. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ideally, want what, three a year? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that the soft thing
that we set? Three or two? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd like at least two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want to push too far. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - As someone who just cut
back to two uploads a month... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let's promise two-
- It was two months. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's promise-
- I'm gonna say two a year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's promise two at least,
but let's try for three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's try for three. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We'll try for three, yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because some of the ideas we have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> are going to take months
of fucking planning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, haven't already.
- Two at least. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Three maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The optimistic side
of me says three a year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the realistic side
of me says two a year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We got our streams too, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we got our streams we're
focusing on as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We've got this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And all three of us
- We'll get three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We'll get three. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fully HD. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's do five. No, fuck
it, let's do one a month. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - One a month?! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, I remember when... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So we are hiring about
20 content producer roles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember when I started Anime Minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I promised one a month, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and look how that turned out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, that's just clown. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That's clown buffoonery
right there, Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Bro, how are you gonna schedule
voice acting sessions, bro? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought I'd min-maxed it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I realized that
I couldn't get it to the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it actually wasn't the voice acting side. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just the scripting side, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where I couldn't get it to the quality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I wanted for every series. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's also just gonna
be hard to do three a year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not only because of, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the After Dark stuff we're doing as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But also just the fact that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think on all our main
channels, we're just gonna, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 2022 is just like another
step in quality up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And just time taken, so it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, we need all the help we can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Help me, please.
- Help us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Help, help, help. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Please help. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I would like to, just for myself, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I would like to get at least
two out a year, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, we could have
easily done it last year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And we did film two last year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We did do last two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, if one wasn't a learning experience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we would've had two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that I think that- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If we didn't fuck up, you'd have two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Unfortunate circumstances made us fuck up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, it's whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But speaking of something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is not going to
be a special just yet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we almost died! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can we pee?
- Wow, callback. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have to pee if
we're getting into this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whoa, Connor needs to pee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is going on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Keep this in, Mudan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> This is rare evidence of Connor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> asking for a toilet break </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before me or Joey have even asked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] I've never asked a pee before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me have this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll take this rare
opportunity to also pee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I might as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This episode is sponsored by ExpressVPN. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Watching Netflix
without using ExpressVPN </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like paying for a gym membership, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but only using the treadmill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can relate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To elaborate on that
comment I just made, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ExpressVPN allows you
to change your location, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which means that you get access </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to Netflix's full library of content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - They have over a hundred
different server locations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you can gain access to
thousands of new shows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This works with many other
streaming services too, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like BBC iPlayer, YouTube, and more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So on Netflix, I can't
watch "Saving Private Ryan". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - One of my favorite war movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not available in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So what I do is I flick on ExpressVPN, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> move it over to a new country, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and bam, it's ready
and available to watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So simple. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Plus it's compatible
with all your devices, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> phones, laptops, media
consoles, smart TVs, and more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> ExpressVPN also encrypts all your data. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It has the added benefit
of encrypting your data </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you can browse the

<SPEAKER_03> So don't be stupid; be smart. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And we are back from our piss break. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why did you say that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's kept in this time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So they knew that we
were having a piss break. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - At least an ad in between
that or something, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Just a break, otherwise,
it'd be very awkward. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, we're either coming back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> from an ad break or piss break. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A piss break, or
double, both, who knows? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, as Garnt said, we almost died. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not really. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But not really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's I mean- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a YouTuber "we almost died." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Under certain circumstances, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure we could have died but... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It felt like I was
dying. That's for sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you guys probably saw on
our social medias that we- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you don't, follow us on Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes, please follow us all on Twitter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Trash Test as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But we posted a couple of
photos of us going camping. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So many people thought, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Camping Special? Your Camping Special?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> No, it's not.
- It's not a bad idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not a bad idea, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but we do like to hang
out as mates as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're appalled that sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we just hang out without cameras. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Holy shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are we allowed to do
that? Is that legal? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, we did take pictures. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's not part of my contract. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We've got cameras in there, come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But we didn't film it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was going vlog it
for the second channel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was having too much fun, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I was like, "Fuck it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Vlog what? Us just getting smashed? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so basically Nabi, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who works behind the camera, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as well as a bunch of his
friends and the three of us, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we went camping to Mount Fuji, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was awesome until... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] It was awesome
until we almost died. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Until we had to sleep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It is the first time I've been camping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in these kind of weather situations. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it was the first time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So camping in England, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The most you gotta worry
about is some mild rain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like a mild annoyance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've camped in the
winter before, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In the UK? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I'm pretty sure,
but it wasn't that cold. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> How cold does it get in
the UK in the winter? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It depends where you are in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause a lot of places snow, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> In the UK? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, snow's fine though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Snow's all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Snow's all right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, snow that cold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it wasn't even
snowing where we were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was fucking cold. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Everything was frozen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, frozen is worse than cold. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - When the grass is frozen, it's way cold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause when the snow's compact,
it doesn't feel as cold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But we basically went to
this place called Fumotoppara, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which, if you've watched "Yuru Camp", </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is the place where they're going to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that legitimately where they went? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it the actual Yuru Camp place? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's actually where they went. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, it's the actual location. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bruh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is why there's so
many Yuru Camp references. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They fucking lied to me.
They fucking lied to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They made it look comfy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's comfy about -5 degrees weather, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to sleep in a fucking tent? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was nothing comfy about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let me give you the low down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, please. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Please do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - First of all, it began
in a group chat, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A camping trip. We're
gonna do a camping trip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Group chat. I'm checking out immediately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm that one friend that doesn't
read the group chat at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't look at it, whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you want something from me, message me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't open group chats </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because the moment I see 20 messages, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "All right,
peace." I'm not reading 20. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Gimme CliffsNotes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I'm like, "Can
someone just tell me?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sorry for your loss,
but I'm not reading that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dunno about you boys. This is my POV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a few days before, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh yeah, shit, I don't have anything." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I realized I didn't have anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Oh yeah,
I have camping stuff," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> thinking back to the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Oh shit, I
don't have camping stuff." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right.
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought I had a sleeping bag. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I did not have a sleeping bag. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't bring a chair, forgot about that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I had to buy a chair last minute. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I went on Amazon panickingly,
like two days before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they told me to buy stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I was like, "Oh
shit, I didn't buy stuff." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I started looking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there was only one sleeping bag </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was available to be
delivered in time before I left. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could have gone to a store. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't wanna go to a store. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, "I'll get one off Amazon." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm lazy. I bought a
chair, too, and it arrived. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> The chair was very heavy, very big. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "Fuck." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Too be fair, it was
worth it though, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, the chair came in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I had the best
chair in the end, actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was this chair that... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because Joey's one had water damage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from the amount of times
he'd put it outside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This chair is quite
heavy, very big, I'd say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not that big,
actually, yours was bigger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it was a chair where the
back was connected to the legs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So when you leaned on the
back, the legs popped up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I don't know, man.
It was so satisfying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like a reclining
chair, but camping. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Anyway, so I got all the stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "All right, I've
been camping a ton before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's whatever, I don't
need to buy too much." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's one night. One night camping is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Bro, I could just do
that with my clothes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll just sleep on the grass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not a big deal, right? I'll be fine." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I've done that before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We've like slept outside
with just sleeping bags. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We have done that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly. No tent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've done that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've done it too, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is not a big deal. I
thought, "It'll be fine." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - If the weather's good
especially, which it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nabi was like, "Oh, did
you get thermal wear?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Get thermal wear?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not getting thermal
wear, I mean, what the fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm camping, I don't need thermal wear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll wear a hoodie, bro. It's fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mind you, we went
first week in December. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So most places in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it hasn't quite gotten
to winter weather yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It definitely isn't that cold in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, here's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He said that to me and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'll look how cold it's gonna be." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It predicted like one degree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was like, "One degree is fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> If I'm sleeping in my clothes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a sleeping bag, in a
tent, one degree is fine." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I had like a hoodie and a big coat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had a long sleeve T-shirt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "I'll be fine, I'll be fine." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was not fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, we're talking Celsius by the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Celsius. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're talking of Celsius. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For American, that's
four lollipops, actually, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in case you're wondering about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like 36 Fahrenheit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's very cold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's what we thought it was gonna be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Anyway, we had a great time, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We got in the car. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Played some beats, we
had a nice car journey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> two-hour car journey to Fuji. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's pretty chill from Tokyo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Got the most insane views of Mount Fuji. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. It was clear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - My god, I mean you saw the
pictures, the fucking views. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The reason we went in winter was because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's no mist, no cloud at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just a clear picture of Mount Fuji. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Every picture I took of Mount Fuji </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually looks photoshopped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's un-fucking-real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] We put that green screen to work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] It was amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> There was not a cloud in sight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - On the car there, I was
getting kind of toasty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was getting a little bit too hot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just took my hoodie off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The sun was out, it was beaming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Beaming on me. I was one-layering. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Bro, this is gonna be easy." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then, if all else failed,
I would have beer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So if I got super cold, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> at least I would be moderately
drunk and I could sleep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I thought... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] That was also my strategy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mind over matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is a foolproof plan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Nothing could go wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We've been camping before, me and Joey, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we weren't going to
make the same mistake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We bought way too many beers this time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We bought two more crates of beers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than we actually needed in the end. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because I thought everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was gonna pull their weight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, everyone had
around the same amount. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some people had one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Had one beer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - From 72 beers that we bought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> That is not pulling your weight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think we all had maybe
seven or eight beers at least. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was very drunk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like seven or eight beers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Imma say that some people, I heard, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weren't able to sleep during the trip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because it was so cold, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just saying I did sleep a bit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had some beers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So what can you say?
What can you say, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> What can you say? Life-hack, life-hack. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We'll get that POV later on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So we go to nearest
supermarket to this place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We raid their entire beer stock, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their bread stock, their sausages. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck, the sausages were so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's just something about sausages </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> on a charcoal grill that
just hits different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just meat. Just any meat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But sausage is the
best, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, I'm gonna say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when we were buying sausages, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's just like, "Oh,
just buy the original flavor." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Buy more, buy more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, you were saying just
buy the original flavor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just buy the original flavor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I pick up the chili cheese
flavor and everyone looks at me- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want that shit.
- in such disgust. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone looks at me with such disgust of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Garnt, what are you doing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Get your trash taste out of here." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then when we started eating it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was the sausage that went the quickest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone loved it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like the other one the most. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I like the other one more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck you, Joey. That's not
what you were saying earlier. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, because I was curious, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause everyone around me was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, these chili cheese
ones are really good." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "All right, bet." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had it and I was like, "Yeah,
that's pretty all right." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's not what you
said. That's not what you said. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You haven't had a good sausage, guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was probably three or four beers in? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was super optimistic
and so I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah this is great." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your Honor, he was drunk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My client... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your Honor, I was not
sober when I had those. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was inebriated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You think you can use that excuse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for drunk-trying sausages? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You think that holds up in a court of law </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with drunk driving? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> No, it doesn't, Joey. It doesn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Can't believe I
was get betrayed by this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He said it. It doesn't mean
it was a good decision, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't quite kill another person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> eating those sausages. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You killed my spirit, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I killed my taste buds.
- When I heard that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] I killed my taste buds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You killed my spirit.
That's all that matters, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Nabi] I'll send this for production. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So we raid the supermarket. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We take everything, we get
every condiment known to man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I was glad, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes people, when they
buy all the meat and stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they forget to buy the condiments. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But arguably, we bought
too many condiments. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - This bougie motherfucker
bought Dijon mustard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't. That wasn't me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who bought the Dijon mustard? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Someone else put it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Nabi] I did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So Nabi, you put Dijon mustard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Someone put Dijon mustard
when we were on a barbecue. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Bro, just get
the squirty, the other one." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was the one in the jar, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where you have to get it with a knife, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was no knives. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was like, "What do you
expect? Just fucking..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're gonna get in
the Dijon on my hot dog. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> By the way, there was no hot dog buns, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause sometimes they
don't have hot dog buns </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in the supermarkets in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So we did the Joey way of doing it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is folding a piece of bread- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Australian way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The Australian way, it's also a sandwich. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Getting one slice of
bread and rolling it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Folding it around,
that's the Australian way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was kind of sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the only way to do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, it's fine. It tasted fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But it just looked sad, it looked sad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It literally does the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> purpose here.
- It does the same job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually, if anything
you get to eat more- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - All bread tastes the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would argue it's better, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you eat less bread, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> therefore, you have
more space for sausage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I agree. I never finished
the entire sausage- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The hot dog buns are so thick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The entire hot dog bun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause there's always more bread needed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than the sausage in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't believe these takes actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not even, you know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hot dog buns are overrated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm so done. That was such a shit take. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not even... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not arguing this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] I mean, what
are you talking about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I refuse to go down
to the level of clowns. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not arguing this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Let that take speak for itself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just gonna say I don't agree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Respectfully, I disagree, Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the bread is the perfect amount. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Anyway. I can't believe you said that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm in awe. I can't believe it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Imma say it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So we buy the all food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the supermarket-
- It's too thick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Stop. It's not. It's literally not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - On the chunk chart, it
is like the second half. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It it's pretty thick, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like twice the thickness of- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - People who love hot dogs here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are dying right now, dying inside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's all I'm saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, so we spend $400 on this food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for nine, seven, eight of us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, 400 bucks on food. It was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And booze. It was mostly the booze. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like half booze, actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Nabi] Meat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So we bought it all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and we finally started
setting up our camp, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and getting the fire going, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which was the most important of all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We had two fire pits going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and then we bought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> two little baby stacks of
plywood or whatever it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It wasn't plywood, but it may
as well have been plywood. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like 2x4s. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Luckily, the store there
sold a shit ton of firewood. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So we bought a fuckton of firewood. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, in Japan you
have to buy your firewood. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't just go into the bush. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, you can't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] No. You gotta buy your firewood. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, to be fair, in most places </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in most campsites, official
ones, you can't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Europe as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't just start chopping down trees </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> unless the site says you can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But most people don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how to chop down the tree, though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and wouldn't know how to do it safely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But in Australia, we
don't like go around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking deforesting or anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But if you go out into the bush </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you see anything like-
- You can pick up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the dead leaves.
- Logs and dead branches </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and stuff like that, you bring it back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's probably good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Problem is, though,
branches burn super fast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, that's why you gotta get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the thick, almost rotting wood. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They sold these really thick pieces </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of oak that were great, wonderful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> We start setting up a fire
and we started barbecuing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was great, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it was fantastic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We were having a fantastic time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a comfortable temperature as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was probably like,
maybe five degrees-ish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I would say it was
even warmer than that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe six, seven degrees. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pretty great time, start
cracking open the beers- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - With amazing view of Fuji as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Started enjoying the food.
- That was brilliant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey laughed at how I
ate a hot dog one time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You were laughing your ass off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> how I ate this hot dog one time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We were like five or six beers in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and Connor was obviously
getting a little bit tipsy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he took, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just caught my eye-
- It was a hot dog. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just looked over and
Connor had this hot dog bite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it looked like the hot dog </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was trying to escape out of his mouth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I shoved half
the hot dog in my mouth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He shoved in his mouth and just went, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all I heard was this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know the fucking video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of the pufferfish eating the carrot? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It does the sound. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I heard that coming out of Connor's mouth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as he was shoving this hot dog. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, "Oh my God." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Joey's like pissing himself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I-
- I was laughing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> for a good 15 minutes.
- I was like bending over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I-
- 'Cause there's a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of sauce on there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause the problem was
I did the rookie error </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> of putting way too much condiments, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I knew the condiments
was gonna come out, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What had happened was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I had taken a bite that was so big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I either committed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to putting it all in my mouth in one go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or if I bit it and stopped, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the condiments would just go all over me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I bent forward and just
shoved it all in in one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and all the condiments fell down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, "Hey yo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this boy's dicking down a hot dog." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like raw dogging
it, I was taking it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just so good, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what it is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for some reason, with hot dogs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it comes to barbecues, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can eat two burgers
and I'm like, "Oh, fuck." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hot dogs, I'm like, "Another
one. Another one, please." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like six in and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Let's go. Another hot
dog? Another hot dog?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - To be fair, those
sausages were really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I actually prefer hot dogs over burgers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah, me too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - In a barbecue. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause in a barbecue, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have one burger, and that's enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's enough, that's enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If we're gonna go with how
courses are structured, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me, the burger is the main course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But I can eat so much of the
hot dog around the burger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You start off with hot dogs,
and you have the burger, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then, for some reason, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can eat three more hot dogs sometimes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like my stomach is an infinite hole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> when it comes to hot dogs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We also had the skewers as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which just got demolished in five minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they were so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is it about burgers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is just like on a
different scale of filling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> compared to everything else we bought? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know.
- [Joey] I don't get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's just because it takes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that much more effort to cook. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] I guess, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause you have to
build the burger as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's a lot bigger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not just something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can casually pick up off the grill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just start eating.
- [Joey] That's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You gotta make sure it's
a nice burger that you like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You gotta make sure the
cheese is perfectly toasted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the way you want it to be toasted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We tried to butter our bread </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but the butter was so fucking cold </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I think it was Edo or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who tried to put blocks of
butter on the burger bun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it was like squares of
butter on this burger bun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it was too cold to be spread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then he just like
chucked it on the fire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He just chucked it on the fire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and all the chunks just fell down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was adamant that he could perfectly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> butter this fucking burger.
- I was like what are you... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was watching the
entire time, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What did you want to do?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] What were you
expecting to happen? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's just buttering the fire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - In my mind, when
you're barbecuing stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I expect the quality of this burger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to not be as on par as a restaurant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't need my barbecued
burger buttered bun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "You can just
toast it. It's fine." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it wasn't even the worst idea </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that happened during the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] This is a good idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know what you're gonna say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know when you're a few drinks in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you do something that
you think is a good idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Genius idea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So we also had eggs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but we had nowhere to cook the eggs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause it's a grill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We didn't bring pans or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no pans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We just had a grill, a mesh grill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So Connor comes up with the idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of trying to cook this
egg on a burger bun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I really wanted an egg on my burger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So what he does is he
places the patty on the grill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it was the bun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, sorry. It was the bun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> He places the bun on the grill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then he cracks an egg on top of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Naturally, all the white of the egg </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just fucking spills over
the edge and into the fire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I knew that would happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All that's left is a fucking yolk, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this yolk is, it's like ice hockey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just like slippering
around on this thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's just like trying to control it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> In the end, it spilled over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Went in the fire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was a very sad moment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was saying there's no way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could cook a egg on
a burger bun on a grill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's so many things that can go wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it did go wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Here's what my thinking was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Obviously, I was a few beers in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but I thought that the flames
of the fire were so big, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it was enveloping the bun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "It'll reach
the egg. It'll cook the egg. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It'll do it. It'll do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's hot enough. It'll do it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The entire time, as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he was like "Galaxy brain. Galaxy brain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Watch this. Gamer moment. Gamer moment." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like, "You are
wasting a perfectly good egg." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. I had an eggy bun, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it gave the good
egg flavor to my burger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> There was like 1/5 of the yolk left. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hey, it was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] You just made eggy bread. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't hate. I liked it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I liked it. It was good. It was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the world's
shittiest French toast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was amazing. I had a great burger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Nabi] Wrap in aluminum foil. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You were so dedicated
to cooking this egg, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was like watching someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> try to solve that Zelda puzzle
in "Breath of the Wild". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We know how fucking shitty it is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> controlling that puzzle with
your Wiimote or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You guys sit in your
comfort of knowing what works. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I am the daring type,
who tried something new. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanted to see if I could get an egg </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to cook on a burger bun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I knew it wasn't gonna go well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the whole ordeal started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with Connor going, "Watch this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Anything that starts with
a confident "watch this" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> five beers in, is not going to go well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Hold my beer." Imagine
if it worked, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd have been a fucking god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would've applauded you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would've been a god amongst men. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I made that work, I would've. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That would've been amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like Icarus, I flew
too close to the sun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I tried something that I shouldn't have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What can I say? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then you gave up and just
like flipped the burger, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then the rest of the
egg slid into the fire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, "If I can't have the egg </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> cook perfectly on the bun, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll at least have this
French toast flavor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to add to my burger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It added the flavor profile </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I was quite happy with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Suffice it to say that
the dinner went well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Then, under the stars,
it was amazing starlight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] View was amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mount Fuji in the background. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We had a good time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was a problem, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> We were running out of wood,
and the store had closed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was going to say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so we ate like kings
and we drank like kings. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We learned from the last camping trip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We overstocked on pretty
much every fucking resource </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we could think of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Food we did perfectly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We had a bunch of food left. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We still had a bunch of food left. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought we ate it all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I ate it while you were sleeping. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - If somebody had told
me, I would've ate it all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would have been done with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's because we ran out of coal, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we ran out of firewood. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In camping outside on a winter's night, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we ran out of the one
resource that is essential </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for basically human
survival, which is heat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It kind of sucked, 'cause it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, I'm pretty sure we
could still keep going." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it got to about 11
PM and we could see then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no. I remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It got to about 9 PM. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember 'cause it got to about 9 PM </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we still wanted to
cook some more food, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the wood just wasn't
bringing enough heat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to actually cook stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it was just charring
it and then going out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause we needed coal for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we decided to stop cooking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just keep on drinking, as you do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Keep going with the liquid dinner. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember it hit about 9 PM </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it started getting a bit nippy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it started going from a
comfortable temperature </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to, "Okay, now I gotta
put on this winter jacket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I'm actually
starting to feel this cold." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I went down to around
two, three degrees Celsius. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Then I remember
looking at the firewood. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We had somehow gone through
about 70% of the firewood </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that we had bought previously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember thinking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fuck. How much longer is
this going to last us?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember it was at that point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I think we subconsciously
started to ration it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it got colder, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I remember the fires </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also started to get colder as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause we weren't putting in the wood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> all willy nilly anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I noticed that people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were slowly approaching the
fire pit, closer and closer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was further away, initially. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I was like, "I
don't need that much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm fine. I'm hot." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then got to the
point where I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, I need the fire or I'm
actually gonna just die." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Our knees were
basically in the fire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Made me realize how shitty fires are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> They must have had to
literally sleep next to it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm like, "This shit is awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The range of this fire is terrible." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Air is a terrible insulator. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But I was like, "This is terrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to basically have
my hands in this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to be warm." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't believe Nature
nerfed the AoE of fire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can they fix that patch? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can I have the range increase of fire? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was not good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I dunno what
fucking Newton was thinking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's up with that? What's up? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You could try wind nerfing the AoE. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's too powerful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember the fire was hot
enough, being close to it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but then my ass was freezing fucking cold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So every so often, I'd
just have to put my ass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on top of the fire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Joey was just farting nonstop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> throughout the entire camping trip. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Every time he put his ass across the fire, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Joey, please
don't fart right now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I held my breath, 'cause
I knew if Joey farted, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I swear to God, it would've used up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the rest of the firewood. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The fire just starts to... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. No. First of all, when
you stand up for a moment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the chair that you've been
warming up for 30 minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> instantly becomes cold again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It instantly freezes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which sucks. Which meant
you didn't wanna move, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you had to pee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You had to also put stuff
on the fire or whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it was awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Also, one thing that
happened where I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "We're gonna die," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is that they try to
light the fire starters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a gas fire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] I remember that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So they tried to light, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the guys turned
on the gas for this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what would you even call it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Blowtorch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Propane torch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Blowtorch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Why the fuck
do we have a blowtorch? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why do we have something
like a normal lighter?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a match. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. But we had
a blowtorch, and he lit it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he went to go and
point it to start a fire, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the whole blowtorch just went on fire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Uh. You
might wanna put that out." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The torch was catching on fire, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the gas canister's right next to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like "Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
Fire plus can pressure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Uh-oh. Uh-oh." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "I'm getting away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck? Put it out! Put it out!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the thing is, we
were six or seven people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Everybody else is just
kind of sitting there like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, it's on fire." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember that exact moment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I backed off. I was running away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> People are just sitting there watching, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> not helping at all, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just watching this guy holding
this gas canister on fire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "I'm running away." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "What the fuck
are you guys doing? Run!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember my exact POV was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I see it happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I see him pointing it towards the fire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He presses the button and
then the gas just leaks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> throughout the entire can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the entire can is just covered. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Connor goes "fight or flight" mode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's just like when that one quiet kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reached for his bag, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's half a mile down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] I'm not liking this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Me, being six cans of
beers in, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, fire." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was only after Connor's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Guys, what the fuck are you
doing? We almost just died!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, "But
the fire. It's so pretty." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was holding fire. That's so cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - These guys didn't even say anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They literally sat there like
stoners, just watching this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I literally saw him
holding this can of fire, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like (laughs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The guy who was holding it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't remember who was holding it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but I was like, "Turn it
off! Turn the gas off!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Wayne was holding it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Our friend Wayne was holding it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He was like, "Oh." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - He didn't what to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - "What should I do?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, "Turn it off! Turn it off!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was about to be an ass... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I ran to a distance and then
I was giving instructions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Now turn it off!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember you running to a distance, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're like, "Guys, what
the fuck are you doing?! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> What are you doing?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, "Oh yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I should probably care for my life." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember thinking that
and I'm just like, "Nah." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Either run or
help. You have two options. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Should be all right.
Should be all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, yeah. Don't do what we did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Connor did the correct thing and panicked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I could have helped, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but also I would've had
to run around the fire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I don't know how dangerous this is." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My guess would've been, "How
about we leave it on the floor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then all run." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So that happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember if anything else happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> during the campsite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm pretty sure these
gas cans have fail-safes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so that even if they somehow
light on fire like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they don't... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why I was so calm. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But also I know that you can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> heat up a metal gas canister for very long </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before it goes boom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. That's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure the campsite
would've loved that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, we were all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We survived. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know how we survived. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We didn't end up on r/WatchPeopleDie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So don't worry. We're all good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All it took was a few
shakes and a bit of a blow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It wasn't a big fire, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was just fire plus
gas canister, not good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. That could have ended very badly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Under any other circumstance, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would've been in the same panic mode, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but kind of dunno why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was drunk, okay? I was very drunk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Shockingly calm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like, "Just put it out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just put it out." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember the thought
going through my mind of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I should get up and run, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but the seat's so comfy right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's really cold outside." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like your mom asking
you to get out of bed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when it's like 7:00 AM. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It is how people die. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Why people die in house fires. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is how people die. I was very stupid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But at the time, it just felt
like the right thing to do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in my mind. Which it wasn't. It wasn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was very dumb. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We could have died multiple times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> This is like a double
entendre, this title. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We almost died. We actually did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So then that happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it got to around to 11 PM? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] 11 PM? I could
have still kept going. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah, me too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanted to keep going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it gets to the point where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my entire life I've been
conditioned to think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that no matter how cold it gets, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can just drink more beer
and it will solve the problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This was the one time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I was outside with a thick jacket on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and drinking more beer
didn't solve the problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I just kept getting colder. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, "What's going on?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So I start trying to drink more beer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just kept getting colder. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, "What is this?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, the thing with alcohol </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that you don't actually get warmer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but your body just thinks you're warmer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, you just
think you're getting warmer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's just a testament to how cold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was actually getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> rather than how cold </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my mind was thinking it was getting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - At a point, I just wanted
to stop drinking the beer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because I would pick it up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it would just
literally be freezing cold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was not even nice to drink </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause of how cold it was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause outside was so cold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Would've been great in the summer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, in the summer, I'd have loved it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It would've been amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But when it's like zero degrees outside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're drinking zero-degree beer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not that great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was one of the few times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you drink a beer and it gets colder </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the longer you drink it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The beers would, 'cause
they're in a crate, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the beers would start off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at a reasonable amount of coldness </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they would get
to a reasonable coldness </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to ice cold to almost frozen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also, the thing about
ice cold beers that's nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is that you're not normally drinking it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in ice-cold conditions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it warms up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a nice temperature
and it's nice in your body. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, this is refreshing." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But when it's ice cold
in ice-cold conditions, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like, "This feels like a bad idea." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's torture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - "This feels like a bad combination." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Perhaps lukewarm beer would've
been better, or hot beer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's why they drink hot wine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the Christmas festivals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We did everything we
could to elongate this fire, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but nothing was working. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There was only so much we
could ration out this firewood. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the last log
lasted us for a full hour. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's only so many tiny little twigs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you find on the paddock right there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like, "Yes, this will do." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember there was a
tree next to where I pissed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I picked up the leaves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, "Okay, these
dead leaves, these'll work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And they gave us like
a microsecond of heat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that felt, to me at the
time, like a full 10 minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We start using the beer packaging. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So we had all the cardboard packaging, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we went from using the beer cardboard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to rationing it as a big burst of heat, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because that would give us
a nice big burst of heat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for a good five seconds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We'd all crowd around, and we were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "All right, boys, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when do we do the next one?
When do we use the next one?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] I can't wait new longer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We eventually just didn't
even drink the beers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But we'd still unwrap the beers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with all the packaging so
we could use it as fuel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Should have recycled,
but instead we needed heat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Eventually, we ran
out of things to burn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I know guys, I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ran outta resources. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I put Garnt in the fire. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Unfortunately, he didn't burn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So eventually, that was when we realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had to go to bed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so we packed everything up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - At this point, it was
maybe around -1, -2. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was starting to get
pretty fucking cold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was starting to
get pretty, really cold. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It was negative degrees. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> For you Americans, that's negative </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from the freezing point of water. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I dunno what the
freezing point of water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is in Fahrenheit, but it was below that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Below 32. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why is it 32? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause 32 Fahrenheit
is zero degrees Celsius. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did not know that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's 30-something. I'm pretty sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 33.8 is one degree Celsius. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 32 is zero. So it
was maybe 28 Fahrenheit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is when we came to realize how cold </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it really was going to be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without even like a piddly little fire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to heat us up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember me and Connor
went into our tent first. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So me and Connor slept
with Nabi in his tent, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Joey and Luke slept in another tent, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everyone else slept in a third tent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember Connor jumping in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Connor jumping in and just realizing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how flimsy and thin his sleeping bag was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I literally had gotten a raincoat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that had just been fashioned into... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It didn't have any padding or anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "This is what I get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for ordering the only
available sleeping bag </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on Amazon next-day delivery." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I remember it was like 20 bucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I remember, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the warmest coat you have, by far, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is your Drip jacket, and
this was the one time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the past month I've seen
you without the Drip jacket. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It would've been very,
very useful, I imagine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The reason I didn't bring it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is because we were gonna
be burning a lot of shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't want to get this nice jacket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I paid way too much money for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> super-smoky, and it's
probably gonna be messy, too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was messy. I dropped
condiments everywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "I'm gonna just leave that." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which I did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So Connor gets in this sleeping bag </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and soon realizes that
this is not going to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> warm enough at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He just gets over and he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Garnt? Garnt, I give you
permission to cuddle me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Garnt, we are cuddling tonight." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Connor, we
don't need to cuddle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We don't need to cuddle." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then I get into the tent and I realize, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fuck! We're gonna need to
cuddle tonight, Connor." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I take off my jackets,
as fast as possible, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then I try to get in the sleeping bag, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I zip myself up. I'm fucking freezing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I saw like two caterpillars
next to each other, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like cuddling with each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Then that still isn't warm enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I realized pretty soon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I have to sleep with my jacket on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because even with my jacket off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not going to be warm enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Luckily at this point, I
think we were pretty drunk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I must say it was very
funny from the other tent, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when all I could hear was,
"Garnt, cuddle me, now! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Get closer to me." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was freezing! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I'll be the small spoon.
You be the large spoon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Cuddle me now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Listen, I've seen enough
Bear Grylls to know what to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I knew what I needed to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Drink my piss, now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt, don't ask what I
fashioned my jeans into, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a piss filter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm already drinking the
water. You can go next. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've already pissed in it, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I was wearing
like maybe six layers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I had fashioned my spare T-shirt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and put it around my
neck as a neck warmer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it was so cold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. What was the
coldest part of your body? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What was the part that was hurting? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Both] My feet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was the feet for me, too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was wearing the FamilyMart socks; </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that didn't help. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The one time I was like,
"Dammit, FamilyMart!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was rocking a pair of jeans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It was fine. My legs were fine, honestly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That wasn't the problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was wearing a long-sleeve thin shirt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with a big thick jumper. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I went to bed using my coat as the pillow, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I didn't have a pillow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Woke up at like 2 AM, I
think, 'cause I was too cold. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I put the jacket on. It
didn't really help much, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause by that point,
I was already too cold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like the jacket was ice cold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like... 'Cause I was too cold. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wasn't heating up at
all. So it didn't help. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But my feet were just too cold. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The tactic that I had in my head was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Fall asleep before you really
start feeling the cold." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Before we went to the tent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we just started downing
beers like nobody's business. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're just like, "All right,
can we down a little bit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's do it. We fucking need
it to sleep in this weather." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So after we downed the beers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I start cuddling Connor, it worked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I fell asleep actually pretty fast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Me too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I got a good amount of sleep, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not good quality sleep. I felt rough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got like a good three,
four hours of sleep, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I remember waking
up at around 4:00 AM </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's when it
really started to hit me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the fucking situation I was in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was like the minimum. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What time did you wake
up? Or did you sleep at all? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I slept. I probably slept
maybe about two or three hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Then I woke up around
four-ish, the same thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then I was just like, "I can't. I can't." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I checked the temperature.
It was like -6 Celsius, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, "Fuck it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know that if you wake up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and you actually start looking
at your phone and stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you will wake up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So every time I woke up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I woke up sporadically
throughout the night, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I would just immediately force
myself to not do anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and go back to sleep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I got to sleep until around
5:56, I think I remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I got out of the tent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "I need to start walking." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - At that point, it was like
four or five degrees minus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got out at like 4:00 AM, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with all the clothes I had on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like, "I'm
just gonna go for a walk, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause this is the only
way I can be warmer." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was so much colder walking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. 'Cause I had the
problem of what happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> when you drink too many
beers. You need to pee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I really, really needed to pee, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and the toilet was very far away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I walked to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I bought a coffee from
a vending machine there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to heat my hands up, 'cause
I paid a dollar every time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I needed to heat my hands up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was so cold. I didn't even give a shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't drink the coffee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just used it as a hand warmer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was saving my life.
It was like my lifeline. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I had gone through four
of these $1 coffees </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just to keep my hands warm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I was like (shivering noises) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was dreadful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had to go pee, and peeing was painful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But luckily, the one saving
grace of this campsite, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was at the toilet,
thank God, praise Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had a bidet, and bidets have a heated... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Heated toilet seat! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I sat on this toilet
seat for a good 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just going (sighs blissfully), </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just knowing that my ass
was being warmed gracefully. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - One of my biggest fears
when it goes to camping, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is having to pee after
everyone's fallen asleep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I have the smallest
bladder in the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Getting out of the tent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Getting out of the tent
and waking everyone up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as you are going out the tent to pee, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which sometimes, if I'm drinking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need to pee two or three times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Next time, I'm just
bringing adult diapers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Luckily, they'll
warm you up, honestly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm bringing adult diapers next time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It would serve two things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It would warm up my legs and
my lower half of my body, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I wouldn't need to
worry about peeing anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hold on, I gotta warm up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually remember,
even before we went to bed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember telling these boys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> about my irrational fears </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when it comes to peeing when I'm camping. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you boys remember this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember stupid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because we were talking
about horror movies before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> something to do with horror movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't remember; I was
pretty fucking drunk, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but anytime I pee in the wilderness, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like camping or whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so you go up to a bush or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's a bush that extends
as far as the eye can see. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Anything can be hiding in that bush. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen enough horror movies to know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there could be a fucking monster
or Jason on the other side, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> waiting to chop me up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There could be anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So I have this irrational... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sorry. What are you, five years old? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yes, Joey. I'm five years old. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like Dexter's chilling in
the bush waiting for you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - He could be. So ever since I was a kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every time I would go up to pee by myself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd hear the boys just
bantering in the background. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd be about 20, 30
meters away, in the dark. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So they can't really see
me. But they know I'm there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm peeing in this bush, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I always have this irrational fear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that something is going
to come out of this bush </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and attack me or grab me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or a creature's gonna chomp
me up or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause that's what happens
in every horror movie, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's always the guy taking the piss </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> next to the lakeside or the bush </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that he never expects
it. He's a bit drunk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's when they die.
That's when they always die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. You need to cut
down on the horror movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think Sydney's making you watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> one too many horror movies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So every time I go pee, I'm eagle-eyed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> looking for any movement. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Any shake of the bush, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like ready to leg it the other way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even care if my
dick's out at this point, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm legging it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You should be thankful
that it was so cold, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because if it wasn't that cold, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I would've absolutely trolled you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it was cold, here I am, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here I am, keeping an
eagle-eye out of any sign </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of a possible monster that
could come out of the bush. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But me being drunk, one of
you guys say something funny, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> start laughing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I look over, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "The boys are just being boys." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I look back over and
I see someone's breath </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going towards me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like a white cloud. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like a white cloud. I'm like, "Fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's a monster hiding in that bush." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Then I soon realized,
literally half a second in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's just my piss steaming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] So I gave myself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my piss gave me a mini... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You got scared from your pee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Idiot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My piss gave me a
mini-fucking-heart attack, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because I thought there was
a monster hiding in the bush. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, that's the
funniest thing I've ever heard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That already shows how
cold it was even before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> even before we started sleeping. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So luckily, I'd held my
piss for as long as I could, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> until I woke up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember waking up and I was just... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can't get back in that
sleeping bag once you wake up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not possible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I gave up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. So I remember waking up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I tried to go back to sleep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Of course, this was the exact moment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that Connor and Nabi decided
to have a snoring contest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Nabi] It wasn't us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes. Yes. You guys definitely did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why they
chose this exact moment, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I remember waking up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why do you think I
got my own tent, dude? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like you can't hear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You were like four feet
away from me, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember waking up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was like dead silence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember I had about a good
10 minutes of dead silence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember checking my bladder, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be like, "Do I need to pee?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, thank God. I don't need to pee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Thank God. My bladder's empty enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for me to be able to go back to sleep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I turn over, try and find
a nice comfortable position, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I just hear Connor
next to me going (snores). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Connor, don't don't don't.
Don't you fucking dare." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then he doesn't do anything more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then Nabi just goes (snores) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I'm just like,
"No, no, please no." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get another five seconds of silence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Connor turns over. (loud snore) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm just like, "For fuck's sake." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm trying to get the blood
flowing as much as possible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm breathing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do remember that moment actually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because that was around the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where I decided to wake up
and all I could hear was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what sounded like two
really old motorboats </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to start up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (imitates motorboat) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was just like a feedback loop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You just kept feeding into each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, "Are they going?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't normally snore, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but when I have to sleep on my back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's when I snore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also, you guys were drinking, as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Naturally, you snore more when you drink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, that wasn't the only dilemma </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had to go through because now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at this point, I had
sobered up a lot more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> at least a lot more that I
could definitely feel the cold. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I realized that being in a tent, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you can warm up your body, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but the air in the tent is still cold. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is still cold air. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was trying to
breathe through my nose, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I swear to God, every breath I took </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like freezing the
moisture inside my nose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you saying you
became a mouth-breather? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So while these guys... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Stole my old
tactics, be a mouth breather. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - While these guys are
having a snoring contest, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm here trying to successfully
breathe through my nose </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> without it hurting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> After about five minutes, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I gotta become a..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is this, "Demon Slayer"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have to master the
breathing technique. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "I'm going to
become the thing I detested." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I became a mouth breather. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But even that didn't help. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I tried breathing through my mouth, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was still too fucking cold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So I had to take my jacket off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and try to fashion this kind
of pillow-scarf kind of thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where my face was being covered. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that I had enough air. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cosplaying "Dune" or something? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kind of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I tried to masquerade this mask on me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I had enough air to breathe, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was also insulating the cold air. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That didn't work, because then, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if anyone's tried to sleep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the blanket over your head, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you soon realize that you
can't fucking breathe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can't breathe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's very stuffy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. You're gonna get very stuffy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're probably gonna die
of carbon dioxide poisoning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So basically, I had to make the choice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of trying to sleep suffocating
myself or freezing my lungs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Neither choice sounded
like a good choice to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So here I am for 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would put the cover over my head, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> try to breathe through
it for a good 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Doesn't work, take it off.
Find another position. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sounds like you were one step away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> from just breathing your
own farts for warmth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, that might have
honestly been the best solution. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, I would've taken
any solution that worked, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but eventually me trying to go to sleep, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor eventually wakes up
and he goes out the tent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I try sleeping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for another half an hour to 45 minutes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before I just give up
and just try going out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> At that point, everyone's already out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't know what these guys were doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought Connor had gone
for a walk or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought maybe they'd
gone back to another tent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had no idea what they were doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I remember them talking outside, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but when I went outside, nobody was there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, I remember trying to
find where everyone was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then for some reason, I felt the car, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or I heard the car engine purring. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Why is the car
on? What's going on here?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Keep in mind, I had
contacts on before I slept. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I had taken them off.
I couldn't see shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was trying to feel my way through. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everything was blurry for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I go towards the car, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I see Connor just
sleeping on the driver's seat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> These motherfuckers had gone into the car. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Big brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Had gone into the car, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> turned the engine on, and
just slept in the car. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck the camping trip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They had gone back to civilization. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Listen, in my mind, I'm
like, "Listen, I've slept. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's 6:00 AM. It's technically morning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I've awoken. Now I want to get warm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm going in the fucking car." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because at that point I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "What do we actually do?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "I can't sit
on the toilet for hours." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're not gonna leave
for a few more hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "There's nowhere
I can go to get warm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No one can accuse me of not camping. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I slept in the tent until 6:00 AM. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm now going in the car to heat up." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I joined him, obviously,
to warm up a bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Turned the engine on for a bit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it got hot enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then the sun was starting to come out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so we just turned it off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then we're just chilling in the car. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I slept like four hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I'm giving them shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the only reason I'm giving them shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was because I saw Connor
sleeping in the car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, "You fucking
genius. Big brain mode." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, "Galaxy brain". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I excitedly open the
car door, being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You fucking geniuses." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Then I quickly see that
all the seats are taken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So originally, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Come on, Joey, let's go in the car. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna go in the car." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't want all this wasted
electricity that I'm using, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it is a massive
waste of electricity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But at the time, I was
like, "I'm gonna die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna get in the
car. It's -4. Fuck this." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The other people were
taking photos of Fuji </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were dying for their craft. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I salute them, but not me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had nothing to gain from that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, "I'm going in
the car, Joey, come on in." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then slowly, everyone
started trying to get in the car, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause they were also freezing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then it basically turned into a sauna, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where people were coming in and out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just trying to warm up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Because I opened the car door, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and every fucking seat was
taken, and it wasn't filmed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm glad it wasn't filmed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it would've quickly turned into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the saltiest moment of
Trash Taste this year, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I was like, "Fuck these guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck these guys. Fuck them." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I went for a walk trying to figure out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how I'm gonna warm myself up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was great, 'cause the car </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was slightly on a hill, as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So when reclined the chair, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it was literally like a flat bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> The air blasting, 'cause it
doesn't really do anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> for the first 10 minutes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause the car wasn't moving. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was like, "What are we doing?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I'm still tired as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I start walking around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I try taking some nice photos of Fuji, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but at this point, I'm fucking dying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't give a shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You could have got in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, could've squeezed in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There was literally no space. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Could've got in the boot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every space was taken. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We could have stacked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I found my way, though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I found a way to warm myself up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So this was me using 100% of my brain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I'm an engineer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and what do engineers do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We problem solve. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did that, too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't blame you for not problem solving. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Unfortunately, I couldn't
go for the same solution, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because Nabi was fast asleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I couldn't be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Nabi, gimme the car keys." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] "Get the fuck out." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Get the fuck out.
Let's go into the car." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] "Give me the other car." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I walk over to take a piss, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to take a piss in the toilet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I see the vending machine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then like the fucking bulb
just lights above my head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, "Guys, I figured this out." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So I go back to my tent. I get my wallet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get my wallet and I just
start putting coins in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I start buying coffee. 'Cause Connor... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How many did you buy? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I bought six in the end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That sounds more inefficient
than using the car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Probably. It probably is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But that was the only
solution I could come up with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why did you not just
jump in the other car? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We had two cars. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's canned coffees by the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So to explain, we had
a vending machine there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Japanese vending
machines have this option </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where some of the drinks are warmed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That was the only source
of heat I could find </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like a five-mile radius at this point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So here I am, spending a
hundred yen for a coffee, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which to me are just
like heat packs, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I start packing them into my coat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> At this point, I actually
start rationing them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I start, so I take about six coffees, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rush back to the tent, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go back into my sleeping bag. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I throw two cans at my feet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause my feet were the coldest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The rest, I start packing
in my winter jackets. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I pack some in my bottom
pockets, some in my side, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my sleeve pockets, my side pockets; </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have the best fucking
sleep of my life, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It worked. It actually worked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got some proper air circulation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in this fucking sleeping bag, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I felt so rough the next day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I slept like 10 hours as
well. I just felt awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's something about
eating just meat, as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that just makes me feel awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I get that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And a lot of beer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We didn't have the best
diet the night before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I eat just meat, like only meat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like my body feels beaten up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I need something else
to help stomach the blow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah. Moral of the story is... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Be more prepared. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't underestimate the winter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought it would be fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who gives a shit about
what Bear Grylls says, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when you could just get warm coffee? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the secret. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just get in the car.
Just get in the car. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why did Bear Grylls not go
to the nearest vending machine? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - All you need is a konbini. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Just go to a vending machine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Get a vending machine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pack yourself some warm fucking coffee, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just use that shit. Warm yourself up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why Russians are complaining. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've seen Siberian winters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Just need a vending machine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes their car engines freeze. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't they leave the cars on sometimes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it freezes otherwise? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you also watch that video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of the dude who went to Siberia? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was it really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was that video that went viral. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was on my recommended recently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's got like 30 million views </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in six months or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of this dude who went
to Yakutsk in Siberia, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is the coldest part of the world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like -71 degrees or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Colder that Antarctica? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's colder than Antarctica, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Gotta fact check that, Ashley. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. But it it's called Yakutsk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Y A K U T S K. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where's the coldest place on Earth? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's in Siberia, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this dude does this
amazing mini-documentary </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of him there and he's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, so here I've got some
boiling water at 100 degrees, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm gonna throw it out into the air </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it'll instantly freeze." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He just throws it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] I've seen that, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Instantly turns into snow, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's like -50 degrees. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "In normal circumstances, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> if it's anywhere below zero degrees, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then school is canceled. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But here in Yakutsk, as
long as it doesn't hit -50, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kids are going to school." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. It's insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I remember seeing videos like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Let me see. Not just in Siberia, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but I think recently somewhere in America </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> had like a cold front where it was like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Oh, Texas? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was it Texas? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. Texas had... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where I saw videos of
people doing the same thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where they would throw out the water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't quote me on this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I'm not sure if it was Texas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was Texas. It was Texas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you sure? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The cold front? Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> The cold was 'cause all
the electrical grid broke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This guy Discover with
Cenet, 32 million views, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> six months ago, -71 degrees
Celsius, -96 Fahrenheit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Nabi] It's not the coldest
habitable place on Earth, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's probably one of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's one of them. It's up there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Nabi] It's one of the coldest cities. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I'm pretty sure
that Antarctica is like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. Center of the Arctic Circle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is probably colder, but
no one's living there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I would see videos of people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> throwing boiling water out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and you'd see it freeze
and steam instantly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But my favorite thing was people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who didn't realize that boiling water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is still boiling water, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and if you chuck it on yourself, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even if it's like -20
degrees weather outside, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's still gonna be some boiling water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You're still gonna burn yourself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why were people
chucking it on themselves? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They were chucking it on themselves? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - They were chucking it in the air, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and the water, you know, fell down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fell down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause how gravity works,
it would fall down on them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, "Ah! Fuck!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Let's just scald myself." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The more you know. Boiling
water is still boiling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Cold things are cold. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Camping in -4 degrees weather... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure there's gonna be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some pro camping people watching this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> cringing to death hearing all the fails, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's camping, innit? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Fucking everything up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was still fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's part of the fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's still fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure there's gonna be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some people watching be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "What? -6, -5, that's not cold." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Basic. Basic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's how it always is in these. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They'll be like, "Oh, you
woke up at 4:00 AM, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wake up at 1:00 AM every day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I inject meth into my eyes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't know what waking up early is." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Weak morning routine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, "Shut the fuck up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Let people complain about
what is relative to them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for a moment, please." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Look, all I'm saying
is Yuru Camp lied to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They went camping in the winter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they didn't need to
go into the fucking car </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to warm themselves up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were comfy in their little coats. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna see that Yuru Camp episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where's the Yuru Camp episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they become mouth breathers? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If they don't become mouth breathers, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> then I don't think it's
accurate, honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do they have clearly defined nose? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> That could be mouth breathers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, they don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - They might be mouth breathers, Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They probably are mouth breathers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're pretty mouth breathers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This episode is sponsored by Harry's. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> Go to Harrys.com/trashtaste
to try Harry's today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you guys have any irrational fears? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I don't know if I'm the only one... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - How irrational? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. What is
your biggest fear, Joey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> What is your biggest fear? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My biggest fear? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is your biggest irrational fear? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not having a great beard. I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Actually go, sorry. Sorry
to bring up the camping. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> We'll go back to the irrational fears. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We'll go back to that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The beard definitely helped staying warm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I gotta admit, now that
I've let it grow out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My face was never cold. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But didn't your snot freeze? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. So here,
'cause I had a cold, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it was so cold. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My snot, obviously it must have dribbled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> while I was sleeping. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It froze on the arch of
my, underneath my nose. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was awful 'cause I
was like, "What is this?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and flicked it and just
peeled off all my skin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Ow. Ow." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, the beard otherwise is great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I think this is the
longest I'll let it go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's getting pretty long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Does it get any longer than that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It can do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it'll keep
going longer and longer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, damn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I kind of wanna see you
with like the longer... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Part of me wants to
try it, but I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Maybe I should just save
that for when I'm bald." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, you gotta test it out
now, before you go bald. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. That's what I was thinking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - See if it works. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I'm not gonna
lie, I don't know if... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's probably a lot of
bearded people watching this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It kind of is getting
somewhat itchier than usual. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I feel that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you get this? Do you
get this, bearded people? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I get that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There are probably no solutions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are like, "How you
maintain a beard perfectly." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which I don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - One time, I grew it out
to as long as I could, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I don't think it'll
ever get as long as yours, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but I remember one time it... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm at the baby stages.
It's still growing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but that length that you have, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is probably the longest it can go for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Because my Asian side forbids it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I will say that doing
this feels really nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just be like, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you gotten to the point, though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you're kind of turning in your bed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and your beard brushes
up against the pillow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it starts to get a bit itchy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> The worst thing is, 'cause
we have to wear masks, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when it's getting thicker... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With a mask is the worst. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Masks suck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like I'm breathing
into my own beard jungle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I can feel it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's ticklish, as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It's like wet. It's awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How long are you gonna grow it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm probably gonna shave it tonight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Not all off. I'm just gonna cut it, sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll trim it down, 'cause
got a video shoot tomorrow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna be sad to stop letting it grow, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but maybe I'll try it again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You should try it. You should try it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll do it again sometime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How come you wanted to
grow it out a bit longer? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just wanted to see if
it looked better thicker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it does look a
little better thicker </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than normal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It definitely adds on
the age, that's for sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I look older. I look more angry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who doesn't look older
with a beard, though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I could probably look
my age if I grew a beard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I could see Garnt in
10 years with a goatee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna see that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt with a goatee. I could see it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think I've ever seen you with, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have you ever grown out your beard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to see where the absolute limit is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before it stops growing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, because I don't like
how I look with a beard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of the times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's this... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] I want goatee Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's this perfect sweet spot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it just kind of looks like pubes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It goes from nine o'clock shadow to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Wow, you really should
trim that bush, mate." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I always trim it when
it gets to that point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I don't know if I'm ever
gonna grow out the beard, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because Sydney's like,
"Yeah, it's a good idea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a good idea." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Then I reached the pube stage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> She's like, "Maybe you should trim it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's in-between phases that look bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - After the pube phase is
when it starts to look good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Commit, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe I will, one day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Goatee Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone has the pube stage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You have to go beyond the pube stage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He wears turtlenecks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He's literally made for goatees. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Goatee Garnt. Do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe, maybe one day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe when I reach my midlife crisis. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know how like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You'll be the first one there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I could do a goatee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I could just shave it all off and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hello, fellow goatee wearers." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did a goatee once when I was shaving, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and immediately, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh God, I look like I touch children." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was actually like I immediately, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was immediately like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Nope, I'm not having this
on my face any longer." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Calling out anyone with a goatee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - As opposed to like Shinobu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just doesn't work for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I realize I have one of those faces </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just like it's
either beard or nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like goatee, mustache... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, you're not helping yourself out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I tried the bootstrap beard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that, with
the really thin beard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I don't like those. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That doesn't work for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mustache doesn't work for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Goatee doesn't work for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's either this or nothing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just have one of
those faces, I realized. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You just have to try it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wish mustaches were more "in". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I like mustaches. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wish I could rock a mustache. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mustaches look kinda sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wish I had the face for a mustache. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They do look sick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just looks like you're
about to invent something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You look like you're
about to pioneer somewhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Depends on what kind of
mustache you have, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You could work a mustache. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't get, you know
that thing that people have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you don't grow that
much hair in the middle? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You need it to grow more there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think you would suit a mustache. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] No, I don't think so either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't think so? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I also think you'd look like
you touched short people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you wore a mustache. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt! You're giving
people with a mustache </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a bad rep here, boys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Some people can rock it so hard, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm so jealous of
people who can do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If he had a mustache
and those massive glasses, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Those massive glasses,
you would definitely... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're calling out some of our viewers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They're probably gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, but I'm sure they
don't look that bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Saying it's just my face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> My face just looks hideous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - For some people, it just works, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's no explanation for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here's a still image,
Mudan. Put a mustache on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've seen dudes with just mustaches, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just goatees, just bootstraps, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like, "Fuck.
You kill that shit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Put some glasses on him as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Put some big glasses. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Put some glasses and then you'll see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just doesn't work for some people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. Maybe it works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe it's just my imagination. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Amazing. Bet it looks amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If it looks amazing, you have to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I'd look like a '90s porn star. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that a good thing or a bad thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a great thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The 2000s porn stars, the Johnny Sins era. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So yeah, '90s is
mustaches, all that stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like '70s. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - '90s. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - '70s porn stars had
the thick thick mustache. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was a look. That was
a look. Bring it back, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe I will. Who knows? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't imagine you with a mustache. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Garnt would look like
a detective if he did it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna see Garnt with a fucking mustache. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> How long does it take for
you guys to grow out a beard? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> How much commitment does it take? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I dunno how long this has taken. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> This is taking a while. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - My max, I think, is a
month and a half, two months. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Then it hits a point where it
just won't grow any longer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a long time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It takes a long time to grow a beard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It takes a long time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Months that I don't have, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it looks scruffy in the middle parts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When it's a full beard and
I can trim it properly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, it'll look good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - When I reach my midlife crisis, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's when I'll grow a beard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're saying I reached
my midlife crisis? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Sorry? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have I reached my midlife crisis? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, maybe you have, Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I haven't got my
health check results yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe I have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you might be at midlife. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It could be three-quarters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like growing a beard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or doing something crazy
with your facial hair </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is the male equivalent of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when girls want a big change in their life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they just cut their
hair off or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like the male equivalent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I broke up, I cut my hair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We need... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I broke up. I grow a beard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We need to change the stigma. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The stigma around it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We need to change the stigma. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you grow a beard at
any point in your life, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're a sumo. You deserve it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Go. You go, bro. Get a beard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What if you can't grow a beard, though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sucks to be you, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Some people just can't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Stigma. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That doesn't mean you're
having a midlife crisis </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if you grow a beard, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You can grow facial hair
if you want to, king. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Go ahead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I grew my beard out in my early 20s. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Midlife crisis. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Midlife crisis, shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - In YouTuber years,
that is a midlife crisis. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - True. That is true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Utterly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But anyway, going back
to irrational fears. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I remember... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have we said our fears
on a podcast before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like our main fears? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We did an episode where we
talked about our fears, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Actually, it was a clickbait, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No we talked about... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What was I scared of? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Huh? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What was I scared of? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tight spaces. Or I
remember we talked about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> crawling into tight spaces. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. 'Cause you were
talking about the cave story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I remember, I just realized this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as I was taking another piss, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where most of my
irrational fears come from, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it is from horror movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Specifically from horror movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I would watch as a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that's why I detest horror movies, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most of the horror movies
I've watched in my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> are between the age of
five to 10 years old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The reason for this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every time I'd go to my cousin's house, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he'd put on a horror movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How it'd start is I'd go
around to my cousin's house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and be like, "Oh, can we
watch "Dragon Ball Z"? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Can we watch "Dragon Ball Z"?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So they'd put on "Dragon Ball Z" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'd be into it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then all the parents would go
off and do their own thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They would ask the older cousins </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to take care of the kids. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> As soon as the adults left, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were like, "Yo, you
wanna see a horror movie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You wanna see someone get butchered?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "No, that scares
me. It gives me nightmares." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How old are you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Huh? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How old are you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Between like five and 10 years old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuckin' hell. A little too young. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I remember, I think I
was seven or something... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm gonna say the irrational fear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every time I approach my car </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just in a car park, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could be empty, could be full. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I'm by myself and it's dark. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> First thing I have to
do, check the backseat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Make sure no one's in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Second thing I have to do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to go under </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and check that there's nobody
hiding underneath my car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Do you check that every time? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like 90% of the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do it because I don't
feel safe unless I do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's gonna be under your car? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Here's the reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - A monster. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here's the reason why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So when I was about, I can't remember, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> between five and seven. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I was seven years old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I go to my cousin's house,
and of course, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Garnt, it's horror movie time again." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "No, please no." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> We're putting in the horror movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This time, it's "Urban Legends". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it good? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dunno if it's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Scared the shit out of me as
a kid, I'll tell you that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, I bet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never watched it since. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You might get PTSD if you watch it now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You will overcome your fear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well maybe, maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a slasher horror movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was like '90s. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's when slasher
horror movies were in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Like the "Scream" era. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. The "Scream" era. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the horror movie
era that I grew up with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's the kind of horror
movies that traumatized me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was this guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't remember the exact
things that happened, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I remember it was surprise, surprise, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about urban legends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You'd have these urban
legends that were spread out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and sometimes these urban
legends would come true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember what the
exact urban legends were, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I remember this one scene. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a guy who was
basically dressed up as Death </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he had a scythe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I think part of the urban legend was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that there would be this
guy in the back of your car </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> while you're driving. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This actually happened in the movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There was this person driving the car </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and how he died was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone emerged from the back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with a scythe and just
chopped him up to death. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Of course, as a kid, that terrified me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I remember thinking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "If I ever grow up and
get my driver's license, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at any point in the dark, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone could come up from the back seat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and stab me in the neck
or slice my neck open." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I kind of get that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So that is just ingrained into my mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the second death in that movie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or it might be the third or the fourth, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So this rumor gets spread around, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That there's a guy in the backseat, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a serial killer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and this is how this person died. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, of course, the fourth guy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he thinks he's better than this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He goes towards his car. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's a bit scared, but what does he do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He checks the backseat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Of course, he's like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've beat the system. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ha. I beat the system. It's so dumb. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Out of nowhere, the guy is
hiding underneath the car </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and slices his ankles. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He starts crawling away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember this scene to this day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why, if I ever approach a car, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm beating the system. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> First thing I'm doing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm checking underneath the car. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Second thing I'm doing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm checking the backseat, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's no... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then what if Death's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Big plot twist, passenger seat." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look, look, look. If there's a sequel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if there's "Urban Legends 2", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where someone adds on to this system, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But until then, I'm checking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> underneath every car I go to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and every backseat, if I'm by myself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I'm not getting my ankles sliced. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll tell you that much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - How did this man, not to nitpick, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but how did he use a scythe in a car? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was this like an SUV? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mini-scythe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This must have been a big scythe, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can't swing it in a car. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The scythes are not short tools. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe a sickle, a sickle
might have worked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like how that's your
first question and not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "How did he get into the car?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The first thing I was
thinking when he said this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "How did this man
swing a scythe in a car?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I can barely swing my arms in a car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a good question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I should have asked that as a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe if he kind of put it forward </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then brought it backwards. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then how would you
slice it underneath? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a lot of ways this could go wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're being a little
too realistic here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We first have to question,
"Why is Death in my car?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's why I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was gonna be scared
until the many plot holes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that were available. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I suddenly feel a lot safer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Irrational. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like, "This is good." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like, as an adult, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can pick apart the plot holes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in a lot of horror movies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and they stop being scary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - As a kid, you're like,
"(screaming) He's bleeding! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He's bleeding! What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I get that backseat bullshit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's a lot of
Japanese horror films, as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where that's very cliche. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The other one that scares me is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I hated this because my new place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that I currently have has this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but in the bathroom, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your mirror has a medicine cabinet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the thing of you're
brushing your teeth, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and the medicine cabinet's slightly open, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you close the medicine cabinet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and then the monster
is standing behind you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Every now and then, I
have that thing where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I'm in the dark and the
medicine cabinet is open, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before I close it, I just look behind me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you actually? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you take a single
breath before you close? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You're just like, "Okay." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm kind of like, I see it open. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, (breathes out
forcefully) "Okay, I'm good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay guys, I'm good. Let's go." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I get that every now and then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't have any rituals like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to stop me from being scared
of something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think to this day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's some part about
me where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm still scared of the dark." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For whatever bullshit reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not because it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm afraid of the guy behind me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as I'm at the medicine
cabinet," or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's like, in the back of your head, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in the back of your fucked-up
imagination somewhere, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like, "This is a possibility." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like when you're sleeping, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're like, "Did
I leave my door open?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know you didn't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but now you're gonna go check. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause you're like, "I thought I did, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but I definitely didn't,
but I have to check." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right, right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's kind of like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Where you make yourself
think something is there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So now you have to check. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Otherwise you can't
stop thinking about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I've had stuff like that with, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "There could just be a monster </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the other side of the
bed if I turn around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But I won't know unless I turn around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Guess I won't turn around." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have had thoughts like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I never actually like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Put it into practice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even when I think, "Oh, I could just die </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if there was a guy standing
in my hallway with a knife." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't actually think
that he's gonna be there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I check. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You check just in case. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I know there's no way
in hell someone's there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you just have to confirm it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I also get that every now and again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's the most irrational thoughts, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where sometimes there's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you close the door and you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Maybe there's a guy on the other side. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe there's someone
in my house right now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Especially in the nighttime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you hear something in
the middle of the night, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in your living room or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, "I know
there's nothing in my house, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But what if? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What was that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What if? I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm pretty sure there's
no ghosts in my house." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm confident in my belief of ghosts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that this place isn't haunted or whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even if there might be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some haunted places in the world, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm pretty sure this
place isn't haunted, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but then what the fuck was that noise? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It could be the wind.
Definitely not the wind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, definitely the wind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Definitely not the wind. Could be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You start second-guessing yourself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. I feel that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> especially recently with
some horror games I played, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel that just resurfaced. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not until you recently
consume content like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you start to realize, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, yeah. I think I'm
still afraid of this shit." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember after I played
"P.T." for the first time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that made me so... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Hallways, lights on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Everywhere I go. I'm not
turning this shit off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck that." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so irrational. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, "Of course she's
not gonna be standing there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end of the hallway." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you ever get the irrational fear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that someone who's close
to you is not okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you just text
them, like, "Are you okay?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I get that. I get that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're like, "I had this weird dream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Just checking in that you're all right." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, "You haven't
texted me in a while. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We good? You good?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sometimes I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes you go to a night out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or hang out with someone,
and you're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "They said 10 words less
than what they usually said. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe there's something going on." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "They were blinking
a lot more than usual." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were signaling something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Morse code, maybe? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think part of the reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why I have so many lights on in my house </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is because of irrational fears like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> My mom would bollock me as a kid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause every time my mom
and dad would go out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they'd come home to a
house full of lights. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were like, "Garnt,
stop wasting electricity!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> For the longest time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think they just thought I would forget </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to turn off the lights. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I never just told them, "No,
I'm just actually scared. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But what if there's darkness? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And what if there's something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> hiding in that darkness, Mom? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't know. I'm in
this house by myself." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - In "Squid Game", they died in the dark. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You never know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What if "Squid Game"
just happens in your room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> while you're sleeping? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You have to start defending yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Try "Squid Game". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So Trash Tastes camping. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's when the lights went off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - When the fire went out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone was like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Get to the corner! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Closest weapon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did come to the realization, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not the realization, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but the appreciation of lights. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Especially camping. Especially camping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You really do appreciate lights and fire. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The appreciation of light. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, heat is pretty good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Being warm is a vital part of life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Light's pretty underrated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Just some things you just... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, clothes is
actually pretty useful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Honestly, they're pretty hot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, no shit they are, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just saying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never appreciated a hot shower more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> than after we came back
from that camping trip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor and Joey] True. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I could just turn on the hot water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and immediately just warm myself up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just like, "Damn, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This shower is hitting different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is hitting different, man." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was the best shower
and sleep I had, though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when we came back. It was so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually think that
fixed my sleeping schedule, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I've been getting
up at a reasonable time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Dude, I knocked out at like
9:00 PM. I was so done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, "I'm not
staying up. Fuck that." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Anything else you guys
wanna bring up or anything? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nope. Just wanna let you
know that, no clickbait. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In this episode, we did
actually almost die twice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Three times, if you include </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the surprise attack from the bush. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt was this close to death </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from a surprise Jason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Almost died from getting
scared by his own piss stream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just saying, I love you, cuz, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but fuck you at the same time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for literally giving me... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You have an asshole cousin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's so cruel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love my cousin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was he a teenager? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Huh? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was he a teenager? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's seven years older
than me. So he's... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah, a teenager.
That's the asshole part. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's the closest thing I
have to an older brother, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and thinking back, that's a
very older brother thing to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is a very older
brother thing to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love you, cuz. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You are like an older brother to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also fuck you for showing me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> all those horror movies as a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, it's so terrifying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember one thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for some reason that sticks out my mind, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> my older brother teaching me was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "You know what socks are for, right?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "No, what are socks for?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, "To clean up the messes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you spill on the floor." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "Oh, what?
That makes a lot of sense." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like when you're holding a cup of tea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you spill it on the floor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just step on it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Step on it. Just use your sock. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dunno if that's the dumbest thing ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or if it's an actual life-hack. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was like, "You know
what? That's kind of big brain." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's kind of big brain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If it's not a big spill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Obviously, if it's big, don't
just start putting your... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's an awful piece of advice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's not. It's a
little bit. Little spill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you have some thick socks, too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There is nothing worse than wet socks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, for like a brief
moment. Your body heat... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How much water are we talking about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - A tiny bit of spillage, like
a cup of tea or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then you rub it on the carpet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to warm it up and dry it off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If it's a spill that
you can actually feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on your foot, on the sole of your foot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do, for a brief moment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I still do it to this day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But hey, the floor's clean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like kicking ice under the fridge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When you spill ice, you
kick it under the fridge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> The ice thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I don't do it
anymore, but I used to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't you put it in the sink? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you drop the ice
while you're popping it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, it depends on
how much ice comes out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, two or three cubes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Just kind of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Get it under there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just kick it under. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just damage the floor, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did your brother teach you that as well? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I did that myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what you're gonna teach your kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you get home. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hope my kid never watches Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Son, five-minute
life-hack, kick the ice." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is a Trash Taste life-hack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is reverse
life-hacks, you shouldn't do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You think I'm gonna ruin
FamilyMart socks like that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're gonna put them in the wash after. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's 'cause you have white. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I only have black socks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, that's your
life-hack right there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, just buy black socks. Don't think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Does that mean you don't
own FamilyMart socks? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey tsks) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm fine with not doing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm happy with my socks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like having black socks.
I don't have to think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - If FamilyMart brought
out a black sock variant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then I might. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - FamilyMart, I hope you're listening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, you do need some black socks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey? Joey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Looking at you, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? I have black socks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know. You just never wear them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I never wear them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I swear to God, every
picture that's been taken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> within the past month, I see
FamilyMart socks poking out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> no matter the outfit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I deadass have about nine
pairs of FamilyMart socks, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I just cycle through it every week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Their poor supplier of
socks is working overtime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude. They're amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Poor factory workers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Please bring out a black pair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Working overtime to have to
sustain Joey's sock demand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just going back to a random thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I gotta ask you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So you hear something in
the living room, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe you're half asleep.
How does Aki handle that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - She's like, "Go to the living room." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - She asked you to check it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She's like, "Sweetie,
can you go check it?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Woman, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Why am I the one to go? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're the one that's curious. You go." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I hate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I'm not scared
until they ask me to check, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I feel like their fear
gets transferred over to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Before that I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, I guess something knocked
over in the living room." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just a piece of wind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then I hear, "Garnt!
Garnt, I hear something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hear something in the living room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Garnt, go check it. Garnt." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Sydney, it's probably nothing." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Garnt, I need you to go check it now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Fuck me." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Now that I'm going to
check, now I'm like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then "Resident Evil" music
starts playing in my head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, "Oh my God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a zombie in the living room." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then I have to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I'm going to check the living room, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> even if I know it's nothing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have to find a possible
weapon, just in case. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just in case. Just in case, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I have to find something that I can smack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a possible animal or person with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just in case. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just in case. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - An animal? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't know what it could be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Smack a ghost. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If it's an animal, I'm near certain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you would hear a lot more noise. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It would probably be breaking everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe they're sneaky. I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's how I discovered
the cockroach from last week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do your houses have chimneys? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You ever slept in a house with a chimney? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - They make a lot of noise. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do they? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Unsettling noises. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Howling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I did live in house with
the chimney as a kid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was blocked up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but it still made like the
(imitates wind howling). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - When it's open, the
noises that those make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> are fucking terrifying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like a wolf howling all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey howls) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's literally the
stereotypical ghost noise. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It could be pretty scary sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What if it's not the wind? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What if it's just a bunch of ghosts? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It could be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Let me in." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's cold." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's from all the
ghosts from all the Garnts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that got killed in bushes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor makes shivering ghost noise) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I need the statistics of how many people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> have been killed while
pissing next to a bush. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just need to put my mind at ease. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm gonna bet that most of the deaths </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are from electric fences
and them peeing on them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Probably something like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or an animal coming out or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a bear coming out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Animals comes through.
"What do you want?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. That's what
I'm worried about, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm worried about an animal
coming out or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You'll hear it. You'll hear it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You'll hear it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If it's big enough to kill you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you will hear it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not gonna be like, "Mah." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, but how do I distinguish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> between an animal ruffling the bushes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and just the wind? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The wind is very different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's very different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The wind is constant, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but an animal is like
(loud skittering sound). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You will see it violently moving. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You'll see it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Even though you are there,
you'll see it on the top. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Jurassic Park" has taught me different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Jurassic Park" ain't shit, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a great movie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's not giving you survival tips. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't go out into the bush and think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, shit. What if a
Velociraptor comes out?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You think you'll find Jason in Hokkaido? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Could be. I'm used to England, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We have nothing to be
scared of in England. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whenever I'm in another country... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Japanese policeman, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> randomly stopping you in
the middle of a field, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> asking you to be checked, as opposed to... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have an irrational
fear of Japanese policeman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> coming out of the bush. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, you can't be here." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have more chance
of a Japanese policeman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stopping you from peeing in a bush </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> than you do from an animal
or something killing you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd rather get arrested </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> than violently murdered by an animal, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's all I'm saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't want to be
caught with your dick down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and a flashlight shining on you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That is not what you want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's been our irrational
fears on Trash Taste today. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know who hasn't died
from peeing in the bush? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Our patrons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or they have been. We don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Look at all these people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Look at all these people
that haven't almost died. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe you have, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. Maybe something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe you've escaped death. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The backseat of the car. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tell us your near-death experiences </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the comments down below. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also, tell us your irrational fears. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you check the backseat
of the car before going in? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you check underneath the car? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Garnt's trying to find some way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Please. Please, I can't be the only one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't be the only one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who has a weird ritual in my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just because of some movie I saw as a kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I can't forget. </SPEAKER_01>
