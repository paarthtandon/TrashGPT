<SPEAKER_03> years cuz I mean when we decided we were </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> were even before that the idea of just </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> we us three and maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even a guest you never know comes onto </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the show and we basically talk about our </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trash taste whether it comes to anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> manga just otaku culture in general or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you never know we might talk about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever the [ __ ] we want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who knows yeah cuz if you didn't know we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> are all like anime youtubers yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know this guy called the anime man this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> guy called c-dog bar which God bow yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that too fast and Virginia is all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> comments from Virginia it's okay cuz the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> amount of years that I still get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> comments which is like they call me geek </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> UK and not get up I mean listen people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> might call you Kiki okay but I still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know you as the an amazing okay in but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the thumbnails in the old thumbnails </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's how I knew I was watching an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime zone I'm actually curious how long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have you been watching my videos because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this ties into how we first met as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I've known you I mean I obviously as I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> said I've known you since at the animes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on it that's like that's the line so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a long time but I think I like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I watched you probably not knowing that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you will like this like YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> personality because yeah yeah Sam yeah I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like cuz I was in like a weird state I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't think I discovered youtubers until </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe about 2011 yeah because they've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> been around for a long time since then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and obviously you've been around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> since then but I never like went onto </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube being like I'm gonna go check </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> out my favorite YouTube I couldn't just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> use YouTube up until around 2011 I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just use youtubers to like either </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watch music all this in the music videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or just to like oh this is an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interesting looking video yeah and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> think a couple of your videos will like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the interesting looking ones I think I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember actually the first video I ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watched from you surprisingly was not a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> verb ridged oh sure I watched saver </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bridge when I like the idea of an like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> breeding that sounds fun but tedious is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fun but um no I think the first video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what from you was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I probably want to say it's the size </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> review oh my god like the one you didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like mm I never even saw your IVA </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> aver a bridge yeah I just excited watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Davis I was like why would i watch the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> upper I don't even know what this is why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would I watch that so I think I watched </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> some of your stuff I just knew you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always the British one yeah my brand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that was like it was like Tristan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you in my mind I think that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it to a lot of people when yes when I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> got into it like 2013 I stopped watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTube alone especially anime stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah but they're so how long have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you been doing YouTube for I've been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing it since 2007 oh he's like an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> actual OG I'm like I'll have to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trace back but I'm think I'm like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fifth ever anime youtuber Wow of all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time might be like fourth or fifth but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been there since the beginning I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can recite the entire history of a knee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tube which we're definitely gonna do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with this episode because there there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot to say but now like I remember the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> first I can't remember what the exact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first video I saw from you Joey but I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember your video is just getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recommended to be constantly and I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like my first thought was how has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no one taken to handle the anime I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> been on YouTube for so many [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> years and just now someone is called the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> animate there's no [ __ ] no but the thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is some what did take the handle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> animator oh because that's why like like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> even my like my YouTube URL and like my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Twitter and everything it's the anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> man but so and I it's a 1 because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> somebody like Facebook Twitter Instagram </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like YouTube someone took the anime man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like this guy who never uploaded </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> any videos haha and he's been arrested </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 2007 yeah it's always just like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> man you are such a son of a [ __ ] so I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like well what am I gonna do alright </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] one somehow that caught on I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know yeah [ __ ] but yeah I mean I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> regret that name I mean it works for SEO </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> verow because the reason I was called </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the anime zone is because back in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> day when you could just type in anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was just all my videos I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> man I've won this game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm playing the game correctly and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I came along a hold my beer exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you're in this arm I'm the man but I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember the first time I was I mean I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't think I ever saw one of your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> videos the first time I heard about you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Connor was actually when you auditioned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for one of my bridge series so really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yes I haven't told you story to Joe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I did a casting call for one of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in minutes videos right and I told </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> people to send in their demo trying to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> remember what this was yeah and so I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> asked people to send in their demo reel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and most people send in their demo reel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this and this guy this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't even send in a demo reel he just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sends in a YouTube video of him doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> League of left leg of legend character </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why you should also never do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yourself yeah don't do that we're gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> someone asked for demos send a demo reel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah no I think at the time I didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have a character demo reel chief I still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> don't have a character demo reel because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I never needed it okay his things well a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of character demos on Twitter you'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hear them they're really really bad yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the thing is when you're making it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yourself you don't have anyone to say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like hey this voice kind of sucks so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like every time I've made a professional </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> demo I've had like a director who's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> hand shows and every scene and told me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what to do yeah and then it sounds good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because someone who can hear your voice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and be like I'll do this and that but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back then I didn't know that and this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was before I started doing a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> professional staff in that yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> great way to introduce yourself or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone this is okay this is also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another thing you shouldn't send a demo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to someone if it's garbage cuz you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna like this guy still remembers that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] I remember because he was the only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> person who didn't send a demo reel or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just sent a YouTube video of him doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> impressions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Melisande like if there is a like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> checklist of things not to say our demo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> do not send character impression that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> such a big that's such a big do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> remember which characters he did I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I think they were like I was just a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> bunch of the manly guys from League of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Legends just anyone with a low voice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah oh no it's like it's been awesome </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> seeing you how far you've come from yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in a character impression real to you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like that was like I that must have been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like a year or two after I started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well and I still like you think that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you figure stuff out after a year but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you realized when you look back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you've still you didn't know [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because what year did you start YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ah YouTube I started 2015 2015 2015 2015 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I started voice acting really in like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 2013 late 2014 so that gave me a big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like advantage I went into it with like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> full through the end until I got enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on my chest but pretty bad it was pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] bad at the time it was the first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time I ever used the green screen in my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like because I was in like my tiny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bedroom in Australia yeah there was no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> place to like prop up the green screen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah what I had to do it so get her what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to do was I had to get the green </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> screen and literally like tape it to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ceiling no I've done exactly the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing and like I had no light so you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> see my shadow [ __ ] flickering in and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out the whole video I only could entrap </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at the time I'm a little bit better now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah it was a what was it it was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> light no it was L from Death Note versus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Lelouch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from code right I remember I played </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> louche and another friend of mine played </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> L know and I think the video has like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> half a million views </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how yeah I mean this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back when it was like epic Rap Battles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of History yeah that's like 2015 YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but basically like that kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> somehow pulped off on my channel and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> then yeah and then because I actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was riding that with grey fox at the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> time yeah amazing guy yeah and I thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like we had it we had like a banger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> we had like so many like grey fox had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> made the tracks for many beads and they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were playing amazing and sending emails </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's such a Boomer way to slide into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> something I mean now it's Twitter not to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mention we added each other on skype and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> then I think like your Skype account got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> hacked or something that uh I know I met </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you but it was weird cuz I think Sydney </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we I saw Sydney was following me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's not my fiancee yeah Anna I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think it followed her backs I knew of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Sydney and then Sydney a DM me she'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say that she didn't Sydney DM me first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she was like you going to MCM which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is a convention in London yeah okay and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then Sydney was like oh come come to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this meet up you can meet me and gone I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't get to meet gone who's too busy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I turned up like an idiot was like hi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like c-dawg </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and stuff and everyone at the time I had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 200k subscribers here's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> substantial amount yeah that time period </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was funny because you had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> audience that was vastly different from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> their every other enemy still like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's gone like a lot lesser at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time in around 2000 the peak of it at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 2014 I had a 93 percent female audience </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> he was just like standing next to two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] skyscrapers well we're just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hanging out and I remember looking at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you and you look to me and we didn't say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] to each other and I thought this I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought this [ __ ] must hate me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this [ __ ] hates me and that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the same time I like a gun I like looked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at each other in the eyes and in my head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like this guy definitely hates me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this guy hates my guts so I'm just like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> it was like very small yeah and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what like fast forward like what two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> years I think it was just I think it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> next year we might you might have been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even less than that when I came to Egypt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> went on to a trip to Japan or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you randomly deemed me yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah like for some reason he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> follows me so maybe she doesn't hate me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> oh cool he's cool so yeah we sweet TMZ </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> chowder and then we met in Japan and </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> izakaya and Elena yeah yeah it's all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like ridiculously missed the last room </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> like I thought you hated me and I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like I thought you ate at me yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then after that we had like a karaoke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nights where we yeah I think was like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> few days later yeah and I think that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when the seeds of the podcast was sown I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think because we were up to we missed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> last train and we were just with karaoke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with each other and Sydney and there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like two other people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then everyone else had fallen asleep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was just us to one other guy it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like it was like 5:00 a.m. he didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know who we were like he didn't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we were like anime youtubes or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything huh so we're up at 5:00 a.m. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> drunk as [ __ ] and then me and Joey just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> start hosting this panel for this one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guy karaoke microphone age like welcome </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to yeah he didn't know who we were but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we still just host this anime panel for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> him I don't name I didn't even know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he watched anime or not but I'm like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dear Joey what's your opinion on Bucky </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Monica true who is best girl like an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hour then after that we were like we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> need to host a panel together yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we managed to do that last year ax which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was first time that was amazing yes yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like two three years in the making and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in between that we were like surely we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> gotta make a podcast and here we are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> after [ __ ] what three or four years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah from like first conception yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like even like planning this whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> podcast out as well like toke up very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> very long time because this is actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a studio for it yes so we have to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> get our own studio as you can see as you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> can see we're still working on it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> working on it but give us some time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stick just like getting a studio in in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan oh my god you're Toki oh my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] god don't even get me started on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> how hard that was okay I'm sure we can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> talk about in future or experiences with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just renting yeah stuff in Japan my god </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> bear yeah no I you know what's funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you guys are like you said like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just click like that after you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> start talking it's so like I think that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> happens easily when you're both like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around the same like sub thing because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no question if you're trying to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> leech off each other right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I remember like when I when I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first started and when I was trying to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it like when we were like first like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hanging out I always feel like man they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wonder if I'm she's like a leech </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd like a hundred and fifty two hundred </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they had like million-plus right so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just get this thing in your head you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like my anime leeching do they think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that but then like when you get like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think now I don't give a [ __ ] because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like I I'm here I mean like concerning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you and I yeah we popped off very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> naturally because spoiler we never ended </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up doing that no battle yeah yeah it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just like disappeared because I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think the first time I like publicly did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something with you yeah was on your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stream yeah yeah you do broforce </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> together for like three yeah there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> still a pond on new to bar really yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they all yeah yeah yeah and then I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> we just I played a lot of games on your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> stream with you and then I think we just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hung out at ax and you just went and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> then obviously play like Metal Slug [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my oh yah metal slugs on like my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> favorite game and then I think we just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> did British things and I feel like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so easy to befriend other British people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cuz it's just like we just get it I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know no like going off to what you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> said about feeling like you're leaching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> from something yeah it's it's weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right because you can as someone who's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> been in the position of you know not you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know being a smaller youtuber and a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> larger youtuber it's you can kind of get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a sense just from meeting a person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> especially if you meet them in real life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> right online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so [ __ ] difficult as true to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gauge what a character what someone's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> character is actually like and you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if they're trying to you know leech off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know get clout or whatever but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> especially at a event like ax where the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> real person comes out yeah yeah yeah you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> can definitely get a better judge of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> character at a convention or meeting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone in real life yeah a big event </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like ax </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think there's I'm also a lot with that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is that when you're at ax I think some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people think okay I've only got five </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes with this guy you've got to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> befriend him yeah so they I think they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like sometimes they go overboard with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like trying to impress you where it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like I mean one thing I've noticed with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when it comes to like cuz I've been to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so many conventions where like people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have come up to me just for that like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> five minutes that they have time with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> somebody yeah so I just I don't want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say kiss us but you know when someone's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to kiss ass here yeah all like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like the thing is is that like at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> least earlier on when I would meet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people like that and they're trying to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> be nice to me during those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> five minutes I didn't know if they were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just trying to kiss my ass or if there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were genuinely nice people yeah but the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one way I found it is if they can I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> guess like main try and maintain that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> friendship with you and try and stay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> contact with you after that event then I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> think they're like genuinely nice people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah because I I don't want to make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it sound like we all [ __ ] arseholes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you think I'm talking with hearing about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> how you just message cornerback from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just that one email yeah I also remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the point when I would just try to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talk to everyone in class yeah but then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you get to a point when you see that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ninety percent of these emails in ninety </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> percent of these people talking to you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> don't actually mean what they mean or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looking for something and you get a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sense force you get a sense for that as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> time goes by so it's it's I feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just glanced at an email now and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> know actually here's a question for you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's the way I know you've got some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stories of this Connor Oh God </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what does someone like the weirdest fan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> emails you've ever received I get them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every week right I'd like to say every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> week but it's like I've gotten somewhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like I think like I'm actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scared to open it even though there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like no attachments no links or anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but even a subject title it's literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just I open it and it says you're cool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> open an email like that and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> midnight is like the scariest [ __ ] ever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because I'm just like did my computer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just get hacked I don't know if this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like an elaborate like trojan or or if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like a ten-year-old who's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> learning to use an email for the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> time like I'm like thanks but when they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just send a link that's cool it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah man I don't know I've got so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> many stories I guess of emails because I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guess it's my fault because I kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> encouraged it a little bit yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've made multiple videos where I've got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> content from my email sometimes it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good but then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I think now since I've joined an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> agency I feel bad for the agency where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they sometimes I get said luckily I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> normally like delete the ones that I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know I like like just trolling the for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by agency you can see it because I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want some Japanese worker opening my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> email and it being like hey I think your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dummy thick and I'm 13 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like you get stuff where they'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say like they they want to date you and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll put their 13 and like that it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like is this Christmas in is Chris </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Hansen emailing yeah I think I've spoke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> about this in a video once but there was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a someone who emailed me and I still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember this cuz like I hadn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interacted to it and it was this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interaction where they sent me a script </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of phone sex that we were gonna have so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like it was like what I actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> still have the script I'm not gonna read </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it out cuz there's more to the story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that there's the reason why I decided to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not make it into a video yeah but it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a script and it was it was first it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was one script was me and her and there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was also a music setlist that she'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chosen so there was when the music was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like pour some like sugar on me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> oh my you know like the cheesiest song </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and so I thought in my head cause back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then I read all of them in depth and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> thought wow this is a video idea if I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> can like is going right and there's also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> another script where as me having gay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sex with the sebastian michaelis of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> course of course I mean that would be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> expected funny that's like not the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> weirdest story I'm surprised you didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> make a video Wow okay so here's why and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel bad I hope this person isn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> watching so I interacted with them a bit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were like obviously I knew they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> were gonna be strange right because ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sends an email like that yeah and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> start interacting with them more and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more and then they started sending me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> way too much information about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> themselves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's also another guy who sent me is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> birth certificate by the way that's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whole nother what oh don't do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> turn that stage don't do that I didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> ask for his opening email was his my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> birth ticket driving license address and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like what is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I also mentioned this I don't know which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> video I said I just mentioned all this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah so I replied to this person I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kept replying with them because they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kept replying with really funny stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah I was like oh my god I can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> get an amazing video out of this yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and then with the one thing they said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which made me think okay now I just have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to like completely scrap all this is </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> friends and everyone's like no don't do </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> girlfriend was like genuinely worried </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for you is like I really don't think I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> watch the video they felt more concern </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> actually don't get that many weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> emails or weird fan mails yeah I don't </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> like one weird email ago recently which </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> yeah so get used to it yeah so that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't imagine our intro was gonna be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that long ago in my head I was like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] finally I think it would you guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> will say that attack on Titan season 4 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is your most anticipated Absa follow me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> absolutely absolutely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> how do you even match that hype at this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> point it's like exeed it's uh it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> meant to be airing this fall I think oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this summer I believe it was definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was wrong but yeah I think it's I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty sure it's airing it was scheduled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to air next fall and I've heard from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I made a video about the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three seasons of attack on Titan and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've heard from pretty much everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who's read the manga that season 4 is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to be the best season oh no I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> even if it was just mediocre I feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it we'd still like just think it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing because like the journey to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there it's been yeah and this last part </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was oh my god oh my god like it's so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> rare that you get to see a series just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> improve over time every season because I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember when attack on Titan season 1 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was airing right and I was it was great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was great but I felt like it was very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> forgettable in a sense of well I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember when season 2 aired I didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember anything that happened in you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know what I remember specifically in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your video of their like season or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> review you said remember their attack on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Titan and then you just play cricket </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> noises and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and our IRA be like well I'm watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> attack on Titan season 2 is good I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like I know I do agree that the like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> season 2 cuz season 1 when I watched it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like the high prisons yes and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> season 2 came around and actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> dropped it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no one cares because yeah because I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think I think what it was was that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because season 1 was you know all about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the action and just like building </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the world and yet season 2 was a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> politics and a lot of talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah season 2 just took the pace cuz </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> season 1 was like a [ __ ] roller </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coaster you were going up and down every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> few episodes it's like you didn't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what was gonna happen but you to me felt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a bit empty and season 2 you felt much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> slower paced it was more of like a slow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> burn when they focus more on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> characters yeah but I actually got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really drawn into the world way more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into season 2 but by the time Caesars </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> who ended I was like okay I'm now way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more invested but nothing really big has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> happens yeah yeah I think everyone was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like what the [ __ ] we've waited four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> years or something twelve well because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they rushed it out yeah I mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely I think in season three when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that scene would leave I came out yes I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> think when it just explode yeah yeah cuz </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone saw that gif on Twitter I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like I got a [ __ ] catch-up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> okay see this is insane like just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking about that scene like gives me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> goosebumps it's so good because I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> remember season three part one I enjoyed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so [ __ ] much show cuz I didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realize I could care about the politics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that much in attack on Titan because I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember by the time season 3 started I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was enjoying attack on Titan for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> completely different reasons than season </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one here on I mean III can say the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> thing about every season so I've heard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> season four is going to be completely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> different complete - what's previously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> been because I mean like it was but me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and Aki went to the attack on Titan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exhibit mmm that they did in Roppongi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and basically it was really tough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because what what they did was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> essentially they really catered to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> manga readers unfortunately yeah and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> am NOT the manga Rita so in like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> later rooms of the exhibit they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically like on all the walls they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would have liked the original Ganga of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the manga right right in these frames </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> which is [ __ ] cool yeah but then as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you got further down the exhibit they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would start showing stuff that hadn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> been adapted yet right so I was like but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously there was just some stuff that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't really avoid see yeah and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tiny little bits that I did see out of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> context I was like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Wow there was no [ __ ] way that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happening and then to top it off there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was this room this was like a really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experimental move on them their part but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was this room that you had to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into and it was a completely pitch black </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> room yeah and there's just audio playing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the speakers in this pitch-black room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and what that audio is is it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> audio of what sa AMA envisions the final </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chapter or the tack on time to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no visuals there's no visuals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just audio and it's what he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> envisions it will sound like all of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the only thing occurred was a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like background noises like ambient </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> noises yeah and and mikasa yelling aaron </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> from a long way away okay that could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> mean anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean like I'm obviously not looking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the audio justice but it's can we get a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> one-to-one reenact but I mean I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously not doing the audio justice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it sounded like when I when I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like closed my eyes and heard that I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like wow I've never been more excited </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for an anime in my life it's good to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know that the anime and the manga will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> end with Mikasa screaming Eren a spoiler </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> has done for the entire [ __ ] series I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> mean is that I mean it with the track </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> record the attack on Titan house right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now I mean it's I mean every episode you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could argue it's been really good right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean this story's just been there's no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like faults in the story so far right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's holding up pretty well yeah I'd say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's had been building on its story riot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> really well really really well like what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if this if they nailed this ending what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like category is this in a flight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> masterpiece master what what would you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put it is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like anime in the same category man if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it killed that this last season like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this could even be in its own thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we're like no anime is like as good I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> would say that's that's not to say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a big statement right yeah but I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean I'm just trying to think how many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like how many anime series have there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been where it's stretched out for I mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> over 50 episodes over 50 episodes like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> let's say four or five seasons and has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like killed it this hog yeah I would say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it'd be similar to something like Full </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Metal Alchemist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Hunter hunter although I'd say it's I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> haven't seen full metal alchemist my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> fanbase knows this it's a big [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> meme but Full Metal Alchemist is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one anime that I haven't seen we all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> have that one anyway I just when I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about it I you know hunter hundreds I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> mean hasn't ended there which is pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I couldn't argue that's it's in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> same class but I guess full malakas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Brotherhood maybe you could yeah because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you never know like hunter and I might </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm hoping yeah but you never know but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> hunter hunter might end up like a Hugh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hockshop yeah I think that's the problem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is that I think everyone's got kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beginning to accept that slowly oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the world is just especially now with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the Dark Continent which you know it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> load of stuff with Hunter hunter but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's looking like it's even more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> ambitious than before and he's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> releasing chapters no a very slow it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's is gonna take a whole lifetime to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> catch up but going back to attack on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Titan I think I called it like if it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> even if it was off the quality of season </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 3 part 2 yeah and it all ended in that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quality it would be a modern classic oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for sure my sure yeah if it's even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> better than that I have no [ __ ] clue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but that makes me so excited yeah the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> fact that we might be yeah he's just I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> think the last time I was possibly that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> excited for like a follow-up was one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> punch man season 2 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> okay I've watched a few clips recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up one punch man season 2 and he's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't that bad I think it's just a wish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> set our expectations disgustingly hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it wasn't bad it was painfully mediocre </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like seven deadly sins season one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it like so what I'm hoping what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm hoping is that the net </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> season assuming we get another one at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> one punch man is that it doesn't go my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> god bat [ __ ] is still I like I haven't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> seen any of seven deadly sins I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know anything about it never read the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> manga never enemy but not gonna lie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a part of me when I saw footage </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of season 3 yeah I was like I kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to watch this now just to see it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> devolve into this current state I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember cuz the fight that they [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> up was one of the most likes it was one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of the most hyped fights and then they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] it up so much that fan animation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of that fight that was released before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looked better than the official but when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I found out about that scene is someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put it up on Twitter and had to preface </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it by saying no this is not a fan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> animation this is the official episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because everybody in that tweet was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is this fan made it's like some guy who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like just learn how to use flash like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> week ago just you know what sticks on my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mind that kick the kick when I give </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> first came and I saw the kick which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you'll probably see you on screen right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now I [ __ ] lost it like I don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd ever like I've watched all of seven </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> deadly sends up at that point and like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't like a huge fanboy but every time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a new season was announced of the OVA </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd watched yeah I never so quickly lost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> interest in a series just from seeing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that one screenshot melio dislike I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like what did they do to him we've never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seen anything like has that happened in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime before like where as season is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like so drastically like [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> change Studios and lost I'm sure like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know I know there have been and I know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to kill myself for not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remembering I like what this is but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's been so many times that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because the difference forces when it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happened back then is that there wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Twitter and when it happens now oh you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know when it happens exactly it was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like a bunch of light we'll talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like [ __ ] like the only thing I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> can think of right now is like off the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> top of my head is berserk or jaw which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it'll mean it's changed studio but it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was technically a continuation okay okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay what's worse that berserk the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> second adaptation of berserk or the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> seven deadly sins the new season yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay because I mean like you know I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> saying that from like a heart called </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> beserk fan I haven't heard the manga so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yes because if you'd read them if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> read the manga I'm sure everybody who's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> read the manga can agree with this but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like I have never wanted to like cry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from sadness I'm like how could they do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> my boy guts like that am i I've because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the berserk adaptation was just a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> failure on pretty every level every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> level from like the animation which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone likes points out boy like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> composition the sound design I mean if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you hear if you heard that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what sound it's just what how did you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> get this who did you hire to be honest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] came up with that sound like how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> do you see this big [ __ ] iron sword </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and just like let's pull out a cowbell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> do you ever do a Jojo make everything a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> gun show yeah every every honestly can I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> talk about Jojo sound design I love Jojo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sound design so much cuz soun design is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> something that people don't normally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talk about you know and you don't you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't you don't really you don't release </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> his hair people who it's like voice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happening right well it's done well you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't notice yeah so with Jojo sound </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> design it's one of the few shows where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you hear if you hear like a sound you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know some judges you you know that you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know the exact stands and you know the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like sometimes it's the exact episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the exact fight because they're yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're that recognized one that they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like not generic at all and I [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> love Jojo sound design cuz the reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why I think the anime is as good as is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the reasons is that the sound </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> design is so [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like have you guys seen the I assume you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guys have seen the Jojo Oh peas where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they add the sound so cool I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why they don't do that for the the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> airing versions I mean it's it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> really what you see in an ope right it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is pretty unconventional but I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's so many sounds that you could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> say like I quite okay when you hear that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that gunshot for the punch you know it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a Jojo pan yeah yeah and it makes it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sound so meaty it's great oh I love how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the punching sounds like every time you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> know like this like a muda or like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it is almost like gum like yeah I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> sure it's like gunshot yeah yeah it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> gunshot like and then obviously there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> a lardo timestop which I feel like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> almost become the universal sound of you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know I mean if you talk musical oh my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> god the new season absolutely killed it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like I think I think super ripe are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 12 John said this and in his review of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> golden wind and I feel the same way like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this is gone wind was the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> adaptation of a Jojo where I think the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you know so much when you take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> away that sound and especially the music </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you hear that journos theme come on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> oh you're a sweetheart </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Jonah's theme is one of the few tracks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in anime that has been memed to death it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is and I have no part I have more gotten </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> bored of it that's that's all outside </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> here but you like every version I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> heard of joiners theme of equally just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> be tight it's like a piano version metal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> version I don't care it's always been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry like when when we can go back to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the gym some of the best music to Pearl </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're working out is JoJo's it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> works so well and I know it should work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well but man when the piano hits you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing an extra rep no matter how tired </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you are you're doing that extra rep it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> almost too hype sometimes there yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like oh [ __ ] I gotta keep doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this rapper I'm dying right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know my boy Jojo down making of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anime adaptations though there is one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> topic I would like to color because it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is quite timely yeah but just yesterday </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually reporting over as of us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recording this episode I found or I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> guess Aki found that somebody is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> adapting killing stalking you mean it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not a big deal this is the biggest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> opting killing stalking you mean when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> andaman you mean it's not an official </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime adaptation like everyone on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Twitter thinks it is okay just like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most is the original Twitter post that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> blew this up said an official adaptation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and then in the replies to that tweet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they double down saying it yeah it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all official but the thing that caught </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my eye is the picture that everyone was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> retweeting alright three pictures of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this tweet one of them there's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> chaos ops ops yeah so yeah so like cuz </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kisaki found that on a timeline and was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like holy [ __ ] they're making us killing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> slowking item adaptation I'm like really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let me see and I saw the pictures I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the first two legit yeah oh yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like coming soon 2020 I was like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] okay and then I looked at the last </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one and it was like k ops ops to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> might yeah yeah right who what is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> student I legitimately had to look it up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on Wikipedia being like a baby's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> one of them cuz you know recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they've been so many [ __ ] Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime studio yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> come out with like ridiculous name so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like I was probably just one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> those exactly I looked it up and I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like no it's literally just one dude one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> dude but I feel bad for this derivative </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> making this cuz like my god the amount </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of hikes they just got thrusted on them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everyone's assuming this just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> legit yeah I mean how did the hype just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happen did they just literally just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> between just the two it yeah but the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> original tweet I think as of us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> recording I think has like forty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thousand likes and like 20 thousand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> retweets or something Wow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because killing stalking fans are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> dedicated and also the thing was the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> song Laura and the replies to that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people weren't questioning whether like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was legit people what you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> questioning should it get an adaptation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no it's the main argument I think that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why it was getting so many I think you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> should get an adaptation I mean let me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> let me chase the question have you guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> read it I've read the first like what is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it like cuz it came out like stories </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right like seasons I said I watched I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> read the first season and I quite liked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it and you know it's a lot but I feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like from what I've heard as well it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> handles it quite well towards the end </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I I did a video on it I actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> looked back on when I did my video of it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> almost four years ago holy [ __ ] was it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that long ago yeah I remember you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> releasing that like years ago and that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because I only reviewed the first season </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because I think the series ended like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like lost year yeah but there's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a huge gap right so I've only really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seen or read like the first half of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was you know it was marketed as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh it's a really hardcore like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gruesome Yowies yeah you know all these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fan girls getting on it and I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay I mean I don't know if I'm gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> enjoy it as much because I'm not exactly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the target demographic but I'll give it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a go and it was like a genuinely good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> story like yeah it had Yowie elements in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it but you know I'm an adult I can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> handle that yeah other than that if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> take away the young elements it's just a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really really good horror mystery but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I saw that they were gonna make a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> quote-unquote anime adaptation for it I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like I don't I don't because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately what I thought of is all of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these other like over sexualized series </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting anime adaptation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recently because as someone who hasn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> read it seems like it's a very sexual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> story that would have to be heavily said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is is well I think it also has such </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like its divided a lot of community cuz </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think a lot of people really sexualize </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it yeah when it's just a really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up dynamic yeah and a lot of I mean a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of a really deep [ __ ] of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> possessiveness and and all that but if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're thinking about reading it it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a lot like going to it with caution </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely be here for the huge of 80 we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to legally say I mean I I think you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> should read it but then also like I can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> totally recommend you not to read it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's your life would be totally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> fine if you don't read it yeah maybe I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> love the anime instead talking about the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> anime like I said affiliate I feel bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the this person because a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people are putting a lot of hype on it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also what I saw it's a one-man job </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like these guys doing everything and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know if it's a guy or girl but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they seem to be in charge of they seem </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be 3d modelers I think what that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trade is and I saw the voice-acting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> casting call and as someone who's you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know done a lot of voice acting casting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> calls I've made my own I've worked with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of professional ones like it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> not normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd say I don't even know I don't - </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because they I don't think they're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that experience and I think other voice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actors are helping them with it but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first of all normally you don't name </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> who's gotten what role publicly right so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on this casting call document which I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think we even maybe show on screen for a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> second it says like one person who has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the role and it's showing publicly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's not normally the case normally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just here are the lines audition </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for it more yeah and the way it's laid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out is really odd and it's just over I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> mean over Twitter isn't that weird but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no mention of pay or anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I guess I mean it is a fan-made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> project but normally still you you say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if it's paid or not yeah you normally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> say how you know how many lines they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna be it just I don't know it looks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like it belongs on like casting call </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Club which is an amateur voice acting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> website yeah which makes me uneasy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because if it is gonna be a USB </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> microphone kind of deal it's not gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sound good because there was no there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was no hey here's the minimum require </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into the sanitary room there was nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was just if you want to audition yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I saw the replies to this thread and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like all thirteen Ewald sounding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> girls auditioning yeah but that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because the main [ __ ] like readership </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh yeah smoking our thirteen-year-old </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> girls yeah though it shouldn't be from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> purely based on context it should not be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just worrying with these kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> things as well because normally like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I've done plus eighteen project I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally ask for proof of ID yeah and if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I cast someone like they need to show me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> their ID and this should definitely be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the situations where I like those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those precautions should be taken yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if it's fan-made right like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not a good look for you if you you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> getting thirteen old girls to voice in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your thing about like it's still very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> early days I mean it's from what it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sounds like it sounds like a situation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where someone just way too much press </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got way too much press way too quickly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because I have no doubt that they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably have no [ __ ] experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I saw on their Twitter actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just this morning yeah they tweeted out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> being like oh my god after someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> retweeted my thing I've gained like ten </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thousand Twitter followers in like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> overnight and like you know this person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously like came from Lee pretty much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> close to zero phone yes so for them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a lot yeah that's that's a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like pressure just immediately built up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on them yeah because you're going after </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> such like I don't wanna say iconic but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a very like very very dedicated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> series no I think it's not just that as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well because I think what really built </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> up the hype as well as we're in like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this environment now where webtoons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime it cumbia are being major so it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wouldn't be it wouldn't be it wouldn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have been so surprising to say killing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Stalkings getting an anime as opposed to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like last year even two years ago where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know we didn't have any presidents </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for that now with tower of god airing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and god of high school and knobblies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> all guessing animes it's like maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're in a new era where people are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> expecting that's their favorite webtoons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or their favorite web comics or whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> country is could get anime adaptations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean to be fired I wouldn't be against </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the idea of it actually getting an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> official adaptation the only stolen yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it could be definitely make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> waves I mean it would make sense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> considering that recently there's been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a big trend of like as I said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> earlier like over sexualized seriously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we've got a shoe mats in a harem yeah my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] god how they gonna handle how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> are they gonna handle that because there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is legitimately a sex scene everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like I'm not even kidding so III don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> know anything about this monographs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> earlier what is it called again it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> called shoe mutts on a hair or worlds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Harold in a harem and basically the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the overall plot I'm over simplifying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this but basically it's a hemorrhoid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> humanity has gone to [ __ ] where there is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a disease that is killing all males it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> affecting males so basically now you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell males now are becoming like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> commodity they're basically being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> treated like males that have like to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> survive this disease yeah basically like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> treated as like national let me guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right first of all the difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between this and hentai right is that if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a hentai it being ugly bastard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like the dynamic see this is where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> difference from a hint either is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> our main character has like this girl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that he's been thinking about his whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> life yeah and basically like doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to just go around and like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah sex everyone in order to save he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> met he'd rather keep his like purity for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the goal that he leaves been thingy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> crazy it's about it's about waiting for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the right person it's basically blue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> ball feed the monitor because everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> else all five other guys having a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] great time they're [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different chicks every [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they're pretty much they're pretty much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hinto protagonist should be I'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being sold on this but saying that I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't solving than two species </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reviewers until I watched it I thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this is pretty funny it's not gonna be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as good in two species reviews is like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> really weird case because it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something that was definitely deaf </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the Itchy in the manga in the manga in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the anime they just made it poor but I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still like I I still I know in species </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> reviewers to me is that line between </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hentai and itchy because you don't watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interspecies reviewers to jack off right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah but it's undeniable that there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is just a straight-up sexiness which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really interesting though because the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one sex scene that everyone was raving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on about in the anime I think was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> episode 4 3 3 episode 3 was never in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> manga no it wasn't it was implied all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sex scenes of that series isn't your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> slide in the manga but in the anime that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was just like [ __ ] it let's just show it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like put things in perspective you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't even see nipple in the manga wow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was that was like no you seen this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> man's Twitter he knows a nipple when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he's in all the volumes and I've enjoyed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> every single one can we talk can we talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about your Twitter and a bit clip is why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> can you please explain your Twitter and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay whenever I go on Twitter right I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't follow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hentai artists on Twitter because I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't need to because this man's got me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cuz as you know on Twitter when you when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you like when you like a picture there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> a good chance for some reason especially </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Joey's typically it comes on my Twitter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm a scan at least every time I </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> everybody's fine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> am I like am i only twitter preferred </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what I have no [ __ ] clue per it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it is I'd say 70 to 80% of the time I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see Lutz on my timeline it is you it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> true [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first of all you're welcome okay because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this used to be the case and yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> swear you were way more timid about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how did how did it cuz I'm scared of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing that cuz i I don't know cuz I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean I shouldn't really excite you get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> half naked so my videos but yeah I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know I was I was worried about like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> she's just having porn on my thing but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not I guess I could get away with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because how did you go from not sharing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> porn to basically just to being beat the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hentai I've always shared that's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> thing have you didn't I mean maybe not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as frequently no no I know you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> seeking I I think it's it was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Twitter changing the like button to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> basically the because for the entirety </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I've been on Twitter yeah I've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> liked hentai yeah because I followed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hint I like people like hentai other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> side like yeah I've discovered but I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> never retweeted it because of this exact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> reason I don't want other people's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> timelines but Twitter was just like hey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> let's just like make the like button </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a raider retweet button </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got us how much of your feet is just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> head that's why I asked to see his phone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> do you want to see you nail it wasn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that bad when I first saw it I mean the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> thing is I don't follow that mini Han </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Toyotas yeah I know that's hard to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> believe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I I genuinely don't the thing is I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> follow a hand Thai artists that love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> retweeting other hand time yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's where I find all the people okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scroll scroll through what you scroll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> down which we don't see let's see how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> many how many come up that one one in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> three can you also like everyone that it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was likes from one this is oh yeah go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Ike's go to my likes oh that's another </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one that's two in a row oh wait there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a Jimmy Neutron that that's not meant I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah that's basic okay let me while </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they're looking through this widow let </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me defend myself real quick okay the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason why I like it is because at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> end of the day these are just drawings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right there's a difference between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> liking like actual human pawn versus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just a picture this man's about to go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the hens eyes are true I am genuinely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one of those people who looks at hantai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> as odd no I totally agree with you I'm </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> continues I'm like you know what the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> guys [ __ ] the HTC casts are the wrong </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> me [ __ ] man happy with by - or me as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] maybe in future we can return to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this topic when I've you know done my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> research </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so we're getting ahead of ourselves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right now okay like this this was meant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to be an introductory episode when we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> introduce what we won't even don't like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these topics I'm sorry it won't always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> be hentai by the way because preface </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I just but I think that I mean the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> main reason we started this as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we always hang out together like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's not one of those things like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> some youtubers hang out they make videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> seems like their friendships great we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all actually hang out together all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] time and we always talk for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> two hours yeah what looking at and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> essentially what we do on a daily yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like we easily have conversations where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we just talk for like three hours about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> manga anime and we're like why don't we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just [ __ ] not even about manga or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime anyway and I remember the last </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time we were at your house and we talked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about like what was the best burger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> joint really legitimately late </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about like is in and out overrated or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> not for like it's not it's not by the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> way it is okay we're gonna get into but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I suppose uh I guess that's we're gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be talking about like anything and it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> evolved over the time yeah I mean the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> core of is anime and manga I mean I have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of things about anime manga that I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to talk about but I also want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talk about the culture the community </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hentai more henselae yes yeah and I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm also like just general because we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all were youtubers we'd want to talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about sometimes if there's YouTube drama </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we feel like we can probably add </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> something of course well you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes if there's just like standard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> banter of just laying on whatever the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] then yeah well if any of our </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Mutual's are ever in japan like if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> want to talk anime and manga with us hit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> us up yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and not even just our Mutual's like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just if you want to like come on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the show and my talk first of all you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna come on to the show physically sit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sit right here names because we wanna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ideally this will be a four-person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> podcast and hopefully we I mean I'd be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really interested in to bring youtubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on who don't really get to talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anime yeah I guess yeah I mean if there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> are any youtubers watching this video or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you know the tweet or whatever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Suzanne I guess let us know if you'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like to come onto the podcast because we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> will happily welcome because it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> surprising I've met so many youtubers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who have nothing to do with anime or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything to watch anime who watch anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and just really want to talk about anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> too so yeah I think I think it's pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> awesome because I remember anime was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> nowhere near this popular before oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I remember the feeling of being the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> only anime fan and haven't having there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing I don't want to talk about I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mean I think that's why I started my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> youtube channel yeah like that was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my reasoning is that I hadn't no want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> talk to this about let's just say like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kids today have it like you're an anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> fan like this a day in high school you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> have it so much easier than any of us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> did my god I wish I I'm so jealous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because I wish I could have just talked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to my [ __ ] friends about Naruto </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or one piece or Santa convinced my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> friends to get into anime God in order </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for them in order to find someone to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like another thing that I when I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talk to Americans they don't have this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> problem at least in my age group I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine yours as well right yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like we at Americans had it good but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> British people and I think probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> standing people are more closer to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> British like [ __ ] ruthless at school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like and I remember I got [ __ ] for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gaming too much at school so how the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] am I gonna [ __ ] for gaming too much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in school so how am I gonna sit there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like alright so Call of Duty that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> thing that you play but give me [ __ ] for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> how about you check out these anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> titties right I I built up years getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to like a medium level of like yeah in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> between a level of popularity yeah but I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> got out of the bullying zone if you will </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't want to go back to you look crazy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just how like I don't wanna say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mainstream mainstream yeah it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mainstream at all but like I guess just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how much more accepted it's become as a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sub it's good it's good yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely definitely is because I feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like anime works so well meme culture oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my god you know what I mean yeah an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> anime in a sense is meme culture in a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of ways I mean I'm flying a room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you mentioned meme culture and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime you all know what we're talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about yeah but I feel like because of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that it's a lot more people know what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime is or at least have seen a meme or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a screenshot or a gift </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah of probably Joe Joe will happen as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it should be it's the only animal that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> matters and then people would just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recognize that a lot more because I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember when I was growing up people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't even know what anime was yeah the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> words animated they're like what the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] is this year yeah that's some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cartoon porn [ __ ] you know what I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah absolutely it's weird because I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> think one of the biggest like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> double-edged swords to anime has been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Netflix like in the sense that like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got a lot of people into anime yeah but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then when you get really into anime it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> becomes like the [ __ ] worst place to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go oh definitely gonna talk about light </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and tore that more future but I also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> helped locks I mean they've been pushing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I remember like when they start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> getting anime like death </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would not get off my [ __ ] recommend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it on at Netflix really yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like full metal lockers Brotherhood I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> think they have that I think they have </SPEAKER_03>
