<SPEAKER_06> - At about like 2:00 A.M. one night, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like basically naked. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I open the door and there's
just two girls sitting there, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> opposite my door. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> SpongeBob has been on like
full volume in my room, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like, what are you-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you're naked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Welcome back to another
episode of Trash Taste podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm your host Joey and
with me are the boys, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the British boys, the BBs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I thought you only have like
a Neanderthal or something-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay.
- Come Joey anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's up residents of cuckfield. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Welcome to another
episode of Trash Taste-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, I'll take it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't expect that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you're actually from cuckfield, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then there you go there's your shout out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Today I found out that I was
on a Samsung ad by accident. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't know.
- Oh, yeah, I saw that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah, I saw it, you sent
the clip to Sydney, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, I didn't, no, I didn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I--
- I saw you re-tweeting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm pretty sure, oh, like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did I say something, I
don't think I said something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I, I-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was for your Fivver thing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - So I did a Fivver video </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where I became a Fivver
seller and normally, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Fivver you get like vastly under charge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's kinda how basically
this website works. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I got contacted
by someone who was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, let's do an actual ad." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought great this is
amazing content for the video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I can actually show
people like how to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - My skills. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right, I was like, "I'm flexible." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And I asked him a few questions </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause normally when you do a
commercial with voice acting, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you need to figure out
like the buyout fees. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And depending on basically
how much the ad is gonna play </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and how many countries it's gonna play in, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is like how do you calculate a buyout fee. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> So this is the normal studio fee, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like the doing the work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there's the fee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for essentially using
your voice worldwide. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, you know, it
varies a lot like you can, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I know dudes who've gotten
like 50K of one hour. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean, you were talking about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like in a previous podcast
episode about the guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> who does the ads for McDonald's. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, he lives off just that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, I did a commercial one time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where I got like $8,000
for just one hour of work. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was that the boats one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which one was that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It was a car one, I'll have to find it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can get the link. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, you said that you did like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a shaving one as well, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I've done shaving
one in the past as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or whatever the fuck it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, ages ago, ages ago.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And basically, you get paid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like quite a lot for doing these. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, okay, cool, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Nice, nice and I thought, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, this commercial seems
kind of small, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like this guy just-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - So how much did he pay you? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I asked 'cause I thought this
ad was like pathetic, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I asked for $300.
- Oh! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I was like it's only
gonna take like 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You were thinking of the content. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was what on your mind, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't wanna be too greedy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I really wanted to get it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I thought 300 is a
normal like studio rate fee. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Plus like whatever, it's
gonna play on the internet, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it's not a big deal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I actually
had to do like dubbing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like actual mouth dubbing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so you actually had
to dub out the entire scene. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yes, so I dubbed over the dudes mouth. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't actually see the ad, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just saw you like retweeting
it or tweeting about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's weird, I don't think my voice fits </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the dude that well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was so weird watching it
'cause I was watching the ad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I didn't know what the process was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but what it felt like was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember watching like
those old Hong Kong movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where it was like badly dubbed
lip flaps like over the film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like some cow shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly, that's what it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, it's not bad, I mean-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, he was still
saying what you were saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, it just I think
the problem is, is that like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> especially 'cause everyone knows my voice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The problem is that like,
everyone knows my voice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's not what you
hear when you hear my voice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Normally if, you know, you
don't really know the person, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, 90% people are gonna
hit the ad aren't gonna be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, "Oh, yeah, yeah,
that's normal ad, no biggie." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> But people know me are
like, "What the fuck! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Like what the fuck!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it was so weird we're
hearing your voice come out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> of like a really old man
or something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've done that before though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like that's really like nothing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it was like legit Samsung? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like a Samsung ad, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what it's for, but- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Then they got like
the deal of the century. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I was fucking ripped off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, I mean, I priced what
I thought was fair based on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the seller had told me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And if I knew it was gonna be Samsung </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's gonna be like
worldwide like that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean we all would've had (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You thought you were playing them, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but in the end they were playing you man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was getting played, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - They played you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I said, "Why the fuck is
Samsung hiring five voice actors? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What the fuck!" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you think that they'd
got to like professional-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's a little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not to say that, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> some voice actors aren't professional. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hearing more stories makes me wonder </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> how many big industry companies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are like going on these small sites, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, like hiring Fiverr voice actors, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> going like putting job ads
on Craigslist whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think what's happening-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right Raelynn? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - That hurts, what I do
you think happens is that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> okay, so Samsung is there
like, "Listen, guys, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we have a genius advertisement here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We want a company to handle it." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> They go and find and ad agency
and then that agency is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "We know just the guy." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They pretty hire another agency </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who then pretty hires the final agency </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that actually makes it and then
they've got like no budget. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So they're like get the
Fivver voice actors. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I'm not gonna lie a
lot of Fivver voice actors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are really fucking good and
getting charged like nothing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean, I would argue
that like almost everyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on that website is probably
a little too overqualified </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> for what you're paying for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's how that website works. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean they're either overly qualified </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or they're heavily under qualified. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's true.
- There's no in between. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - They'll be people like
a Blue Yeti that are like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> "Yeah, I guess I can give you
the commercial rights to it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and, you know, 50 more
words are gonna run, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ah, Jesus, 400 bucks man." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, "Bro what the fuck!" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've had that with like artists as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where some of them are
just like fucking goatee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's like you
should make an art book </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and then other people are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Just started a Deviant
Art two days ago let's go." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - $100 per commission, let's go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's such a coin flip because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even if they have like
a good portfolio, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've had experiences where
I've hired like artists </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to produce like an artwork
or music or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it is not up to the level
they put on their portfolio </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or their public portfolio.
- Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can tell he was
like, here's my A list work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're just getting
the D list work on Fiverr, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause you're not paying me
like $500 or some bullshit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Same with the voice acting as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause a lot of people get
their demos done in a studio </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like formally like mixed,
produced professionally </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and that kind--
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then when they do it at home, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're just like (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - They get their fucking Blue
Yeti set up in a hotel room </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's like, "All right." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They're just like this is shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know if this is
what I paid for, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> say that's how I got fucking scammed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, I mean, I got
paid, hey, I didn't get scammed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's my bad like--
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well played Samsung in advertisement. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did you record this commercial shoot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or was the commercial
recording in your own room? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, in my own room.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I did it like I, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I didn't do any of the trimming actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause they wanted to do it
so it was pretty painless. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The only thing was is that like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because the lip flaps
they had like fucking, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> of course they zoomed in
on this man's fucking face, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so the lip flaps was so pronounced </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so you can see exactly which syllable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in which letter he was on so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And there was one where they
sent me where they were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey, can you change the
script on this one line?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "No, the man's
lips say this thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What do you mean can I change the script? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't fucking change it to what you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've added in like three more words. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> How do you think I'm gonna do that?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you should have
done it just to really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like drive on to like home
the Kong power of it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like--
- I should have just sent </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to them been like this is what you wanted, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> this is what you asked for, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this just 300 bucks by
the way, this is what you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That would have been hilarious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like the lip
flaps clearly say like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I love Samsung." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But you just can't change
it to like, "Buy Apple." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - 'Cause it's like the next
level from anime dubbing, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause with anime dubbing-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so much harder than anime dubbing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, with anime dubbing
you have to match all like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the lip flaps of the syllables. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it's two frames, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's open mouth with close mouth, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, three frames actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I know this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> because I have to edit
lip flaps in a bridging </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause in a bridging it's easy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause you take you take your script </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you just fucking edit
these three frames of mouth. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's closed mouth, half
opened and fully opened. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - But with dubbing you obviously
can't edit the lip flaps </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything like that so you just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> sometimes you hear some lines </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's really, it's a really
unnatural line, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> but you just gotta match
what the animation is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it's really like makes you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as if you trying to do it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it really makes you fucking
appreciate these like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> in the countries where they
mainly dub a lot of the imagery </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they import like how
fucking insane that is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they managed to do
like full seasons of shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and like it's not terrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so hard because you're so constrained </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with other mouth shapes because, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, you have to exactly copy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And luckily this was English, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like, oh my god, another language. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Meanwhile you have countries like Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that it just like fuck that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I have noticed Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is just like fuck the lip
flaps, let's just talk over it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what makes it like a
million times more hilarious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, I know, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The change in the voices
is already hilarious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but then seeing them like
say something that just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> not a single mouth movement is correct. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You almost like don't mind it though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause you realize they're
just like they're not, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they're not trying to do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, yeah, whatever
man, I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm supposed to be sent
like fucking, some fucking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like History Channel Car
restoration show on TV. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And they had like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like a really like old British guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they had like the proper
like Samurai sounding old dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Wow, okay, geez." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's not what he, I mean,
that's what he sounds like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I don't know, I'm like, cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was kind inappropriate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's how the old dude
sound like a Japanese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like Munna, Munna, Munna, Munna. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I don't even know what to say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you say Munna Munna? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think he just did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Munna Munna Munna. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fuck it no, they don't
do that, total shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Speaking of Munna, did we
talk about that time we went </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to a Jojo bar last week or? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think we did so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, yeah, 'cause I wanted
to talk about the Jojo bar so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, to explain like two weeks ago, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we went to the same Jojo bar
that Joey made a video on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what it is about Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that has so many of like these small bars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that are like, themed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they're like way cooler
than any of like the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the big bars that
you go to in the West </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or that I've been to like in
England that tried to make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this themed bar, you what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it was so small
and it was so intimate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was run by a guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who clearly really fucking love Jojo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I think the thing what
impressed me the most was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the fucking drink list. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my god, it's gigantic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Holy fuck! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like the, because
in my video as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and when we got there they
say that you can film anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can take photos and videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> of like any of the merch
or anything like that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> but you can't take a picture
or video of the menu. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> For the longest time I
never understood why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Like why only the menu? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But then when you actually
flip through this menu </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you realize there's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> almost like 1000 fucking drinks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think there's like, there's gotta be, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm counting my head like maybe like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> around 300 drinks I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- I'd say so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's like more than
like your conventional </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like bar thing.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And out of those like three 400 drinks, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> half of them are originals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It just says original. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're all like named
after, you know, characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and phrases and whatnot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And you have to fucking like
perform the phrase as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the bartender. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's so like embarrassing
when like you say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like lines like, "Excuse me,
can I get the (indistinct)." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then she's like,
"Okay, one (indistinct)." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Coming right up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Coming right up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Here's your (indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because to explain
how the menu works, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically the menu works
like, like a fucking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the menu is the Jojo reference, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So it goes by parts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So every drink is either named
after a character or a stand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or just a random reference. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, you know, you have like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a random catchphrase or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Was there like a drink in
part four that was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> let's kill da ho or something like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Let's kill the hoe.
- Let's kill the hoe, bitch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was like a reference to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the dead dog in part one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and one of them was Wells
or was it something-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah, it was like
Danny or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was his name, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Something like that
and then that was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh my god, there was just
so many funny sounding ones </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like I just loved those
one Bohemian Rhapsody. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, that's a stand. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I just loved that I could
order a drink called </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a Bohemian Rhapsody. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I just found it
super cool that I was just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically ordering a fucking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, Kira Yoshikage
or something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, you just basically
ordering Jojo references </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and I thought that was fucking brilliant. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Although there was one thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I was like kind of upset about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I don't know if this
is gonna be a spoiler </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for part seven, but I was very upset </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I couldn't order a Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah, I would have
liked the Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was looking through part seven, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like please say
there's a drink I'll try. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Was there a President of
the United States as well? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think there was either. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, no, though I
think there was a, was there? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, there was Funny Valentine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was Funny Valentine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Was there another George Bush? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - George Bush. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, 'cause he's a
Canon character, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That he appears. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, I probably don't remember. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or it's like a character
that's mortal or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't fucking know but-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - See what I love about being a Jojo fan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> is you only watch the anime
hanging out with you two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We have like red way further in the manga, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> is that I was hanging out to this bar </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you were just like straight
up putting out spoilers </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> of part six and part seven. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the great thing about Jojo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is that I was listening to these
spoilers and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I don't think I've actually
been spoiled at all honestly." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is just the only
show that you can spoil </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> without actually giving anything away. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It makes so little sense
that when you hear it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like you just
don't see it ever coming </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're reading it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, so in part seven
Dio turns into a dinosaur </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because he's going off to Jesus Christ arm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're just like, "I
guess that's what happens." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, that was my
exact same like reaction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I knew that happened but I didn't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like when I was reading
it I was like, "Oh!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And I only realized it when
it was happening I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, that's what everyone meant." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause out of context it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how is this plot point supposed to fit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> into this story in any sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hearing it out of context it's just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it doesn't hinder your enjoyment </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when you're actually
experiencing the entire thing, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> which is why I'm fucking
looking forward to when, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm hoping when part six,
part seven has animated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Although hearing you guys
talk about it in the bar, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I might just like go out
and read it honestly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so good dude, it's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Part six to seven manga
is fairly incredible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm a Jojo like cock JoJo
or cock sucker whatever, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so it's like I mean, I've (indistinct). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was Jojo fan basis
comment, JoJo cock suckers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's basically what they are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What is it with all the memes
where it's like a Jojo fans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when they see it on the
site cock or whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> is what it is, is fucking memes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like the best part is though is it like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you don't know if the drink, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like this is just like original, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> So you have no idea what it
is, but you kinda gotta guess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is it gonna be like a
fruity easy to drink drink </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or is it gonna be like
just fucking alcohol </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like straight liquor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> unlike Joey just somehow kept ordering </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like just he was like, "I'll have the Ri </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and the Ora Ora Ora and
they were all just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically straight spirits. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I kept ordering stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that was all like Malibu's
fruity drinks, I was like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually think he has a kind of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a power leveling system
going on with the drinks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause anytime you'd ordered
like a main character </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or like a JoJo, it was always
a super powerful drink. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know like out of
all the powerful drinks I had, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the most powerful one I had was-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Stroheim. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it was part three Dio. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wasn't it really the Ri was
like really straight vodka? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ri as well was fucking
bad and I'm like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - You had to actually
order a drink by going, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Ri toxic on this house."- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then this cute
bartender girl was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, Ri that's toxic." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But here's the thing, do you
think he actually remembers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> every drink that he made 'cause
most of them are originals? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean he has to, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh wait, when you order
the Yoshikage Kira as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it comes with a separate hand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, it came with a separate hand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I thought was fucking brilliant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the Sex Pistols. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sex Pistols comes on like a
roulette like style table thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> with a gun in the middle
and that's actually cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's like just different shots. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just basically six shots. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is perfect about shoots shot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you go to the menu you one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> you don't know how strong
the drink is gonna be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and like two, you don't
know what the drink </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is gonna be either so it
was just a fun experience </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just working your way through the menu </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> and just being like, hey, this is a Kira </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or this is like Sex Pistols </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just being surprised
at what you got basically. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I think as well
that's such an awesome </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like marketing move as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> because that just incentivizes
you to go back to it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was being like, "All
right, I finished all </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> the part one drinks this time round, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> next week I'm gonna go back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and finish all the part
two drinks all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's basically like
watching Jojo itself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You walk through each part </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> until you get through every part. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can't skip any of the parts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to like complete it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I had like five Rohan Kishibe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like Rohan Kishibe at the store, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Rohan Kishibe at the Lourve. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, no, it was like Rohan
Kishibe goes to Gucci, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> That's was one of the drinks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I was like how many
Rohan Kishibes are there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> What the fuck! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know what, my favorite
one was when you ordered </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like a Jotaro and you have to like specify </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which parts are, which part
Jotaro are you ordering? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's was awesome, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like those kinds of establishments </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> are just the most perfect place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to just weeb the fuck out, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Because it's like if forgives
you for weebing out, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You get so drunk as
well 'cause you're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you just wanna keep fucking drinking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like reasonably priced, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like I don't know like $7 a drink. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and all the cocktails
are delicious as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, they taste really,
really good even though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, half of them fucked me up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> because they were so fucking strong. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just kept getting the straight shot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and I kept getting the nice ones </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, "Oh, yeah." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, "I want
something nice to just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like sooth my throat off
all these fucking shots </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I'm saying? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I kept ordering these fucking Sex Pistol </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and it just gets, it's
just straight up six shots, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not even a cocktail. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - But yeah go check it out
if you guys are at Nakano. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - What was it called again? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's called a- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dio, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It called Dio, yeah, in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So when the country opens
up, gonna pay them a visit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They have a Twitter as well, like Dio bar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, they have a Twitter. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, right now in Nakano Broadway, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which if you're gonna come to Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I reckon like a lot of weebs
come to Japan and they're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "We need to go to Akihabara,
we need to Akihabara." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I reckon like Nakano Broadway </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is also a very, very much
- It's fun and awesome, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's kind of like the
underground version of Akihabara. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a condensed Akihabara. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly 'cause
everything you can get. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Most of the things you get in Akihabara </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just condensed down into one building </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you can basically walk
around it for a lot less time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than you would Akihabara. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there's just, I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's just like in Nakano Broadway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel there's just a lot
more like interesting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like old Tokyo stores like
very, very niche stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like you might not
necessarily be into it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's just really
fucking interesting to see. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because the thing
about Akihabara is that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> once you've been once you
see what the former is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You see what shows get on display, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's all like the Moe stuff normally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and, you know, it's a lot
more difficult to find </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of the nicher shows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and kind of like figurines or merchandise </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that are like less mainstream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But in Nakano Broadway, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you find a lot of like untapped gems, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> unlike, there's really good store there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> There's this fucking
store in Nakano Broadway </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like right at the
entrance of Nakano Broadway </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that sell Gengars from the anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like they sell like Cels from anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right, oh, I saw that one, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm like what the fuck, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, like some of
these Cels are quite cheap </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they're probably like
mass produced the one that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is just based on shows
that no one really cares about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but some of the more expensive ones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are just like holy shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I remember there was a Cel from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The End of Evangelion that I saw from the, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's in the top floor of Nakano Broadway, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if I remember correctly,
and it's right at the back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> But they have some like
really classic Cels. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The most impressive one
I saw was one from like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The End of Evangelion, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it was the Asuka's flight as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And it was an expensive boy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How much was it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like, I think it was like $10,000. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that sounds about right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - For a piece of paper. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, at that point is
basically like a museum-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, no, that's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How can you put a price? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do they get that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what I wanna know, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How does that like get
in the hands of someone? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like maybe
they'd like sell those often </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like auctions or-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe some staff member takes it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then they sell it on-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, "It's only one
Cel they wouldn't know." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like, "Hey man, this
Crunch is brutal man, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna take a little something home, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> make a little bit of cash
on the side, you know?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a snitch in the studio, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we'll take it out ourselves. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think they're only just
gonna get more expensive because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now animation studios don't
use Cel animation anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So at this point it just becomes like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a memorabilia, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Of our history because you can't, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, you can get like Gengars
and everything like that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> but having a good old fashioned
Cel is just not a flex. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because you can't
like, unlike a Gengar, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> you can't like, you know,
photocopy a Cel, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Because it's based off
like a plastic sheet. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's much easier to tell
when a cell is completely fake </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I've seen some
fucking completely fake Cels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just like all these
like flimsy pieces of paper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and people paying stupid
amounts of money for it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they don't know any better, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, "No,
don't, what are you doing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just a fucking drawing." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you guys miss the old
like Cel animation aesthetic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> compared to like much cleaner
digital aesthetic of today? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's been bittersweet
for me I think like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously like, you know,
the digital stuff now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is like so much better
choreographed unlike the later ends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you can tell that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like all these camera movements were done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through a computer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But I don't know there's
something really charming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> about like, you know, a
manual like camera shake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> in terms of making a Cel. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ed, Edd n Eddy great animation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Old Cels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude man I love that,
I love the bubbly lines, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, I mean, it's great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's comfy, it's comfy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, like Redline was all- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was great, that was- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's fucking, oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And that took like what 10 years? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Seven years.
- Seven years, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It took a little while,
it took a little while. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But yet no one fucking watched it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, I will say
that I think, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on average animation is better quality now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> because digital animation has made things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has made it easier to get
a higher level quality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of animation for like most animes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, I think you're right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there is like a definite charm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> about watching good old
fashioned Cel animation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I definitely
wouldn't want all my anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to be based off Cels, but--
- No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There were some like,
especially like when you go back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> to like, you know, the whole like '80s </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just like general anime
aesthetic, that like the, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh yeah, this is an '80s
anime goal aesthetic." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like that on Cel animation is just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like a bowl of like Rice Krispies. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I never eat a fucking
bowl of Rice Krispies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when I do I'm like,
all right, okay, yeah-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not bad.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But then the next day, you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "I don't even think about Rice Krispies." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> That's how I see it, do
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't but I'll just nod. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't give a fuck about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll just nod and agree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I know literally zero things about cereal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't eat cereal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, me neither. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's why it's like, it just
kind of reminds you being </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a kid again, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't fully agree with you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll just use analogies all right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll just assume that like your fucking-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what old Cel
animation reminds me of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> a bowl of cereal, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't eat cereal 'cause--
- [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Frankly, I don't care for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There I said it, okay? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Controversial pitch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it's not controversial. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] It's not controversial. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Here's a controversial
thing when I do eat cereal, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't eat it without milk,
I'd eat it without milk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what I'm saying, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want my cereal dry, I
think the milk ruins it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's better than folk
people who say like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking monsters who say like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh yeah, I use water in mine." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, that is a level
even I was duped too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm pretty sure that's like how you end </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like Jiva convention that
have to do that, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And that's like fucked up like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's basic human rights. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I do, I knew a guy in-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's bullshit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - I knew a guy my uni, no,
I saw him fucking do it too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I knew a guy my uni who-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you call the police? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dead ass, yeah, I was about to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I'm being assaulted right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My eyes are being assaulted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> No, it was fucking disgusting you-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I never condole like
spitting in someone's food, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but I think that's an
exception to be made. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, he was eating like just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like basic
ass cornflakes as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like it's already
a human rights crime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to just eat cornflakes with nothing in it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> let alone with water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually I could eat
cornflakes with nothing in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it depends on the cornflakes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but like eating
with water is like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's a, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like here let me top
my water with more water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Who likes cereal when
it's the soggiest, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause that's all you're doing, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just making your cereal soggy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like were you that
desperate for hydration </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you needed to go for
your fucking cornflakes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like what the fuck! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's why whenever
I used to eat cereal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in high school, I would eat
that shit so fucking fast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did he make it through high school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> or did he like just not make it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, he was in my
uni so I guess he did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, shit, okay, wow.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The university took him in? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, "Man, like you
can't even afford milk at uni?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like are you that much of a-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I smell broke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you that much of a broke uni student </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that he can't even afford milk? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just go to the tap and you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "Here we go again another day." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know what it is about uni </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like communal kitchens </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and the one thing that always gets taken </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in the communal kitchens is the milk. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's always the milk. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know why, everything else-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is just because you can just take it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you think they
won't notice that's why, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but everyone does it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like you can label your cutlery, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can label your food to be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't touch this, don't touch this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> You can label your milk
but it never works. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Your milk will inevitably
disappear like a day or two, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they'll touch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because it's like
a lost currency, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like water but with calories. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I remember when I-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's water with attitude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's water with attitude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had a friend who was
in my dorm and I liked him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then one time, yeah, I
did like him but now I don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You did.
- I liked him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Emphasize the did. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, he was really
high and then I came in-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like stoned. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, stoned, he was really stoned. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I walk in and I see
him eating cookies and cream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Ben & Jerry's, and I'm
like, "Where's my, is that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's not, I could use some
cream and Jerry's is it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> And he's like, "Oh, sorry.
I'll buy you one tomorrow." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, I was
gonna eat that tonight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've planned a great
evening watching anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was gonna eat that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want your shitty
Tesco's one pound, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> four kilograms of vanilla
that looks brighter </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than like yellow on the
like hexadecimal thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't want that ice cream
that tastes like shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Why would you, that pissed me off so much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like vanilla ice cream
that's like way too yellow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> for its own good scares me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah, that aint- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like a fear I have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I have a fear of heights </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and way too yellow vanilla ice cream. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - It doesn't even tastes like ice cream, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it tastes like something, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what it is like that's-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like I don't wanna eat something-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's even worse than that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you get the soft serve </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and the soft serve isn't
white and it's yellow, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have you ever had that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- [Joey] I know I have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause at that point-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, where did you get that from? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, it's not like the,
it's it's always just in like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the fucking ice cream vans that
only come out in the summer. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I thought you were
talking about in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Not in Japan. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, okay I got it, I was gonna say-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - We get the top tier sheer here in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - They wouldn't morph it here in Japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's a British move. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This episode is sponsored by Postmates. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If you're like me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you start thinking about
what to eat for dinner </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> while you're eating lunch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I love food, but sometimes
getting into my kitchen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and cooking something delicious to eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just doesn't make it on my to do list </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why I definitely use Postmates. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But Connor we live in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joe, Joe, Joe, shh, they're paying this. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> which I've been using </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to order off my local restaurants here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so important that we support </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and uplift our communities right now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and what better way than
ordering some fine food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] And Postmates isn't just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all about burgers and sushi, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can order anything from
toilet paper to phone chargers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from stores like Walgreens and 711 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and Postmates will drop it off
right outside my front door. </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> - Thank you for sponsoring
this episode back to the video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - In England, sometimes they have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these ice cream vans, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> That only come out that
one day that it's summer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or that it's sunny and-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've never seen them do that though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Have you, have you never,
have you ever had the soft serve </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> from one of those ice cream vans before? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, you see it from coming out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of like the machine right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> The flake, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's 99 flake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And some of them they do come out white, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some of them they come out yellow, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And you always know it's
like the shittiest ice cream </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's not even ice cream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, ice, there's the ice and
the cream and the soft serve. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> With this, it's like 70%
cream and like 30% ice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's like, it's not even filling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But was it you who said </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that you're not a fan of soft serves? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think soft serves
tastes too milky, it's like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - But that's the best bit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nah, dude-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is the fact that it's milky. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It feels like I'm eating
milk, I don't wanna eat milk, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna eat ice cream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, yeah, soft serve
is the best ice cream. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Gelato, gelato is the best--
- Get the fuck outta here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Gelato is like eating a three course meal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> while eat like in one soft serve. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I like how gelato can
like crush everything else </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in my stomach down to make room. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, wait so you've never
had like a creamy a premium? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I have, I have. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you like it?
- I think it's too milky. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You like it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it's good
because it's a soft serve, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but I do agree that it's a bit too milky. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think, I think-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Japan are obsessed with
milk, I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think humanity peaked in soft serves </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and in ice cream in
general with the McFlurry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what it is about McFlurry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but I can eat that shit like for eternity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is the McFlurry a self serve? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, technically-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like it's in
its own category of ice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it's not even-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, out of us three, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're the only one who
ever worked in McDonald's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's like unfortunately it's you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it comes out of a machine, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That kind of looks like a soft serve. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Am I correct? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it soft serve? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's the same ice cream
that they put in the cone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> for like McDonald's ice cream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like the 20 cents ice cream. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know what it is
about putting a soft serve </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in a cup and then putting
some toppings on it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then fucking spinning it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I called it spinning, what, mixing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why that's
just the magical formula, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I remember the first
time I've tasted a McFlurry, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I like all these
ingredients individually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but put them together </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and mix them in a separate way and you-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You McFlurrried in your pants. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I McFlurried in my pants </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't even remember this,
but is the milkshake machine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and the ice cream machine the same? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do they--
- No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it not?
- It's not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's the same machine, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like two different settings though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I've had like three
McFlurries in my life so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, because the McFlurry the ice cream, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the ice cream machine in
McDonald's actually works, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the milkshake it's like 70%
of the time, it's not working. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause I remember when
I worked at McDonald's, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd like refill the milkshake machine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was like, it's just like a sack. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's just a sack of fluid, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And to fill this up, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have to like hold up
this bag and loosen the cap </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like pour it in the bag. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you ever tried to
pull a string out of a bag? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- It's like the fucking worst. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like there's no like faucet or anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not faucet, fucking like lid
or anything to direct it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just a fucking hole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so I'm pouring this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and then a little bit obviously
like started splashing off, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and so it started splashing
me like fucking whatever </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I put it all over my fucking
self in front of everyone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and the machine was broken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then everybody came around and-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - The machine was broken for another hour </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause we had to clean everything up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I fucking spilled everywhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - What was inside the bag? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like milkshake mix. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like mix. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So why is the milkshake
machine always breaking? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They have to clean it constantly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like that's when I was there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, they would fucking clean
it every few hours 'cause </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> apparently, obviously the milk
can get stale really fast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so they clean it.
- In an hour though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, but it's like they
have to clean it I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like two times a day at least, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't remember 'cause like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I wouldn't be surprised </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if the milkshake machine
was basically the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as the ice cream machine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's because a McDonald's milkshake </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is basically a fucking soft serve-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I agree, yeah , yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you have to drink
it through a straw. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's a melted soft soft serve. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So like every time I get
a McDonald's milkshake, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you have this like five
minute grace periods </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's impossible to
drink the fucking milkshake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, true, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause you eat- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's great 'cause you eat the food </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then you can drink the milkshake. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, 'cause you try sucking in it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and the straw just fucking collapses in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like wait, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like the McDonald's milkshake-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You create a mini
black hole inside of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like everything gets crushed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like my brother worked for McDonald's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and when I turned 16 I really
wanted the fucking Xbox One, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> so I was like, "I'm gonna
get a job at McDonald's." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> You're paid like £4.10
an hour, which is like $5 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> that was like maybe $5.50. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, yeah, I fucking hated it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember my brother
telling me he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> "Yeah, you can get sick of
McDonald's food really fast." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was like six months in I'm like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I fucking love this food stuff still like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd get to make your own
like, you weren't supposed to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> but like the managers were
like, "You could have this." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like you can basically
make your own burger. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> So I used to just make like the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in the UK we have like
fried chicken sandwiches, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they're like fancy ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> They used like the, like
they're like the better meat. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, it still little fucking awful, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I would just fucking put
like a handful of fucking bacon </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and just shove it on and
that was like the best part. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then you could get like
meals like half priced, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but everything else is
fucking awful at McDonald's. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Everything was awful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, the people were the worst part man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They were just like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - More like the workers or the customers? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Workers, the workers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, really, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I just didn't
get along with any of them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they will all, you
know, like not to be mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but a lot of the ones that I
worked with were like people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that like, I wouldn't be friends with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whenever I go to a McDonald's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> and I see like an employee
smiling, I'm like, "He's Cersei." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm like who is he murder today? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> So some are just like
orange Cersei right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember, I legitimately
got like, I got like put, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> had to come sit in the, like
fucking put on like detention </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for like 20 minutes 'cause-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - At the McDonald's? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - 'Cause I was working on the fucking, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like making the chicken
burgers and the burgers, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was making the burgers </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and they took me off for not smiling. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I said, I said, I said, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> "Why do I have to smile
when making burgers?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they looked at me like,
"Why did you ask that question?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they told me to go and
take a break for 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like George Orwell, wasn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like what do you mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dystopia, everyone has to smile. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What do you mean I'm
not fucking smiling mate, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm making a fucking
burger, what do you mean?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I couldn't believe it, I was furious. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's like they're at home, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they make their own
sandwiches they're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Shit, I forgot to smile." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I couldn't believe it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so I was like 16 one time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the one time when I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I fucking hate it here, was
when they were talking to me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and these dudes were like 25
and they were bragging to me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like both of them were
bragging to me about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how they were going to a
party in the school next to me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of like 16 year olds. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was like, "So you went to a party </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> full of 16 year olds?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And they were like, "Yeah, it was sick." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "Why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why did you go to a party full
of 16 year old, you're 25?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, shit, I wanted to
get with the girls." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "What?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yikes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - In the UK it's legal, 16,
but I was still like what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What the fuck! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but still. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - And the only nice people
there were the ones above 40, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> but at everyone near my age
was just the fucking worst. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And every time I had to
go and train someone, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so I was there for like three
months and after three months, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're ready to train people, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you're a fucking McDonald's
veteran because you've lasted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more than 90% of the fucking
employees no joke because-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I believe that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I believe that but it hilarious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because they hire so
much, they over hire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they know that
people are gonna like leave. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so I was teaching this one guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and he was clearly like,
just like not getting it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know, didn't wanna get it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I could tell he was
like, "Yeah, I'm not gonna, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm not gonna listen to this." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So about two hours into his
shift of me teaching him, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he goes, "I'm gonna get a smoke break." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He never came back, he just left. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> He just straight up left. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, he never came back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I had to do the
whole shift on my own, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then doing all this shit and
I was like, I went to my boss </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, "So, yeah,
he didn't come back." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He just went for a smoke break and-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - He just went for a smoke
break about two hours ago. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude he just pulled like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the dad leaving for a smoke thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's what I was thinking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - He went to buy cigarettes
he never came back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - He never came back and I was
like, "So what should I do?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, "Oh, you're
just gonna work on your own." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Like what do you mean?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And this another time I was making, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it was the same guy actually, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was the first hour of teaching him </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and when you're-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So what was the entire timeline? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How long did he work here
that you had to teach him for? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Three hours and a half
and he went for smoke break. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I had to keep working
because, and then I asked, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and this is really pretty bad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I honestly, I could have fucking
sued McDonald's for this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so when we were, this
really fucking hot oil, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like 400 degrees of ridiculous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fry oil?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's ridiculously hot and
this asshole next to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Yeah, just
gently put it in, you know?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Next to me while showing him I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "So put the chicken nuggets in here." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he fucking slams them in, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The oil went all over my hand, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yikes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then I asked could I go
and put it on the cold water </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to my boss and they were like,
"No, you gotta keep working." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, "What?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> So I'm here fucking like crying in pain, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> making these fucking burgers, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And then-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And don't forget to smile. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, don't forget to smile. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, "Don't forget to smile." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have a third degree burn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - And so, about an hour later, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> it's finally my time
to get a break, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm eating my burger
and you can see my hand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> is bright pink and like blistered. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And the other manager because of course, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's multiple managers
in just one McDonald's. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The other manager comes
in and is mortified. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He's like, "What the fuck is that?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He's like, "What happened?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm like, "Oh, I spilled oil on it." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And he's like, "Why didn't you
put your hand in the water?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, "Oh, because the
other manager said I couldn't." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And bear in mind I was
like 16, so yeah, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I should have known that
I could have been like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "No, fuck you, I'm putting
my hand in the water." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Again, when you're 16, if
the boss tells you to do- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You do what you're told to do, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You do what you do, right, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then he was mortified </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and the other boss got in so much shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they apologized to me profusely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And then they like were
like, "Yeah, it's okay, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you don't have to come to
work tomorrow, it's all paid." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was like, "Wow,
that's so nice of them." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> But I realized at the time they were just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like hoping I wouldn't
fucking try and sue them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I could have like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You could have easily. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I should have honestly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, it's some serious H&S problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, and then finally when I quit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I quit prematurely
because I was just done. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> My manager was a total bitch, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the store owner was
horrible, she hated dudes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like she would always
be so nice to the women </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that are working there and, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and whenever a guy did anything wrong, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> she would absolutely like shit on you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know I'm talking so much sorry, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is the last story I promise. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just can't get rid off
the fact that dude left off-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, he fucking left. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - My mind was speed running McDonald's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It took me like eight months to realize, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what he realized in two hours, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like that's what I would be glad-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That seemed disrespectful
at that point, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just like all
right, this isn't for me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'ma head out, I'm out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - He just walked out of McDonald's place. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - He was like, you know
what, the reduced money </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> on the meals is just
isn't worth it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause okay, you gotta admit, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was the fucking king
when in school I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You on a lunch break? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I get half price off McDonald's
meals who wants to come?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I remember the cool
kids in school worked, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> whoever worked at the coolest place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and could get like the best
discount, the discount, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so whoever works in the
fucking gaming store, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> they were the king. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, so I could be my
mate and in lunch I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "We can get a whole McDonald's
meal for two pounds, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wholemeal, any size you
want, treat yourself." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It was great, yeah, I
could have gotten fat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So anyway, I'm working
like a shift, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I'd actually been
training to be a lifeguard, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I did all the stuff and I
applied to be a lifeguard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and, you know, when you work some place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you put on a reference. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I never, have you ever had this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where they actually contact the reference? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never had that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> So I just thought it was like a myth. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought it was a bluff is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Go on name someone, name someone." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fucking day to call me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Name someone who we will
interrogate, I dare you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> So they actually fucking
called my McDonald's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> whilst I was working my shift. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So they do it and they come in like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "So Connor are you looking
for other employment?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm like, "Why, what do you mean?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> "Because we just got a
call from their council </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> asking for reference you to be a lifeguard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what's up with that, you didn't tell us." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, in my head I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Why do I have to tell you?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like fuck you, you pay me $4 an hour, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like what do I owe you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, what are they gonna be, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you can check out
but you can never leave. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, and I was like, "Oh, well, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I was looking for a better job." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And they fucking like flipped a switch </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when I said a better job. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They were like, "What do
you mean a better job? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> You think McDonald's is a bad job?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Well, mean-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm looking around and I'm like, "Look." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - What surprised me is like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> how little self awareness they seem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to have over there, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause the thing is Garnt, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't wanna shit on some of these guys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I know that I've met some managers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at McDonald's who are
genuinely like super nice guy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they have such like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they understand like it's a McDonald's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But the managers at my
McDonald's they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What are you trying to say mate? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You trying to say my
managerial job is like a joke?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And in my head I'm kind of
like, "Yeah, yeah, kinda." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you see the food safety thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we had to fill out a line
that was a joke come on." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, "Don't shit on the lettuce." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Obviously don't shit on the lettuce. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So the manager is really
pissed off, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The store owner is coming
in 10 minutes and he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "I want you to talk to the
store and explain yourself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> when he comes in." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, are you serious, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm 16, so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - They really didn't not
wanna make you leave at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They really like fucking put
me through the wringer dude </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for $4 an hour dude like
can you believe that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So my mom wondered why I
fucking hated working here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and she was like, "No, you're just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> over exaggerating Connor?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "No, it was awful." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So the manager, the store
owner comes in, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they made me go and talk
to her in front of customers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And she's rinsing me in
front of these customers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like shouting at me in
front of these customers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I thought that was like weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I was like about
to cry and I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "You know what, I quit." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I quit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - He said it, he said it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm going for a smoke break. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna take my smoke break. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - My mom was so pissed off at me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> She was like you have like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I'd actually been
accepted for the other job. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I had to be home like
a month and a half left </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> before I start the
other job, she was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I can't believe you
quit a month and a half </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before your next job Connor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's really like, what the fuck!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "Mom, you don't understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how awful this was." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's McDonald's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and like she
was just chewing me out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in front of these customers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not being paid enough to be humiliated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in front of these random people, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I don't, come on man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I'm so fucking young. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you smile the entire time? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yo, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just sitting down
like, "Okay, okay." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Show a smile as you're
getting rinsed still, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and as she was
just doing it, I go, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, you know
what, fuck it, I quit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I quit, I'm done, I'm
done, I'm not doing this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll finish this shift
but I'm done after this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not doing this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I never heard from them again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then yeah, I went there
like three years later </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> after I'd like been killing it on YouTube </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then the manager, the one
who was a dick head was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "What are you doing now Connor?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Well, I'm kinda-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, what did you want to know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you know, I just got back from LA, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, I went to visit
my friends in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, I was just making, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I work when I want make my own hours, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, it's great, you know?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You should have just been like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, I eat at Burger
King pretty regularly." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just feel my tax rates is intense. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Damn, did you know that
tax rates is so high </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when earn so much money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Dude damn, that shit damn hurts man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Anyway I'm kinda moving forward. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, some of them were nice, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but, yeah, everyone was an asshole. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, like
working in retail is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this isn't dissing anyone
who works in retail-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it is hard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - As someone who has
worked in retail before, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, a lot of people in college </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> or in high school they get
the first job normally works </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in retail and it's normally just to fuel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whatever hobby they have or, you know-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just look out for yourself man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's like this thing that I wish I did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, I wish I like just didn't roll over </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> because I was very obedient as a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I didn't really like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was always just taught
like whatever the elders </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or you know, the person
in charge says just do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They know best, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what the fuck
I was doing at McDonald's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what the fuck was I doing there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had no idea what I
was doing half the time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just did shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I, dude, oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I used to spend like, when they were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Go and get some fries
out of the freezer." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I used to spend like 10
minutes just sitting in there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I was like, "Fuck,
dude, what am I doing, man?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's so hot in the kitchen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> that when you get to the
freezer they're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Who's near the fries?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Me, me, me." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You just had a fucking
existential crisis </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just getting fries. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The McDonald's freezers
has become like a panic room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would literally just go
there for like five, 10 minutes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> as long as I can get away
with it and just sit there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and be like, "Fuck, fuck!" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Imagine if you open up a freezer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's like three
other employees in there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like everyone is just
trying to get to the freezer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was so jealous there was this one dude </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in this whole job was
just moving the crates </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> into the like freezer and
that was his whole job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, "I want that guy's job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck being in front of a deep fryer man." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> That made my acne so bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, fuck yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember when I
was working at a Co-Op, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> there would be all these
odd jobs I wish I could get. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like there would be one guy's job was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to fucking go outside and
collect all the trolleys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that people have taken to their cars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God, I want that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's so nice because you just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't have to interact
with anybody, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- That's the best job. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I was always on the table, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And my least favorite part of the job was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when anyone would like
try to make small talk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, "Look, I'm just
here to fucking stand here </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and take your money, why are
you trying to talk to me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't give a shit
about how your day is." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just talk to, beep, beep, nope. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got that smile talk as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause like when they talk
to you, you gotta smile </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you gotta be having a good day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> no matter what's going on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And I just be like, I don't know, I would, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't have like any bad
experiences with the customers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I mean, yeah, I had some
like fucking awful managers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's up with those cashiers, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Where they would like take
fucking joy out of idying you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> What's up with that, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if you just give your ID-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm violating my power. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like literally
like I'm being pulled over </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> by the cops and the ID
you for like a beer. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like, "ID please." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> (police sirens wailing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause that moment in time,
they have all the power. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, they look at the ID
like, "Hmm, nice address. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's a nice area to live in." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I hate that, like every time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> like 'cause in Australia, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Like whenever you go to a bar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or when you're going to the liquor store, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have to ID like everybody </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> even if you clearly look like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You have to at least reached
age 25 I think is legal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember like, I went
to a bar with my dad once </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and my dad got IDed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember he was
like, obviously the IDed me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was like 22
or whatever obviously, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then guy looked at my dad
and was like, "ID please." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> My dad straight up said,
"Are you fucking kidding me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you know how many gray
hairs I have on my face. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Of course, I'm not fucking 20 years old." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think he was like,
"All right, fair enough." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate that though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it's the movement of
looking down at your ID </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then just looking at you
with their eyes like this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's that movement, I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "What, is this fucking L.A Noire? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would hate the process </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whenever I was working Co-Op
and I had to ask for ID </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I was 16 at the time as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> For me, it just felt wrong
asking someone for ID </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was obviously
like younger than them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So anytime I'd have to
ask for ID there'd be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most nervous stutter
like it would be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it would be like as if
like the power dynamic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like the other way around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'd be like, "Okay, can, can, can, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> can I have, have, have your ID please?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And honestly, like, if
they gave him their ID, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, "Okay,
they probably over age." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You didn't even check it, yeah? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't have the
balls to ask my manager </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to come check this man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you check this guy's ID please? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - If they've gone through the
trouble of getting the fake ID </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just give it them the
fucking beer, why not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, no, it was like, remember
your 18th birthday though? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The first time you go to buy
like a fucking bottle of beer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I admittedly, I don't
remember my 18th birthday </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> for numerous reasons. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't remember what I did,
but I do remember being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah, being able to finally buy a bottle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember that first
point or that first beer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> as an adult and I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like the biggest
fucking empowering power trip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I've liked, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that I had felt in my 18
years of living until then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was living life on the
edge before that, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hey there boys and
girls, it's me, Mr. Titi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Or whatever the hell like
hold myself last time. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> Back to the video, wee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So anyway, let's move
on to the actual topic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of this episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was a very long tangent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 50 minutes tale
only on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've seen the sub-Reddit,
people are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Just make a whole episode of tangents." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> So, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's kind of what
just happened, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> We went from anime Cels to
McFlurries to McDonald's. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - One can argue like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "What is even the tangent anymore, right?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was going through my bag, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do you have stuff like
fucking papers in your bag </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that just crushed down that you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What the fuck is in this shit?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then you finally like claw
it out and you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "God, that's disgusting." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I pulled one out and it
was like an Anime Expo pamphlet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> from when I went to Anime Expo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (growling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I miss Anime Expo so much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I missed anime conventions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - So much man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I miss large crowds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I miss getting sick from all
the people fucking coughing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and sneezing on me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I never thought I'd miss Kahn flu. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just wanna be sneezed on
and don't worry about dying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I just wanna handshake with like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the sweatiest weebs at the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna hug that's a little
too damn for my life in there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just like, you
know, I miss it all man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wanna to put my hand on a shoulder </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and the shoulder is really
wet for some reason. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I miss going into the gaming room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and just feeling like the
dampness of the atmosphere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like the fucking, I don't know what it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about the gaming room and-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause everyone is
sweating in there that's why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's all the men from all
the players accumulating. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's all the game of you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like the fucking room
needs its own weather report, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a humidity report. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's mushroom, cloudy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's always mushrooms growing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in that room by the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - 92% humidity. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but let's talk
about the actual topic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of this episode, which is
funny or weird conventional. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just conventions period. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just conventions, just conventions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because like I've been
seriously craving conventions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, I never thought
I would miss conventions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I need it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like I think I hit
a new low the other day guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause being stuck in
the country, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm very used to, you know, flying out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and going to conventions and stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so like Casey Neistat video
started getting recommended </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to me of like him sitting
in like First Class seats-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I've watched them all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and then I watched one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I watched the entire
series because I just missed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the feeling of being in an airplane, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so I'm just like, "God, I
wish that was me right now." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think Garnt is like
in his chair reclining. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, gosh, it so uncomfortable, I miss it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I miss it so much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - And every time Sydney
comes in you be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, beef please." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Just creating your own turbulence. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like this is fun. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so--
- I remember, I think it was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't remember whether
it was last episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or the episode before, but
you were talking about like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is the longest period
I've ever been like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that I've spent not being on a plane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so many comments on the
sub-Reddit are being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Wow, that was the most
privileged Connor has ever said." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's true, I did dig that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's true like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because, you know, even, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't come from a very
privileged background, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but it's just part of coming from </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> an international background,
I would say because, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, you know, I'm full of
like, my full blood is Tai, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I was raised in England. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> So any chance we could get
to fly back home to Thailand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> we did and that was just part of my life. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know, every year I'd
go back and visit grandma </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and visit my family there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course, Sydney is
from America, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sydney is from America as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - America as well, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Good privilege reflect Garnt. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not privileged, I'm blessed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, but like, I don't know, like, just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it made me miss, like this year, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is the lack of conventions
because I thought at least </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that like maybe there might be
like some smaller conventions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we could go to hear. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because in the back of my head </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like just the other day, I was like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it same though in Japan? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I miss the kind of
scummy atmosphere in America-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, no, no, of course, but I
mean, like, yeah, I get that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But I mean, I've been to a
few conventions in Japan, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's still pretty
fucking fun because like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just the other day in the
back of my head I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> "Well, I'm probably stuck
in Japan until what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> At least the end of April I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the Japanese government said. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So in my head I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, that means I can go to
winter Comic Con finally." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But then I was like, "Wait,
can I just like go away?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Fuck!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> The one time I can go to winter Comic Con </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and winter Comic Con it's not happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That fucking sucks, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What about all the stories
I heard about Comic Con </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is just basically it's you go
in and you buy the merchandise </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> or buy the Doujinshi or whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you leave, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I heard, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's not like
the convention experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that we have in America. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Think of Anime Expo or any convention, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the entire convention
is the artist alley </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what Comic Con is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just a stupid amount
of just tables and desks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> where Doujin artists are
selling their Doujins </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or other similar art.
- Honestly though, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> honestly, I remember when, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you first go to conventions, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember like the first
conventions you go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I tried to go to every panel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have a fucking full on
schedule where I'm gonna be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, this is the time
going to the panel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the time I'm gonna
hit like the artists alley, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> this is gonna be the
time where hit up like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the convention floor and everything." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And now you go to enough conventions </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you're just like whatever man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then your occupation is just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Let's go to Chick-fil-A." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've never been to a
panel that isn't my friends </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> or my own. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah , me neither. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never liked just
seen a panel and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "That looks fun, I'll go." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I just don't like I'd rather eat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Eating is great, but-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I probably go hang out with people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now my favorite place to
go in the actual convention </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is probably the artist alley
because the artist alley, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I first started going was the place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I never hit up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then now you go to enough conventions, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you live in Japan as
well, and you go to like the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the main hall and most
of the stuff you can find </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the main hallways is like synonymous </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> across all conventions, but
I feel like artists alley </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is where you find all
the actual cool shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like the only,
usually with conventions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the only thing about a
convention a lot of the times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that's completely different
to any other convention </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is the artist alley
because you'll always find </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> some fucking artists or
whatever where you say, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh shit, I've never seen that before." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you go down like
to the regular thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and as you said, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, I could just fucking buy this Oikawa </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> for like a third of the price, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it's just like what's the point? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And the thing is especially
being with Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I've realized how limited my wardrobe is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like cycling through
all the T-shirts I have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because most of the time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every time I go to an anime convention, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I buy like two or three
T-shirts from the artists alley. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So just just because I haven't gone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to any convention this year, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I haven't been able to
recycle any of my new clothes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I saw a comment that
was like, "Oh my God, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Connor is wearing the
same shirt that he wore </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in episode like two." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like Episode 19 I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "How many fucking shirts do you own? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Do you expect me to throw
them away when I'm done? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I still haven't worn the same shirt yet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because now that it's getting cold, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can finally bust out my long sleeves. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I'm like, "Thank God I was about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> to run out of my short sleeved T-shirts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wore one shirt like a lot recently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and I got a fucking comment that was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Why are you always wearing that shirt?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, "You never heard
of a fucking laundry machine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or washing machine, like what
the fuck, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like why am I always
wearing the same shirt?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like what do you wear a shirt once </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> then you throw it away? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like you don't wash
your shirts, I'm confused, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> why is this weird, I don't understand. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but I mean, like
that's all they see, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - True, true, true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - A week span on Trash Taste might as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> just be a day to them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's made me self conscious about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just how many clothes
I have in my wardrobe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and how many shirts I can get away with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> without recycling the
same thing too many times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that people can notice, but-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, especially with you
because you very rarely, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like actually make a physical appearance </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in your videos, right?
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you don't have to care about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Normally, I don't care about this shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Normally, I'm just a
fucking disembodied voice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, who knows,
Garnt might be butt naked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when he's filming the
audio form you never know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd like to hope so anyway,
anyway back to convention. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yes, this ends with by the way. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Back to conventions. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> All right. I mean, fuck, what should we, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> we should talk about
questions, funny stories. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, like just, I
guess, memorable story. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It doesn't necessarily have to be funny, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but just like some memorable stories. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Would like a convention survival guide. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean we could do that.
- Sure, sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm sure we'll keep
working up stories that way. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, I feel like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here's the real privilege lads, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have never, I've only
gone to like one convention </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> like not as like a guest or like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> before I was a YouTuber essentially. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I feel like my experience
of Connor is like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> vastly different from other people's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause like I feel like as
an attendee AX is like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Here he goes, here he goes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess, okay, when you hear the lines </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are like five hours to get in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I mean, let's be honest,
we can apply for the badge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just lets us like walk in, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> We can just walk right in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Or we can just jump right into it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we can jump right into the pit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not gonna lie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you told me I had a line
of five hours to get to AX, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd be like, "Nah, I'm going home." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- I'm going home. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What I don't understand
about some people in AX </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is the people who are
willingly waiting three hours </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> to get to a panel.
- Oh, fuck that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, like a premiere
or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just thinking,
you know, I like anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> but that shit is gonna be
on Crunchyroll like a month. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I can wait a month, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't need to be at the
premiere, unless it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, I get a pass or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What was it the My Hero
Academia movie last year </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> or the year before had like a
four hour line or something? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Something ridiculous
like that, I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> "Guys, it's gonna it's
gonna be on Crunchyroll </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in like two weeks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The only reason I watched
the Promare movie was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> because someone from GKIDS
and Trigger got me in. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, I'm not queuing four hours. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Are you kidding me, no, way." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't care you could be like
the second coming of Christ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'll be like, "Five hour
long, nah, get outta here man." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you know how many Chick-fil-A's
I can get in that time? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you know how many beers
I can drink in five hours? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Like come on, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I gotta have a good time and five hours. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You could just go down
to the fucking bar or park, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is what I spend most my
time doing now at conventions. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Just like talking to different people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and catching up with different people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause that to me is the real
conventionalizing experience. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's the convention itself, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but after I'd say about
two conventions I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "I just rather just talk to people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or I just talk to other animators </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> rather than going to the
actual convention itself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you ever try and get
people in to staff with you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if they don't have like the badge? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah, all the time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, I love like
seeing like right, bullshit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all right, he rides with me, he's with me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He just got back pass. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like VIP access. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, you with me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You wanna like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - He's like, "My friend and
what's your name again?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - John.
- Yeah, John. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "I thought you were like four friends?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, fuck here
we go I got Trump balls, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, they're all part of the Japanese-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, security guards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you like think of
some bullshit on the thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have four managers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You gotta hope, like I think the problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is with some conventions
like AX that problem is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not my problem good thing for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they've so many volunteers,
the volunteers don't know shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you can just bullshit to them like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You're in line, you're
with me, it's cool, cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Get her in, get her in." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, if anything at Anime Expo, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've found that there's
always at least one volunteer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> who knows who I am. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they'll let you in.
- They just let me in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, "Oh, Anime Man I follow you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> come in bro, come in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, yeah, you have five
other people behind you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come in fuck it, you're probably
friends with them, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they'll ask you to take a picture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and while you're like
smuggling your friend in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel bad, you know, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I think one thing to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like nail down is the
difference between Anime Expo </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and basically every other convention. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like Anime Expo
exists in its own bubble. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think like everyone
should experience Anime Expo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for like once 'cause it's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's kinda like not even a
convention at this point, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's kinda like a convention
and a business expo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all at once, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you kinda get a
little bit of everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a little bit of nothing as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because if you don't
plan yourself correctly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> then you just end up experiencing lines. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a cluster fuck in every
sense of the worst, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Especially for like
some people who are like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Yeah, this is AX, good
I'm planning to go alone." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Do not go to AX alone." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like--
- Define good? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, "You could
probably go to Comic Con alone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and probably make something out of it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> but in AX everyone already
has that group with them, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it's like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like you don't have
enough time to hang out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> with the group that you have already, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let alone hanging out
with like random ones, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Fuck, I just had like so many flashbacks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> of who I was hanging
out with random people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that went terribly wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause okay, you've all been there, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone goes to convention, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, you've gotta decide, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really wanna go to this convention, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but fuck hotel rooms are expensive, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it's like how many people
can I fit in this hotel room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to reduce it to a point
where I'm comfortable, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And we said this on my podcast where like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're in charge the booking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you get dibs on the bed, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that's why I used to be
in charge of the bookings, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "I'm getting the
bed, I'm getting the best bed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm getting the key." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All you guys are getting the floor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause oh my God, if
the hotel doesn't ask you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how many keys you want, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like there's two
keys between six of you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like how do we-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do we distribute? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do we decide who gets a key? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Like I book it, I book it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - The person with the key has the power. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because you can come and go as you want, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> because there's nothing
worse than just sitting there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> with all your bags being
like calling up your mate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not fucking picking up and you're, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> "I wanna go back to the hotel
room answer me you cunt." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like mobile service in the
conventional it's fucking-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God, awful.
- It's non existent. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's non existent.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - You just basically gotta
pretend you're back into like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the fucking 18th century. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like how do I contact Joey, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> especially when you're in America, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we don't have American phones either. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like I have a contract on my British phone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that gives me American
service which is usable </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> in most places, but in like a convention, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you are getting like zero fucking service. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a fucking
Greek marathon, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> You have to ask someone
to like can you run </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to the outside of the convention </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and tell Joey that I'm here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "All right, I'll see you soon." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you ever stayed in a room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> with people who you're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Fuck, I regret staying
in a room with them." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I'm not gonna name names. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can I name your name, all right fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't name my names, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but I mean, you stayed with
some Discord people, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, started with a
bunch of people on Discord </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and that was fucking nightmare. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds like a nightmare. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was fucking, I was like
the pseudo leader of the group. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And there's just so
many fucking problems </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and this is also when
I just started YouTube </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and I hadn't formally met, I met you, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> no, I met Sydney, I didn't get to see you, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but we were gonna hang
out we had planned to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I hadn't met you yet, had I? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't think so. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, this was kinda like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how I was
like gonna make mates. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, I was planning
to hang out with you guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> for the majority of it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, was this the first AX then? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - The first AX I went to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You spend most of your time with us. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- I remember that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So I told the people
I was staying with like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Hey, this is like straight
up just like a room thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm gonna be hanging out with other people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like for like 99% of this." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Told them that like many times. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think like one of them
didn't quite get the memo </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and he was like really hoping
that I would introduce him </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to like everyone and be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Yo, he's my best mate, he's heeeey." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And the more nos, he was a fucking creep. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So like, I didn't even
wanna hang out with him. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And it wasn't like, at
first he was a little strange, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, he was an American </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was like a military dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And in my experience
military dudes are like 50/50 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on whether they're like totally chilled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> or fucking psychotic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I actually totally agree. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I've met so many military dudes
and there is no in between. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's no in between. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Either they're a fucking psycho </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or they're the most chillest
dude you can ever imagine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everywhere I've met
it's always like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like they're no chill.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So he's like kinda nice,
you know, he's a little weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like one time I remember
I met you at a party </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then like he was
texting me the whole time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think I mentioned where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was actually leaving this party. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you remember this?
- Yeah, I remember this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We go outside and he's
waiting there at like 1:00 a.m., </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's like, "Hey, Connor how
are you doing man, can I join?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we're like getting
an Uber and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "No, man, we gotta Uber somewhere else. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm really sorry, man." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's like how do you introduce, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like kinda creepy 'cause
everyone has already seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that he's waiting outside, it's
really creepy and it like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's the over enthusiasm, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause the thing about anime conventions </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's so difficult for a lot of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to like wrap their heads
around is just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what is socially accepted,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Social rules are thrown
out the window definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When you don't know someone, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I think it's like a social rule </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> when you shouldn't be
bringing your friends in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unless you have like a reason to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But if you don't, like okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you bring someone into a friend group </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that guy is an asshole
or a creep that's on me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's on you.
- That's on me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I brought him in.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I didn't know him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I got kind of signs
that he was a creep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I didn't wanna bring
him in 'cause I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> if I bring him to this party </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and he starts like fucking
chatting up Gigguk all night </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like, "Hey, man, I love your
videos can we take a pic </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and can I smell your penis?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like kinda looks terrible
on me, so I was like nah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And the party was at my house or- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Your Airbnb and there's like 10 of us, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> so it's really intimate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I told him I was like, "Listen, man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm really sorry dude, but I
don't really know like Garnt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> or anyone in this group pretty
well, I would invite you, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I just don't feel comfortable doing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I explained to him and
he was so pissed off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He was pissed off? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He was so pissed off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So then I came back at like
5:00 a.m. to my shitty hotel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like, it's the suburbs
of LA and like it was-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was like the Korea town, wasn't it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it's further away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like, even like further
out, it was really far out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was really sketchy, it was like a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what is it called, it
wasn't even like a holiday, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was one of the even
the more budget chains. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was bad, it was really bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And at this hotel for
some reason at midnight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the cards reset. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So if you came back after midnight, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd go to the front desk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the front desk wasn't open. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So if you came back after midnight, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd hope someone else
is already in the room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or just wait out your door till 6:00 a.m. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> till someone comes.
- What? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, it's stupid. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So he was in the room </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and he'd been like
drinking alone in his room </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I felt really bad, but so I'm like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Hey, man, let me in, let me in." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Whatever, you know, it's
like 5:00 a.m. like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Dude I really wanna fucking sleep." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> So he opens the door and
comes out block, oh shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> blocking the door so I couldn't get in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, "Yo, what the
fuck man like, let me in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna sleep it's 5:00 a.m. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and he's like absolutely hammered. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He's like, "Listen Connor,
I saw your call man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Why didn't let me in the party?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, "Dude I'm so sorry
but not now man it's 5:00 a.m. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> let me sleep."
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We can talk about in the morning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Dude, please let me
sleep and then whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> So then we slept whatever
finally he let me in, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I thought it's weird that he was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was ignoring him, I'm
trying to open the door, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> he's blocking me and I'm
like, "What the fuck man? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let me in, it's fine man, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I paid for this room let me sleep." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And like near the end one of
the other peoples in my room, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who was like a lot smaller and like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I guess he thought they were cute </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they called me up and he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, he just tried to
pay me to suck his dick." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "What the fuck!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "What is happening
in this hotel room?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - What?
- Yikes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "I'm so fucking glad
I didn't introduce you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to any of my friends if you
turn around asking people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to suck your dick for
money are you kidding me?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, needless to say I went to
the hotel room just explained </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> to him like, "Hey, what the fuck man? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Don't do that you asshole? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like this is my friend don't
make them uncomfortable." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he didn't do anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he went stayed somewhere
else like the last night </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Dude, don't stay in this room with them." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so, I've never stayed with
any random people on Discord </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> that I've never met before ever again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've heard so many horror
stories from Discord. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what it is about Discord. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm gonna call it
like the Discord hotel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Those never ever go right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I've, 'cause even
like the best you can do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is have like a little bit of drama, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but there's never zero drama. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Nobody ever comes out
there with just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah, everyone was just chilled, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we had the most chillest time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone was understanding,
you know what I'm saying?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is about everything
that's planned on Discord </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just ends up horrible? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> What is it about? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because you can't like really
know who's weird on Discord. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the problem is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is that you don't really
know how weird people are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> until you meet them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You also, it's doubly
true on Discord as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> where you're here for this like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you're here for this
server, which is like solely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> where you talk about this one, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know, common interests or whatever </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you you rarely talk
about your own personality-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just don't understand
the mentality though of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> looking at a Discord group and being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "Okay, there's three other people in here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> never seen their faces-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't care 'cause I-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Never met them before, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna stay in a room with
them over night, it's like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I was broke Joey
what do you want from me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like at least like, you know,
hang out with them outside. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I understand to all the
conventioner out there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who've done the same thing as me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause you're broke as fuck! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like you gotta do what you gotta do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And plus, I knew I could
take care of myself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I don't have time,
like I didn't worry, but I, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, if I hear like 18
year old girls that do it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like, whoa, with dudes, I'm whoa. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean that's just
calling for a disaster. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, like it's a
recipe for disaster, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Because I've only stayed in,
I've only gone to conventions </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> after I had like a full time job. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - So even if it wasn't
like a great paying job </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> at least I could just
afford my own hotel room </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff like that or like
just a really cheap motel room, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But if I had gotten before
I was like say 21, 22 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> when I was just a broke uni
student or just God, forbid, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like before even uni, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I can imagine so many horrible situations </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that could have arose of this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which kinda like there's no
real way to protect yourself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> around that especially
if you're just roaming </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with random people on Discord, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is such a coin flip, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yes.
- And I would argue like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is the anime con really that worth it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it is.
- Honestly? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, you know
what, all that weird shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that happened to side that I
don't think I told you guys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> that whatever, but, yeah, I
mean, all of that weird shit </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the side that I had to deal with, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll fucking do it again easy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But you'll fucking do anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, that was fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, like the convention was fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> That was a nuisance, but, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it's nice exercise
knowing that I can tell someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to fuck off, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, what, I
mean, it is what it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I knew that when I did
that there was a chance </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that it could go horribly wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it did go horribly wrong
and I learned my lesson, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm not doing that again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you said you would
if you have the chance? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I mean, I said I
understand if, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you're like 18, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you got like 200 bucks max to your name. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The fare ticket is 50
bucks, you've gotta get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that hotel room down to 100 bucks somehow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It doesn't matter how many
people are gonna go in that room. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You gotta divide the room
with the amount of bodies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that will fit in it, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If you need to sleep on the
floor, you sleep on the floor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> People who sleep on the
bed they pay a premium. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Most of the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mostly it's like a fucking
human trafficking lodge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you ever been to a
fucking convention room Joey? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Jesus Christ, like a fucking
bomb could go off in there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it would be less messy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like the amount of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, if you've got
a cos player in there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say goodbye to floor space, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> say goodbye to fucking floor space. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - The same reason they are allergic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to closing their fucking suitcase </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it has to be wide
open the whole fucking time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't close it, okay, fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, I don't know, I mean, it's whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> You should try it some time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, thank you, I can
afford my own hotel room. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I good dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - For the frills, do you
fucking roll that dice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or do you just roll with it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Who knows what story you'll get. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - You gonna get through somehow, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, okay, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I like I know this sounds like super, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I guess it sounds weird or
dangerous to some people, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I love just meeting new
people in that kind of way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, look I don't mind
meeting new people either, but-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't mind meeting a new
person for the first time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in my hotel room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I don't wanna pull a gotcha role </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where I might end up, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sleeping with a fucking
murderer, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't mind, I'll take that odd. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> You might get the fucking
coolest friend for life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> by doing that, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's other ways to meet
cool friends for life man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you get that fucking story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> of we met at anime convention, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> You'll do anything to content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love a-
- Spoken like a true YouTuber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just know, I don't even
think of it as content, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I just love like the idea
of like making a friend </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> through such a weird
and unconventional way </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where I feel like it makes
such a good friendship, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I get that, but that's
another coin for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like I'm somewhere
in the middle of both of you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I do like meeting new people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I used to be that guy who
was just like up for anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and be like, "Yeah,
I'll go meet Donald like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in a dark alleyway whatever." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But like, I've had like enough
bad experiences to be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what, maybe I'll do
like a just a little bit of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a background check before I
jump right into it, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, oh my God, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Met several people on
Discord who turned out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be really sketchy.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I just gotta, there's
a lot of dudes on Discord </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who like underage girls </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you just gotta call that shit out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> when you see any signs of it, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I feel like a lot of, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> especially in anime conventions, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of people especially
obviously like anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, anime fans and
weebs and everything, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> they don't have the
confidence to confront people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when they see some shit happening. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I feel like with a
lot of convention stories </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that I've heard, it's it's
mostly bogged down to people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just people just didn't know
how to handle the situation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they've never seen
it happen in front of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so the first time you experienced it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just kinda just freeze up to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what is this happening
now, is this happening now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And no matter what you tell yourself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> you're going to do at that moment, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> you're totally unprepared for that moment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I would say like, the
best advice I could give is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you see anything bad happening, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like don't let that shit lie, call it out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also, especially if
they're your friends. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I know a lot of people
who are like it's hard to like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you know, call out your
friend and be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Dude, what the fuck!" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You gotta call that shit out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like if you let it slide,
they'll just keep doing it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - A good friend will call. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - We gotta stop this shit out of community </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> because we saw what happened
to this slash community, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And I don't know what's
happened behind the scene </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the anime community. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah, I don't wanna imagine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't wanna imagine it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I wasn't part of the community </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when some of the worst stories </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that happened behind the scenes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, yeah, we'd
like to see a YouTuber </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that I used to do stuff with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and I've had people on Discord
who I considered friends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who later on found out
that they'd like did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some fucking horrible stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, honestly, there
were like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there were signs and I just ignored it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I was like, "Oh, well,
I mean, I think, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're just quirky, they're
not gonna hurt anyone." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just gotta call that shit out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you see it unfortunately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So even if it's your friend,
please call them out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and bring them out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Especially if it's a friend, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> only through the internet
'cause, you know, we, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, we all met through
the internet, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I mean, we've also met in real life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we've hang out so many times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before I've really knew
your guys' real personality </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everything like that, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So if it's some guy or some
girl you've met through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the internet, especially if
it's Discord or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you've only talked to
them through the internet, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> meeting friends, making
friends on the internet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is completely fine, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but understand that
that's totally different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from being at friend Irl. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And until you've hang out Irl a few times, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you really can't have a true
grasp of their personality </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and what they might be like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And that's why it's
always such a gamble, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like when you meet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> again, like when you meet
that person on Discord </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, let's go to
a convention together." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you'll be hanging out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with a completely different person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, this is like,
"Oh, you weren't like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when we were chatting on
Discord what the fuck!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And I've had a lot of
experiences like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I would be talking to someone online </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I'd be like,
"Oh, you're going to AX, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, I'm going to AX as well,
let's meet up and hang out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I talked to them I'm like, "Wow!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You aren't what I expected at all? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you are not the same
person I texted two days ago." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah.
- Man, fuck! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - For better or worse, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes they're way cooler in real life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes they're just
like, oof in real life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And there's so many
social norms that you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why, I get like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Tell the all of the
dumb shit that's happened. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Common sense just doesn't
seem to like make sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like common sense just isn't common </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in anime conventions, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Especially when it comes to
like meeting people and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you talked about, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the introducing the one friend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like your friend group or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What will happen if you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> you're going to this party, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And you can be like, okay, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you can bring like this one friends </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that you might wanna
kinda wanna introduce, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but they're with a group
of like five, six people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And they're like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Can you like get all
these people in as well?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're like, "Ugh!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is it about these
people who are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, plus one, also plus
one group of friends, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> That's what it means,
yeah, all right, cool. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I got like seven people back there." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's hard 'cause
obviously I don't wanna be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah, you know, only
one person can come in, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I also gonna have the
balls to do something like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd be like, "All right mates, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I've got a sick invitation from a guy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna go to that, I
hope you'll understand." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that's what I would do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll be like, "Hey, man,
I got an opportunity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I don't really get come
across often, can I take it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Please, don't be mad at me." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, I think
it's just understanding </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that it's a convention. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> People, you know, you're
not always gonna hang out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> with the same friend group all the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I feel like if you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you have like some other
people you wanna meet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then I feel like you just let them go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't feel betrayed by
your friend hang out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with other people whatever. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> - You can use ExpressVPN

<SPEAKER_06> that are only available

<SPEAKER_06> - For example, I used
ExpressVPN the other day </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because Netflix Japan doesn't have any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of the Harry Potter movies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So--
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, weirdly enough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I wanted to watch some Harry Potter, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I flicked on ExpressVPN,
set it to the UK as you do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and boom, all of the Harry Potter movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Netflix Japan doesn't
have English subtitles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> or anime sometimes, so I
have to go actually, no joke, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to the VPN to be in the UK,
so I can watch the anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's in Japan with
the English subtitles. </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you so much ExpressVPN, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back to the video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Speaking of inappropriate, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the most inappropriate
thing happened to me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at a UK convention surprisingly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think I've told this
story like a million times, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> but fuck it we'll say it here again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the one where like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right, I think I should
tell the story as it happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In order, naturally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm just finished with a panel, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, killed it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> answered all these questions like a boss, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't heard that phrase in a while. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow, was this 2004?
- Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So and then when you're done
with the panel, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, all right, I'll
take pictures outside, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, in the line. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm taking pitches and
the first one comes up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first girl, she's like 14, 13. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm taking a picture
and she's like smiling like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, by the way, can I grab your ass?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, this one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I'm like, I'm like, "What? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Do you know what you
just said little girl?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And she was like, I was
like, "No, I think, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Why would you ask that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, well, okay, whatever." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So and then, you know, next picture, fine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> next picture fine and as I'm
taking this next picture, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel this like grip, like
a tightening on my ass, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like, and its getting-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Alien space. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This grip, this grip,
gets like fucking iron clad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> on my ass and then I'm like
turning around I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey, what the fuck!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I said, oh,
because I turned around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and she's just like, like this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like what are
you doing in my head. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, ah, 'cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "How the fuck do I react to this?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't wanna swat her away like a fly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, begone.
- Don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I was like, what the? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So she grabbed it and
then when I turned around, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she fucking ran off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "What the fuck!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm looking at the
guy who's helping me out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like "Yo, what the fuck was that?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "What the fuck!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he went to look after, like, go after, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and to like toddle her off, but she went. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How many years ago was this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like three or four. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is this like MCMs? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, this is like a
really small London one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> the tiny one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause like a similar
thing happened to me at, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it was some of the, one
of the early MCMs, okay? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And I was, so I was having a meetup. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was like one of one
of my very first meetups </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it was just as I like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just after I started dating Syd, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so it was like Sydney's first
UK anime convention as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so I was having this meetup </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and we were taking
pictures and everything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then this girl comes take a picture </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you can immediately
you can immediately tell </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that she was not respecting
my personal boundaries, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> she was very, very touchy feely-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They're the worst. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, and Sydney is
like raised her eyes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lasered in on it immediately, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Immediately, I could feel
like the death Claire </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on this girl without having
to look at Sydney, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like in the middle of the fucking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like Harry Potter Voldemort
like, "You wanna battle?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I know that Sydney
is watching everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and she's like being really
touchy feely and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm trying to just be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, you know, I have
my personal boundaries. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll take a picture and everything." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so, we go in for the picture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she like goes on
for like a full on hug. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, I'm just there being like, hey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she just grabs me like
that and just hugs me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I didn't need to
see where Sydney's face was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I could feel it, I could feel it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then afterwards I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, yeah, thank you for
coming to my meetup." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she goes in for a fucking kiss </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I had to like turn my cheek. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I turn my cheek in time,
but she goes for my mouth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I turns-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - She goes for your mouth? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and she hits my cheek. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I just hear Sydney, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I've never heard Sydney
make this noise ever again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but she fucking hissed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - She's a fucking snake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, she's like, "Ssssss!" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - What does it do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know and then
same, same as your girl, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she just fucking runs off
before I could say anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, "What just happened? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What am I supposed to
do in this situation?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what the worse part was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> when I got home that day,
I go on fucking Twitter </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and she replied to my tweet being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Hi, I'm the girl who grabbed
your ass, it felt good." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "First of all, thank you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Second of all, what the fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, you know that's,
I reply, like be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Dude, that was super
fucking inappropriate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You shouldn't do that." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And she was like, "Oh, I didn't realize." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like--
- I didn't realize? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck you didn't realize, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like what kind of
family were you raised in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> where it's like, oh, yes, hello, sir? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What are you really doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like fucking measuring your
foam every fucking day? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Why are you--
- Which year was this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh shit, this must have
been like 2000, fuck, 16, 17. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, I feel like
'cause I have a similar story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that happened around that time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You do?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the fuck! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, well, my mine was in about 2016. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We all fucking survived
something here, God damn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mine was around like 2017, it was at AX. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And this is, I had just like,
started going out with Aki, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> but this is before we went public. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So this is like the
convention that I met Aki </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and that was like two days,
like literally two days </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> after we decided like, "Okay,
let's start going out." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And we were doing a signing together. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This fucking girl comes up to
me and she's dressed in like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it was like Monica
Michael* or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but she had like a giant wand, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like a massive like stuff
and she puts it down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and she's like, "Hi, Joey." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Oh, no, it's
one of these kinds of girls." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> All right, "Hey, what's up?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she's like, "Can you sign the stuff?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Yeah, sure." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I start signing it and then she's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Also here's a question but
can I be an Anime Expo Waifu?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just kind of stopped and-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How to trigger a flight
of anime, Jesus Christ! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - And the moment she said that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I just kind of stopped
and looked up I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Could you say that again please?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause in my head I'm starting to panic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and same with Sydney, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I could feel the fucking
glare of Aki right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on my fucking neck. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I didn't even have to look over, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I know you're staring at me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And of course right, I
have the pressure from here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the pressure right
in front of me, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's two women staring at me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for totally different reasons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And I just fucking panic, all right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I couldn't like, 'cause
at that point I was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I couldn't say like yeah sure jokingly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because my woman is fucking glaring at me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The no right answer in that situation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I also couldn't say no right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I don't wanna hurt her feelings </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and she lined up, you know,
all this time to like meet me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I just fucking panicked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I said I don't know I got ranks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> You didn't have to murder her like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got ranks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And then she replied back being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Then can I come to the
top of the ranking?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I said-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Girl you gotta learn to give up, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, and I was like,
"Ah, I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it takes time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just bullshitting this entire time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the moment she's like,
"Oh, okay no worries." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Again, tried to go in for a kiss </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and I just fucking like dogged that shit, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so she only got me on the
chick and then she walked off. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then Aki under her breath was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> "What did you mean by ranks?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like I'm sorry, I paniced. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What are you supposed to
say in that situation? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There is no right answer, but-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was no right answer, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but I definitely said the
most incorrect answer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was definitely the wrong answer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I felt so bad, I was like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just politely decline and be
like, "Oh, thank you but no." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know, but like I was at that stage </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> where I like I really couldn't say no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it was at that point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I didn't know any better, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That was like probably like my
second signing session ever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you mean like the
story I told was Sydney </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where you don't know how
to react in the situation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you don't know how to react </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and because you don't wanna
like make them upset, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because they've lined up all this time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> you're like, "You fucking lined up for me? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like I'm not anything special." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So like that was at the
point as well where like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> any absurd thing that they would request, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I would just fucking do it
just to make them happy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> So I remember like at this
like Canada convention, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first dude that
came up to me was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Can you sign my ass?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Oh, okay." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like I thought it was
like just his pants, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> This guy fully fucking
ducks like his pants off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Shows his-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - In the middle of the
convention fucking booth? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - First dude in the line
plants his bear us on the table </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and was like, "Sign here." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did you fucking wipe
down this table afterwards? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You gonna need some mad sanitation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, you know, there's
a bottle of hand sanitizer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in case of anything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just fucking emptied
this shit, sanitize. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's so disgusting.
- I know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I would vomit on his ass. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, so like I signed him making sure </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> not to actually touch his
ass like with my hand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I did it and I was like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I need one of those like
garbage picking up things </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and just like fucking-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just the tongs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, the tongs
like from far away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Wear like a radioactive
suit on, Jesus Christ! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, you know, that again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that was the point where-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is wrong with anime fans? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know.
- What the fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I didn't know
any, and same convention </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as the guy who planted his ass, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there was another girl who came up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she looked really fucking-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just what fucking convention was this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think this was OtaKuthon in Montreal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And then this girl came up, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> looked and sounded really
fucking normal, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Until she said, "Can you sign my arm?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And she had like, drawn out like a box </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for me to sign on the arm. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, oh, that's kind of weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "I have a piece of paper." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she's like, "No, no, I
want you to sign my arm." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just had a lot of people
to go through, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I just fucking signed it for her. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Oh, do you
want like a piece of paper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for me to sign it on?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She's like, "Oh, no, no, it's okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm getting this tattooed." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I did a really shitty job ass well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This was like the most messed
up signature I've ever done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like "No, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Please don't do that, I'm begging you." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually said like, "I'm
begging you don't fucking do it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And she's like, "Okay,
I'll think about it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "No, no, no,
no, don't think about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just fucking, I don't know." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just don't do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know what it, like,
but that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, I don't know, if it's because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of my lack of experience of
being in situations like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> or just the fact that
conventions have gotten </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so much more calm in
the last like five years </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or it's a combination of both </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> because you don't hear that kind of shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like last year, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I feel like things are way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> more regulated now honestly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I remember first
time going to conventions, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like some of my first signings, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was kind of like anything
goes, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like last year, they
had like a ticketing system </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or maybe it was a year before that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they had like a
proper ticketing system </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I remember I'd be booked out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to do signings for like an hour </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then it would end up going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like two hours and a half. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And there was nothing that
like regulated what was okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and what wasn't okay,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess that's like the benefit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> of the big conventions, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that because there are so many people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they probably know
how popular you are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Then they're like if you're
signing session is one hour, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then it's fucking one hour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and they'll be cutting off the line. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I think also, I think people, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's gotten more in people's
ideas or in people's heads now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that just because you're
at an anime convention, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> social norms still do exist </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I remember in the before time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and I can't imagine what it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like even before I started
going to conventions, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it seemed like going
to an anime conventions, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like all rules fell out the window. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> You could get away with anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I watched
footage of like Anime Expo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and like fucking 2005, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And like, you know, that was during like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the whole like, glomp and like, yaoi, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> like, you know, yaoi pad
thing and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I can't imagine fucking being
there and like staying sane. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, I don't wanna like walk through </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the convention hall with the
fear that a random person </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is gonna jump dive at me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's like, "Well, AX glomp." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It sounds like an anime convention </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to like a survival horror. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Who's gonna invade my personal space now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like personally actually
drown on everyone now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like who's next? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like it's pretty
came from a place of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I assumed that it
was the one time of the year </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> where they would get to meet anime fans. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Unlike outside of that you
didn't get to see them, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like--
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But now I mean, everyone's
a fucking anime fan. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, I think that's what it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's mainstream now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All now is everyone goes
to a place to buy anime merch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and get drunk together. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- Pretty much, pretty much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it's like, I
understand that back then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably was a little over the top </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because this is the only fucking chance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> you get to be a fucking weeb. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like every other day of the
year you can't be a weeb, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> otherwise you gonna get bullied. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I feel like the
golden period for me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for anime conventions where it was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you could get away with
things that were like fun, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I feel like the point where it starts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to get really, really regulated
was around 2016 onwards ish. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, as it should 'cause there was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> so much sketchy shit
happening in the background. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, there was a little
sketchy shit happening around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, that was around the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> when the whole like cosplay
isn't consent with anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which came out right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, why would you
even need to write that out? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That like is a failure on
humanity that was a rule. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which we need to see
implement this rule that's-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, is like, oh, yes, I
need something written down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> on paper to know that being
overly sexual towards cosplays </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is a bad thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah exactly, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like fucking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I remember like,
'cause I've been going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to London MCM Expo for
like a fair few years now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember when, so to
explain the London MCM Expo </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like the biggest kind of-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Kind of pretty fucking
terrible convention. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a convention inverted commas </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause it's more like an, it is an expo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just anime stuff and
there's not really anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to do there if you're like a fan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's kind of like you can buy stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and pretty much all anyone does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is just hang out with their friends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly.
- [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So there's this grass beds in MCM, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> outside of the convention
center, which everywhere used to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where everyone used to hang
out and I was closed off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but I feel like some of
my best memories were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when people were just doing like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the most random shit on that grass. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, the alcohol bottles--
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Were you there that year
where there was the, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they did that that Fight Club? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, okay.
- They did a Fight Club? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, so-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know why I
have a mental image of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a bunch of weebs beating
each other up is hilarious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like retro music blasting like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was a fight club, but
it was like a fight club. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> So, it was like the
equivalent of a mosh pit </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or something like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But I remember there was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, there was obviously the usual, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, you got the fucking
Jedis drooling itself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I remember the funniest one I saw was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was these two anime fans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and one was like the
scrawniest short anime fan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> who was like vitamin D deficient. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, that stereotype. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That really sick dude, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Skeletal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's skeletal and then
on the other side was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the fucking biggest, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> he wasn't like obese, but
let's say he was a big lad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- He was a big lad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hefty fella.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this was like the most
uneven fight I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Like forget about weight
classes here, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait, till they started
punching each other. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, I guess they just tried </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to like make each other fall over, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> So this the scrawny skinny
dude fucking full on sprints </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> into this guy tried to like push him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he just fucking bounces
off him like he's in like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like he's playing four
guys or something, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And the guy just sits on him. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that's was the end of the fight. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Were they all drunk? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yes, everyone was drunk. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just crushes the poor guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So the convention ends at like 6:00, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but that area is still
full of people drinking, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like they're just outside
just getting drunk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It sounds awesome. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I would love to be there
just like a spectator. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's kind of fiesta, it's kind of-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's kind of fiesta,
but now it's like a little </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> more controlled version
you can get away with which </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is a bit of a shame because I liked, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I liked that kind of thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was literally like
an off licence in a Tesco </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> within like 100 meters of it so-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, that's not good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - People are just buying,
buying, buying drinks, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> drinks, drinks and it's like it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think the hotel hated it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause there's literally
a hotel right outside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that are like what are you doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why are you fucking getting drunk? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why is this dude sitting
on this scrawny kid? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why is there a fight club? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why are people cheering? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it was that fight
club that made the convention </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> actually called off
thinking of the grass area. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It was worth it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Anyone who was on that
MCM convention knows that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that fight club was hilarious as fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that sounds fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Health and safety issues aside. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is fun when you
walk to MCM convention, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you see something that
clearly will get shut down </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> within an hour, you're like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "I'm just gonna sit and watch this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If this shit go down, this
shit is gonna be funny." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I see that shit even
regularly at Anime Expo still </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> to this day, like
outside of the West Wing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, where all the cosplay are, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I see some shit there where
I'm just like, "Why, why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Where are the staff,
who's regulating this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can we talk about
how fucking crazy it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like meeting people who watch your videos, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so fucking surreal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How fucking weird is that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I never get used to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm like, now I have
like a conditioned response </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I could be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, this is how I should
respond to like fans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Activating execution 101. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's why--
- Activating McDonald's smile. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's why getting
recognized anywhere, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but conventions you're
so unprepared for it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you just never
get used to that fear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'm just like, "Man,
I'm just a fucking dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who talks about anime online." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, it's already surprising
when people at conventions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like come up to you and recognize you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But what's weird is where
you're like nowhere near </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a fucking convention and it's
just like a random like guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or girl who's just sees, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that fucking dude in Singapore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God, oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Can I tell that story? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you can tell it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Go ahead, go ahead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so we were at
Singapore convention. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it was anime, what was it called? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Anime Festival of Asia
or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, AFA, AFA. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're at AFA, Singapore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And we were in this, we were
outside the convention working, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we were getting lunch or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was me Sydney and Joey I believe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And Alan I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And Alan, and Alan, yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So there are four of us there
and we were just walking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in one of the, in just like
this random shopping mall. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then we just hear this screech. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> This is like, this is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this is like the loudest screech
I've ever heard in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like a banshee screech. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you would have thought
like someone came through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with like a truck and was
like running people over. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was that loud.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it immediately
triggered my flight of fight </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like instincts, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everybody turned around
like what the fuck! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And all we see is this
fucking kid bolting it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> towards Joey, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, like time just
fucking stopped at that moment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Am I about to
witness my fucking friend dying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in front of my eyes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is he about to get stabbed or something?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the dude was full
on like assassins creeding me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like just fucking like lows fuck like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like running towards
me through this giant crowd. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And as the crowd is parting
you can see this kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just coming straight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Oh, he's coming
for me, I'm gonna die." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And because he's like
Naruto running almost, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't see his hands right, so I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "This guy is probably got a knife. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like he's about to stab me." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm just prepared to die. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He stops like right here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> He screeches to a halt and
he says, "I love you Joey." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, meanwhile, poop is
falling out of my pants, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Meanwhile, we're just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Ah, okay, Joey is not dead, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Ah, hold on." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds terrifying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course, he was terrifying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - And he's like, "Can
you take a photo of me?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did like Felix say one time
like Southeast Asian fans </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> are like the craziest--
- Yeah, they are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In public they just scream?
- Absolutely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shout out to the Southeast Asian fans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Everything was great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's only like a whole
different level from like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like any convention
we've been to in America. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like I remember watching Joey walk </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> from one panel to
another, it was basically </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> like watching Justin Bieber
walk through like, like a pre-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's gonna be an ego booster. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, it felt pretty
good, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love it when you're just like chilling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then like someone
in the line she's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> "Oh, you Joey?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> "Yeah, yeah, I am." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think as well like it
might have been because like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that Singapore AFA was, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a first for that
convention for a lot of reasons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I think I was
like the first YouTuber </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that had ever been invited. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And also, I was the first
ever guest at that convention </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that didn't charge for signatures. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And like, 'cause like I
remember when I was sitting there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like waiting, the staff was
like, "All right, so tell me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how much do the signings cost?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, "What are you talking about?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He's like, "How much does it cost? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like five dollars, $10 how much is it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So that I can tell people in the line?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "It's free." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And like--
- What do you mean is free? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, he was like,
"What, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> What mean its free." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - They couldn't process that.
- They couldn't process it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He was like, "What do you mean it's free?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "It's fucking free." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I felt like some
other guests get annoyed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when YouTubers turn up and don't charge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause they're like, "Why
are you just devaluing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're making us look like ripoffs." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] I mean, yeah,
I guess I understand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it's just like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I'm selling something
like a print or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like I brought an art. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but that's the
thing, I was selling prints </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I was doing a collab
with like three studios, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's like, people can
just fucking buy this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I feel like if they, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I shouldn't charge
someone to sign something, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they've already paid the
entrance fee to get in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then they're like
already buying like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the merch that I came up with, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's like, I'm not gonna
charge them anymore, fuck that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like the guy who sneezed on set </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> on Star Wars charged $50 for a shot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like what, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was following trouper number 1200. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like who the fuck are you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just I really disagree
with them doing that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they charge so much, I really hate it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's so conceded-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like give them
something physical, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like this should be like an item, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - My signature should not be worth money. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It should be like a
nice little memorabilia, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but I don't know anyone who fucking-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it completely destroys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the meaning of a signature, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like from a famous person, in my opinion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, I would just
I just feel bad charging. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, me too even if I'm like
the greatest fucking anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like the worst like I
would get away with is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, charging, I haven't
even like charged for prints </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything like that 'cause
I've never done prints, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but, or like-
- Print it's sold out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so print is sold out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but at least give them something physical </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that's what I would say.
- [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If, you know, we need
to do something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, right, but again, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> we're doing well enough for ourselves. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I'm not that fucking
desperate to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I have 500 prints, they all need to go." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I guess sometimes the
conventions can't really like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like pay you much for your
time, so it's like I get it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that some people wanna like
get some prints in there, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, to get them going. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - But, you know, that's not really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the reason I go to conventions-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no, I know what you're-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just wanna fucking meet my fans. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Anyway, any conventions in
Southeast Asia wanna invite us, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we are all--
- Any conventions in general. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Any conventions in
general, we are always open. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> We miss it so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - After this fucking
drought of conventions, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> we really need to fucking go to some. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, like crazy people
and inappropriate people aside </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like my God, I think that
thing is like anything better </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> than meeting someone who is
just like nice and just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Hey, I watch your videos." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause it's so crazy, 'cause
you don't really get to ever, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I know you two usually
say this all the time, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't get to see people
who watch our videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because when I see a video
that gets like 300,000 views, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, yeah, cool,
but then when you see-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whenever you see 300
people in your panel-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like that's crazy with
300 people in one room </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> who would wanna meet you
that like blows my mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then like most of them
are so fucking sweet, so nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "Man, I can't help
but just like you want a hug? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> You wanna hug?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's also just feel so nice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially when it's like
a small convention as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like the
ratio of like attendees </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to people who know you is like staggering. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's so hard to try
to voice your gratitude </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> without sounding like that
typical corny YouTuber, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but that's just that's-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I appreciate you guys so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You wanna hug, ask me I'll give you one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> probably even if you're sweaty,
I'll give you a fat hug. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I will give you a hug too. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just, pressured Garnt to saying that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Garnt doesn't do that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Garnt wasn't gonna give you
a hug until I said it first, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just wanna make that clear. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm not gonna give you a hug. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know, they're not ranked
enough for Joey size, sorry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I have ranks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, you know, that's
like the other thing as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, I don't wanna
like dwell on the whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like cosplays consent thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> But like, I feel that-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You can ask me for a
hug, I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, but like I feel that like now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like at least with me, my
general rule of thumb is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> especially if it's of the female, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, 'cause I know like,
dudes don't give a shit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if I hug them, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because it's just the fucking-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, yeah, let me cup your dick. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let me hold your balls.
- I'm joking don't do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Please don't do that that's a joke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Your balls are heavy too. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel that like because
of the whole thing with, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> especially recently like convs have become </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a little bit more sensitive like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> at least my general rule of thumb is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're a female or
you're not like a dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> who comes up to me and
like wants to take a photo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I always ask like, is it
all right if I put my hand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on you right shoulder, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like I wait for them to
be like, "Can I hug you?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do that but like sometimes
I forget and then I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fuck, I just did it without asking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Am I a horrible person, like
are they gonna go online </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and say if I can get killed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's only until the last AX </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> where I like physically
told myself I need to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> into the habit of doing that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, same with me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Like before I was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was just like trying to read the air, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> but now I just straight up
ask, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it used to just be like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jesus! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I used to just be like,
okay, I kind of get the vibe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that you're okay with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like that's just risky,
I don't know, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because a lot of them are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "Of course you can, why
is that even a question?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "No, you don't
understand, I have to ask." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause it's weird, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because now, because, you
know, when we started off, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think any YouTuber
ever thinks they're gonna get, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, any kind of attention
or any kind of success. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, you kind of come into it like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> the small person mentality. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, sometimes you just gotta realize </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that you can't get away with that anymore. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Unfortunately, even though
you still see yourself </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> as that same person who started off doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like YouTube videos in your
mom's basement or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I still feel like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I still feel like
that now, but you know-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Your numbers don't lie, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - You gotta adapt eventually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's sad, I mean, I
feel like I have to like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, in some aspects it makes you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like be a better person, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In general, like I've got an asshole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I will get called out for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is good, but
then also, I feel like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I have to make sure everything in my life </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is completely 100% like
there's no doubt in my mind, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> in anyone's mind that I'm
totally like in the clear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas most people it's like, okay, 90%, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 70% I'm not an asshole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like all right, that's enough, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah.
- But, you know, it's kind of, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and also, like I feel as
well when you meet fans </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sometimes they're really
nervous because obviously, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> they don't know you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like they're more nervous </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to put their arm around you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so, I feel like that
like waiting for you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to take the lead, which
is, you know, again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it makes it harder 'cause
like, I used to just be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right, I guess if they
seem like they want it like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, where they stand for
the photo because sometimes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, they'll just literally
just stand in position puff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like touching you basically,
okay, then you put your arm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- But yeah, some people-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I think that's
like another good reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> why like--
- You should ask. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I need to get the habit, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some of them are like,
"Oh, yeah, of course." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like they weren't expecting that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, I'm sure I'll come
on to this pandemic being like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm sure the pandemic would
change a lot of the behavior </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> about what's allowed and
everything like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - A million hold a hand photo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Although I do love to
have the hold a hand photo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> There's something about that, I don't-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause the best part is when they ask </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> for a hold hand photo I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "You get it, you get it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whenever I get someone ask me like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "Can you do a hold the hand?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "I can one* off
that let's do a hold a hug." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're just like doing this,
but you're not touching at all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fucking great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wonder if all conventions
will everyone be required </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to wear a mask when they finally-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably the first two years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, that depends on when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the conventions are gonna open. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly.
- True, true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I doubt that there will be
any conventions open next year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I just don't think,
I don't think the wall-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Didn't they hold on like
fucking Idaho or some shit? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, but I mean-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like in the middle of November. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly, but, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're gonna fucking
slammed for that, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, I don't think there'll be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> any big profile convention
happening to at least </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the second half the year that's like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And the whole conventions are like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Get that out of here, get that out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't wanna do an E-convention </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> are you kidding me, what's that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, I did a couple
of E-conventions this year. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you actually?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did one for, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did one for anime con South Africa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah, I saw that, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did like a pre-recorded
interview for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, sick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm like, I wanted to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the only reason why I wanted
to do that was because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when the pandemic is over, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I really wanna fucking go to South Africa. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's just like, it's
just connection building, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so it's like--. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey should play with five head here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I can't get myself to like attend. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Because like attending
conventions is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of like the equivalent of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're like watching
a food video or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're watching this like
these three star Michelin chef </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like produce this like
gorgeous looking food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you're sitting there
with like your combini meal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, "This is just the same." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is almost the same.
- This is almost the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're like tear open the
paper salt like, yeah, I'm good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My three star MSG. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you hate it when you
make a fucking great meal, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you got a great or maybe
you order new breeds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you fucking edit all
before like full minutes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into the like one hour
movie you gonna watch? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, fuck I'm gotta
put this plate away </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or it's gonna get dirty in my sink. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I shouldn't been, I
fucking hate that so much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know how to
pace myself with food. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't it, it's like the movies, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my popcorn eaten before we even we-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why I don't even
order the popcorn, all right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why don't you do that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> You fucking animal
- I don't order popcorn, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so good here, why
would you not want it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause its fucking awful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Popcorn is that thing
that I never get myself, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> but whenever someone
else's offers I'll do this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like have you guys
had any creepy experiences </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with people or fans? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Absolutely, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, keep saying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I'd say like this,
the moment when I stopped like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I had to like really pay attention </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to who I always hang out with was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause of this one convention I went to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> The thing was like three, four years ago, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I can't remember exactly
how many years it's been, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it was like my first proper,
creepy stalker experience. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Sounds like a YouTube title. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like that your
story animation title. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, exactly so-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why are you wasting
us at the podcast, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Make your story a little bit later. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just feel like I
can draw my life, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But yeah, I was at this convention </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and there was like a communal area. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And, you know, at conventions, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what I like doing at conventions
is meeting random people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Meeting fans, talking with people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the thing is I've met, like
a lot of my closest friends, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've met through conventions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like our friend group in England, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 90% of those people were
people who I met at conventions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and were fans of me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that's why I had always tried to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, be as open as
possible no matter who it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like this was
the point when I realized, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, maybe my reach is a
little bigger than, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what I'm comfortable with." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I was with, you know, hanging out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with just this random group of people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was me and Sydney. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we were, you know, we
were having a great time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> we were just chatting shit
about anime and other shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like, in this middle
of this convention hall </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then it was like, you know,
it was time to just disperse </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and go in own ways.
- [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So me and Sydney start
walking back to our hotel rooms </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everyone else goes their own ways. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then this one kid starts, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> starts walking the same
direction with with us, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it the same guy from Akihabara? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no, it's not the same guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Compared to the guy in Akihabara, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the guy in Akihabara was like
a fucking saint, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yikes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - So this kid follows us and I asked, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and so I was trying to
be polite to be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, well, you know,
where are you staying?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And he was like, "Oh, I'm staying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> in the same hotel as you guys." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Now, keep in mind, you
know, I talked with the kid, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, quite a bit, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> when we're hanging out in a group. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - All right, so you
thought it was plausible </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that you told him your hotel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, it's, and I was,
you know, I wasn't wasted, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> but I was, you know, I
had a few drinks in me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I was feeling friendly,
so I was like, whatever, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just making casual chitchat
and he seemed normal enough. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know, he didn't seem like
a creep or anything like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so, we go back, we go to our hotel, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and then we get in the lift </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then he goes in the lift with us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we're like, "Oh, what floor are you?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, no, sorry, so we get we
get in lift and I hit my floor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I ask, "Oh, what floor are you?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he goes, "Oh, it's
the same floor as you." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And at this point nothing
clicked in my mind, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I was so innocent
at that point I was-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, there's lots of
rooms in that floor too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know, and both me
and Sydney were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, what a coincidence, you
know, we're on the same floor." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, that's a huge
coincidence and at this point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, no, I just
wanna go to my bed and sleep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm way too tired, so I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, cool, that's a huge coincidence." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we go up to the floor and then, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I go in first, I go to my room first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Sydney is just right bit behind me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm tired as fuck, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just wanna get into my hotel room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so, I go to the door
put my key in, I turn around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the kid is still
there and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What are you doing?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he straight up tells me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, no, I just completely lied, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just wanted to see
where you were saying." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "What the
fuck do I say to this?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then apparently, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I wasn't looking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before I had asked that he tried to go in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for a kiss with Sydney
and Sydney told me this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after we'd got in our hotel room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then after he said,
"Oh, no, I'm lying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just wanted to see where
you guys are living, bye." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he just fucks off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, what, do I call security. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I didn't even get his name, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so I didn't know who this kid was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just this random kid that I'd met, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he knew who I was obviously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was this random kid who I had met </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like on the convention floor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And so, this was the
first time I'd had like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a fucking freak out of
my hotel room to be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Yo, shit, we gotta call security." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Would it be like, "Can
we get like Chris Jones </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to stand outside this door,
do we change hotel rooms, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what the fuck do we do?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And that was the exact
moment when I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, I gotta be fucking careful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about who I hang out with at conventions." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So if I'm a bit standoffish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I meet someone new at conventions, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> blame that guy, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's what the PTSD comes from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's where the PTSD comes from. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, shit, what the fuck, that's creepy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I had something kind of similar to that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, I've had multiple
experiences similar to that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> but I think the creepiest
one that I ever had was, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it wasn't even in a hotel
room, you know, I was staying, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was like the first time, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so I've been to Otakuthon in
Montreal a couple of times. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, everything is fucking
weird out there, God, damn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got nothing against Montreal, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Montreal is a beautiful city, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but all the weeb shit
happened to me there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was staying at my
friend's place at the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause he lived like five minutes
train from the convention, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so I'm like fuck it, I'll stay at his. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we were staying with like
a couple of other friends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And this is before the convention
had even started, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> But I was a guest at that convention, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so people around Montreal knew </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that I was gonna be at that convention. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it was like midnight, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like 12:00 a.m. and I
was just fucking around </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> with my friends and we
get a knock on the door </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's like, and I was like, "Okay." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I open the door and there's
just the box sitting there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like not even a package, like
not even mail, just a box. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "Is this a bomb? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is this?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I told my like the friend
who, you know, the place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Did you get a package?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, "No." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Did anyone here get a package?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like, "No." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's in the box? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then I flipped the box
over and it says to Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I was like, "Oh my!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I fucking like looked around was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "There's no one around." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I took the box in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why the
fuck I took the box in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I took the box and close the
door and I slowly opened it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it was a Tupperware container of, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know what poutine is? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Poutine it's this like dish in-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's cheese in chips. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's cheese in chips
basically with gravy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a French Canadian thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I fucking love cheese in chips gravy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Poutine is
fucking delicious, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But there was a Tupperware full of poutine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and on top of the Tupperware it said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm a huge fan of you Joey,
I made some poutine for you." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was it still hot? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was still hot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How did she know where you're staying? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's exactly what I wanna know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why I was shitting my pants. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, wait, wait was it good? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't eat it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck, I would eat that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - No.
- Dude, okay, one time-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've seen Higurashi
dude, I've seen the scenes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where you eat the fucking ohagi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's a giant
needle inside, all right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I wasn't gonna have that shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - All right, one time, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I got gifted like a whole as bento box, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like a legit like big ass bento box. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's sort of had curry in
it, like a little curry. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I wasn't gonna eat it,
but I was in the hotel room, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was like 12:00 a.m.
I was fucking starving. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I remember I had the
bento box in my room </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I take this curry and I
didn't have like a knife or fork </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so I'm like, I'm in a fucking hotel room, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I have like the ice
pick thing like knife. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was like a fork like two prongs, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> so I'm just fucking scooping up this curry </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was eating it and it
was fucking tasted so good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It was such a good curry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, no, I fucking remembered it like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I was like so fucking
ghetto eating that with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like my fucking ice pig. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I wouldn't do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just remembered though
with the poutine thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't eat it because I
was too fucking scared to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but my friend was like
fuck it I will eat it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it's still warm. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But then he ate it and the
first bite he took he was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> "Why is there a giant hair in this?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's none of that in the curry, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the curry was clean good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they could be two options
here either one she </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or I'm assuming it's a girl
she accidentally like drop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the hair in or she was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I'm gonna get Joey to
eat some of my hair." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - My DNA. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, my name is inside Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, oh, just thinking about it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> shit was just so fucking creepy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm gonna be an STO Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm gonna be at the top of his ranks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> when a part of me is inside his stomach. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, just a fair warning for anyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> who wants to like gift us
anything, don't gift us food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like especially if it's hand made. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Unless it's real bomb, then
I'll still eat it, but no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean, I'm
not gonna eat something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> unless it's like packaged. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm fine with food as long
as it just doesn't appear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in front of my hotel room </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause the weirdest thing I would say is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when people know where
you're staying in the hotel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and regardless of whether
you're a fucking famous YouTuber </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> or not that shits weird,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it was the
creepiest Uber Eats delivery. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wouldn't eat that
man, I was just playing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I just ate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I literally just eaten </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like stall bought poutine before hand. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Always the one for more man, always-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that shit fills you up by the way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know, but--
- Plus it's fucking delicious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I haven't had anything like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been lucky enough to like not be-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm surprised you haven't had this-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - If anyone was that must
have creepy fans its you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Come on, guys step up, come
on I need more story up here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, sort of, I guess kind of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, one time in this convention, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so typically, they don't
put you on the first floor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they're not supposed
to because obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's where all the elevators are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everyone's, all the people are there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so typically they're actually
put guests on the first floor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and they normally have a floor </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's specifically for staff and guests, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like separate so
that no attendee should be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> on the same floor as a guest or a staff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what they're supposed to do, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but sometimes the Cons don't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm in one of them, I
was on the first floor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was kind of annoyed
'cause I was literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about 15 meters from the elevator. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So everyone knows where I come from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A great placement. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right next to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I come from where do I go? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly, call Nigel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So it was just like asking someone to see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> where I was staying, I'm sure
most people saw where I was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Luckily, I took advantage of that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but at about like 2:00 a.m. one night, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like basically naked,
but I really wanted ice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and the ice thing was
right next to the, my room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And thought mission impossible, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's 10 seconds in and out no problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm in my boxes only, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm still gonna fucking
do it, like I don't care. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> It's only me, who cares? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like building myself up confidence. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could just put a T-shirt on,
no, I'm building myself up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I opened the door and there's
just two kills sitting there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> opposite my door. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, what the fuck, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been like, fucking
SpongeBob has been on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like full volume in my room
dude like what do you-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you're naked? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like basically naked,
I'm like, go to the ice machine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and I get it and I go
back in and I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as I'm closing my door I'm
like, "What are you doing?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like nothing, I'm like, "All right then." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did they know you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't even ask. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I had to close the door and
they said nothing, I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "All right, I'm going back to bed." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Meanwhile, they were like huge fans </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and they just creaming themselves. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe, maybe, I mean, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> based on watching one
of my cosplay videos, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so it's not really like a big deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I saw Sidova's nipples. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> He came out watching sponge bob-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're not on YouTube,
so it's not a big deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For some reason he came out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> of his hotel room butt
naked watching SpongeBob. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I didn't even wanna ask
why he was doing that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just wanted ice, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And one time I was on
like the seventh floor </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in like Minneapolis and I went to my room, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no one else on this floor, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> there's just this like
seven foot white dude, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just sitting in front of my door. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just sitting in front of
it, literally blocking it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, "Hey, can I get into my room?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> He's like, "Oh, yeah, sure." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I've had that plenty of times too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Like people, random people
sitting in front of my door. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's almost always people
who don't know who I am. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because like, "Why are you here?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it's like at conventions, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hotel rooms just become a fucking zoo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was just so confused. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, Okay, like,
he was literally like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> not even like next to it,
like in front of my door. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I like kind of like, I'm
like, "Hey, can you move? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna get into my room." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like why do these like
attendees think that are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like hotel hallways are the
same as convention hallways, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can't just sit in my hallway. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I didn't say
anything 'cause I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna hope that when I
leave this room in 20 minutes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> after I've had my shower,
he will not be there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Luckily he wasn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I was like, that was just so weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've never had like the
getting of letters slipped </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> under your hotel door
and stories like that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or people still get back to your room? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, they always like give
it to my face, which is like-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's so much nice, I wish I had that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had someone who's like this is for you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was an envelope. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought like that's nice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe he could be a little cunt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I noticed like it's a little light. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And the helper next to me is
like, oh, you should open it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, I was gonna leave it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> something like leave it till I get back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause people are still
coming and I opened it up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's a hotel key card. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And on the envelope, they've
written their room number. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like damn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Damn son. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then the handler-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you go? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe straight, any dude
watching this is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it's free invitation. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a fairy tale
cosplays, so I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "No, thank you." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm kidding, I just thought this is not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the kind of Chris Hansen
trap I need to walk into. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like this is, "No, no, no, no." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This is like a James Bond
plot, but no, thank you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> And like the handler next
to me was like, "Damn." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - He was like, "Can I have that?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I was like, "Do you want it?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I asked him to give it back to the hotel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, people did give me
like numbers or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just flattering,
I'm like, "Thank you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Babe, you think I'm the one
texting, you are the one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> God, get outta, get outta here you." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like it, I don't know, it's nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I think the
nicest gift I've ever got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> from a fan was, it was at AX where-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - A lot of my enemies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - So someone had given me
also like handwritten letter, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> but with the letter was
like, it came in a box </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and in the box was like
a lot of origami cranes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that she was like fold it herself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "Did you
do this all by hand?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she's like, "Yeah,
you know, I was just bored </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I just wanted to give you
something that was memorable." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was definitely
memorable because it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, I was like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, you're telling the
story of her right now, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly, I still
remember her to this day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I still have it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fucking, it was the
first time I felt like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe I'm doing some
good in this world man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm so happy, thank you so much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But yeah, it was just-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was talking about animated titties </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and I get this beautiful gifts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you seen like the vine or whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> where the guy is making
a sandwich with crisps. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's like, "You made this for me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Bro, you made this for me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I love you, bro." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> That's how I fell in
that exact moment, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you remember that like
really creepy statue I had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> at my house?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love this, I loved it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> A fan had made me the statue </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it was like a proper clay statue. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't think they were
like amazing in it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was so fucking sweet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was so cursed and
creepy at the same time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it was such, so I
just couldn't imagine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the amount of thought they put into this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I fucking loved it so
much so I kept it in my house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So whenever anybody came
to my house, they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What the fuck is that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is that?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Oh, it's a statue of me." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, "You, that's you?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "It's not the most flattering, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but a fan gave it to me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, "Oh, that's nice." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, blah, blah, blah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, probably because when
you say it's a statue of you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is like did you make that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - The thing was as well as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that it kinda looked really beat up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because it like went
through the mail as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and I had to like, I thought
this thing was so cool, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they done it that I spent
like an hour and a half </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> super gluing it all back together </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just so I could display it in my house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and creep everyone out
I guess by accident, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I thought like,
"Oh, this is so sweet." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And now that's in my parents
house creeping them out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Thank you that one fan who
sent me that statue of me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in like an owl pose. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, we appreciate that
shit so much honestly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - We don't do anything that amazing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> to be able to get gifts like that so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like being given anything
it just feels really weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you would, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to give something to us anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And not weird in a bad
way, just weird for us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we're just like, we
don't do anything special. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> We just fucking talk about-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fucking make videos. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Comment on anime titties and whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's very humbling 'cause I again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel like I make the
videos just for myself and, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know, just to pay the bills </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's kind of like the main reasons, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know what that like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I make the videos first
and foremost for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it's just like,
I constantly forget </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how much people enjoy them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's really just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, shit, these mean things to people?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Not that my videos are like
worth meaning anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't mean that, I'm not
considered at all to think that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but other people were
like, "Oh, you know-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - My videos are deep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, like you may say issues like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "You know, I'm doing this
'cause it keeps people happy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without me to pressure you to go up 10%." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm changing the world,
you might react that way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's like, you know, I get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Some people it's like that routine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I thought that if someone's video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> even though it's dumb is like,
you know, maybe help me out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I've just come to, I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> It's hard to explain.
- It's always nice, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's always humbling because
what we see on our side </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> is just a number.
- It's so, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - A number means nothing, but
when we go to a convention </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and we see a room full of people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's like putting of
like actual people and faces </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and interactions to
those numbers it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless you've experienced that
you can't really describe it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's very humbling and
it's very flattering </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and you don't quite
know what the right way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to react to it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> So we just hope that we
react in a way that one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't make you feel bad
and two, doesn't make us seem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like conceited ourselves in anime as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just want you if you know
me and you come up to me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> just have like, go away from
that interaction thing of, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> damn, always everything
I wanted them to be. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> That's all I want and it's so hard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because sometimes I'm like,
did I say the right thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> should I have squeezed them
a little harder with the hug, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> should I have shaken their hand longer? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like sometimes every
time after convention, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I wake up in a cold sweat to be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Man was I an asshole to that one person." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I was just trying to get food, like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like we gonna get canceled,
we gonna get canceled. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's also like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause some people they
always like want a little more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's hard 'cause you like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> especially if you're
going out for like dinner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with your anime friends, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, man, I really don't
want them to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Damn, Connor is an asshole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> he wouldn't let me eat with him." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's like, "Well, I mean-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, for some reason,
I don't give a shit about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the one hate comment or like the haters-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, you see on a YouTube comment, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the thoughts of this guy
trashing me to his friends, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just fucking keeps me up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that fucking keeps me up at night, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so real, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so real. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I could be totally in the
right and being fuck off, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but I can't do it because I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Man, this guy respect me so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I really don't wanna be mean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm trying to explain it so nicely, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but he's just not getting it sometimes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because, you know, there's
a little part of you where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> if the roles were reversed, you'd be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Man, I think I was a fucking asshole." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which, by the way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> shout out to that guy I met in Akihabara, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who I told the story about for
being a good sport about it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, it was an awkward interaction, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but thank you for being
good sport about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, I saw your
comments and everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, yeah, I mean-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, bottom line, we
appreciate every single person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that comes up to us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just that sometimes every
now and then there's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that one really weird person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just like, you know, social-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just be a norm, just be you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just be you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Understand that social norms
do exist in anime conventions-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Basically, you know, pretty
now, you're trash taster, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're my dude now, come on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just okay, I think
the best way to what is, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> treat us no differently how
you would just treat a stranger </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause, you know, it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how I would explain my past relationships </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where I've watched people,
you know, on YouTube </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that, you know, you do
feel like a connection with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because you feel like you do know them, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but you have to understand that
that's a one way connection. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You wouldn't go up to a
random stranger and be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Yo, bro I know everything
you've done, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I know your entire life
story, let's be friends." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know, there are
several steps for both ends </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when it comes to making friends </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> whether you know the person or not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And our perspective is, we don't know you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So as long as you just come
in with that perspective-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is the worst
question I hated the most, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "Can we be friends?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's the worst question. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Because is like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so loaded. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like how on earth do you
expect like me to answer that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, "Yo, we're best friends, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> here's my fucking phone number. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're going on vacation next week, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why don't you come join us?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - By the way, what's your name? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so--
- You don't make friends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> by asking someone, "Can we be friends?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, like, I feel
like asking that question, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you never win as the person
asking that question, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you're gonna get what you
want and you all you're doing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is making the situation
awkward for everyone involved. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I have to explain to you be
like, "So, I don't know you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I would like to, you know,
I'm happy to talk to you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and get to know you a little better. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I hate that talk too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because it makes you sound
like an asshole, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I don't wanna,
'cause it makes me feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like I'm like putting them below me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, you don't have
the right to be friends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't have enough subs to be like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, but it's so difficult </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because there's no way
of really explaining that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> without making it sound like
you're in the better position </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> with like, "Hey, no, no." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, the way I would think about it is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, like I said, "You
wouldn't ask a person that you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> whether they're famous or
not you've just met kinda, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, can we be friends?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - True, true, true.
- Like 90% of the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're gonna be like,
"I mean, I don't know you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you don't know me."
- Who are you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, like can we get
to know each other first-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, exactly.
- And then we can decide. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But not through asking that question. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - True. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Now I'm actually just curious, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like once conventions do
start to open up again, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I wonder how many people are
gonna come up to us being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Yo, Joey from Trash Tastes, right?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, Trash Taste as opposed to channel? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, as opposed to like the Anime Man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm genuinely curious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who knows man, who knows? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because I'm sure there's
like some Trash Taste viewers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> who don't watch like
our individual channels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, for sure, for sure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Or probably don't, never knew us </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> before Trash Taste, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm just curious like who's
gonna be the first person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like, "Yo, it's Joey,
Garnt, Connor from Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've gotta love that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's gotta be fucking cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just miss, I just miss all like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the mispronunciation of my username. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I have like a fucking list of
all the missed pronunciations </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of like everyone who's
tried to pronounce Gigguk. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude I get that too and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember I had one guy
at Anime Expo being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yo, are you Josh the Anime Man?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "What, it's not even close." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wasn't that that one
guy who like, who like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, in Singapore, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who was like, "Are you Gigguk?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Meanwhile, Garnt is
standing right next to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Ah, no,
that's Gigguk actually." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God!
- He was my fucking favorite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do you do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know, like,
oh, yeah, it's hilarious. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, either way we
fucking miss conventions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sure if you're a convention goer, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you probably miss convention. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We would go to any
conventions invite us please. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just invite us.
- And honestly-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sure we have some other
stories that we've forgotten </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> or something that we can tell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, let's be more in future, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause we'll just tell them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Also if you want us to go
to a convention with you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> when they eventually open
up, the best way to do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is to like email the convention yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and tell them you want to see us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that is by far the best
way to get us going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause the owners don't know who you want, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you have to actually tell them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't tell us, we can't
do shit just saying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, don't like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> we get so many like
emails and tweets coming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like, "Hey, can you come
to this conventions?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is like we- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We don't make that decision. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we don't make that decisions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - We get the invites from a convention, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so if there's enough interest
for your local convention-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like saying like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey, can you go to this
random person's wedding?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, "I didn't get the
invite dude, I can't go." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like bro you're playing
at this concert, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you're playing this gig. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, can you go to the gig? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, "No, I can't, no." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, so let your like,
you know, local convention </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or whatever know who you want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wanna go anywhere in the
world even after the virus. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, honestly, like conventions, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I fucking love conventions
because it gives me the-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And whatever travel, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and whatever conventions
wants to host the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in person Trash Taste--
- whoa! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Whoa, that's good, that
would be some spicy shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That would be some spicy shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's would be fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> In the meantime, though, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> look at these lovely patreons
who support the show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Damn, I love those patreons, man, damn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I found to love them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - These guys are very
normal at conventions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I bet they'd won't
stalk me, they won't-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - They won't block me, it's alright. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But if you'd like to be
