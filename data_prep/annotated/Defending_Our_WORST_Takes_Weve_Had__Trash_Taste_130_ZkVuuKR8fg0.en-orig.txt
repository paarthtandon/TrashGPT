<SPEAKER_02> soon right right guys how you guys been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what you been up to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was thinking about it I'm like that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a really [ __ ] good question so what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have I done this week other than just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> play Pokemon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been touching grass you've been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> touching some virtual games I've been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> touching some virtual five frames per </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> second grass yeah we all know we've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> already established you don't see frames </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't you can't sell this between </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> six times that's why that's why you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> them that's why people like people are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh the switch has performance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> issues and this game runs like [ __ ] I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what are you talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly the same oh my God the fact that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen clips and so much [ __ ] I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like how could you not tell the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> difference this is okay so yeah I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was like there was rumors going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> around being like Oh if you bought the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> physical copy then it runs a million </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> times more worse and it's a million </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> times more glitchy than the digital </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> version yeah so maybe that's why because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like mine was like I had a couple of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like because you know yeah I mean I had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a couple of like frame drops and [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that and a lot of parts that were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> struggling to load </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um but I want having like a huge crashes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like some people would so maybe there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some truth to that matter but um sorry I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> think they sold 10 million copies in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> first three days yeah are you serious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's very successful it was a very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> highly anticipated series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> um yeah I mean I I just finished it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yesterday actually I know nothing about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this because I don't really follow the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gaming sphere especially Pokemon yeah so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is this like a new Mainline game or is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this it's the ninth generation okay and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is it like 2D 3D 3D </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um so so it's it's kind of like Legends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Arceus if you saw anything about that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> except this time it's actually open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> world unlike Arceus that was is an open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> zone game and I'm like oh is that a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Sonic game it's like areas that are open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but then I think that's been a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> other games and we need a term for it we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> were just like that's level yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like uh it's like Mario Odyssey right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's like you it's like once you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> open up the world then you have free </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> range on the entire world and you can do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whatever the [ __ ] you want in that area </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but in in order to open up the next Zone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to progress in the story right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right whereas this one is the actual </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> first proper open world where like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> entire map is actually open for you okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like the only like roadblocks of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like traversing through the world is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know you got to get your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Pokemon like surf so you can go on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ocean or something like that but other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than that like places you can walk it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> fully open okay okay as somebody who's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> played a [ __ ] ton of Pokemon and I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really feel that interested to play this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> new one is there any reason I should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> play the new one is there anything new </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> not for reasons you will care about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because let me guess story yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> story and music are probably the best in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> any Pokemon game two things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> let me tell you about the story and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> music it's it's incredible because the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gameplay changed at all okay so the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> okay so the gameplay Loop okay did you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> play Arceus at all I did okay did you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like the gameplay Looper bosses yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay then it's it's essentially the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the Pokemon are running around uh in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the open World um of course it's like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would say Arceus was miraculously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> somehow Less buggier in that sense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there are moments where like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Pokemon will suddenly appear and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you approach him and then they just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> straight up disappear and so there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like a great game I mean it's great to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stream because it's hilarious yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because the game is just so glitchy and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> broken but like other than that like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gameplay loop I would say is really good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I I don't know this is like the big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> argument when it comes to like every new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> generation of Pokemon being like have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Pokemon designs gotten lazier or have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they gotten better that's like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never-ending [ __ ] argument right like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more like you know from the brief like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> pictures I saw of the new Pokemon they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> look more like Digimon than Pokemon a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of people have said that they they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> very much look like whoa okay I will say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> though I think this is probably the one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> generation where I think all three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> starter Pokemon are just as popular as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one another okay because like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how like in like gen 1 for example it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like clearly like you know uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> charmanderal Squirtle were like the top </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> two contenders it's like Bulbasaur I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sleep yeah you know and it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's oh there was always one starter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like I sleep or there was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clear winner I feel in this generation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen like almost an equal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dispersion of all three starters because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think like all three of the designs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> are really solid and like just again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the gameplay kind of really cult </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not doesn't really matter really like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what kind of study you pick at the end </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the day because it is an opal world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you can go in any direction I want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> them to make starters that aren't water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fire or grass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell her they should do that just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is it because of the is it because of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the the three colors that are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> aesthetically pleasing is that why yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and why do we stick to it well I guess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's also because of the OG like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> triangle right yeah like you know what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is stronger than the other you know kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of thing I guess so I feel like it could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> be more exciting to yeah I agree to mix </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> up you know just I agree because they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> all get two types anyway now yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like all right well why don't we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just do all right well if it gets fire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> later on or some [ __ ] yeah but I'm sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can like Traverse through the game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> without using your starter at all yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean you normally can Pokemon's easy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enough now where you have to have one IQ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to yeah like it's it's I it's really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> hard to [ __ ] up it is it is I mean is it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is it worth getting back into Pokemon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> nowadays because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where did you stop I I stopped uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Pokemon Ruby that's which yes I know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> wrong I know I mean you did you did it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you did play Peak Pokemon in my yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah because I I played red and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> blue I played gold and silver then I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> played Ruby and I was like okay I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm done and that's fair I think and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's been like how many decades now yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> formula hasn't changed and it's gotten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> easier yeah so I think the reason why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Pokemon has had a lot of longevity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amongst older people is that you add the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nuzlocker the challenges yeah yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> add a spin to it that makes it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> interesting for yourself yeah because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the way I see the Pokemon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> franchise in my mind it's it's kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like the same way you know isekai is for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> anime where it's it's it's iterations of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the same idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> well okay if you like it I don't know I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did more by that they're both pretty I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was gonna say something like it's a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like Game of Thrones where it's like if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like if you're like six seven </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no in the sense of like how the fan base </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Works where it's like okay if you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> already six or seven seasons in you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> might as well just [ __ ] finish the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> rest at that point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what are you talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> are you talking about Joe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> um what I mean is if you're it's it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot like any long-form TV series where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's got multiple Series right or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> multiple Seasons we're like okay you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enjoyed the first couple of ones okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe the third or fourth one slightly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> stunned to go downhill but you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> already committed at this point you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> might as well I don't agree with this I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like I haven't enjoyed every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Pokemon game some of the Pokemon games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in in my opinion have been quite [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like sun and moon was we're pretty mid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in my opinion sword and shield was dog </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] it wasn't dog [ __ ] it wasn't I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> hated that it was oh I hated it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> um X and Y was like yeah it was okay as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well um I can't remember a single </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Pokemon from sword and shield except for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like the the two characters the sword on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the shield yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if you if you tell me to name any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Pokemon from that game I'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm the same though with like X and Y or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like sun and moon I'm like after that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> point for me it's like after Gen 4 and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the recent one that I just played I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> don't really remember it I didn't play X </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Y or son of shields that's why I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> don't but I I don't I played the whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game I don't remember any but also I I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wouldn't say it's like the Game of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Thrones analogy I'd say it's more like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well it's it's independent Series right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so there's no ongoing no it's okay okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is not the same isakai Series right it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not like we've done this is one guy in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the same world as a smartphone and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a different story with a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> different uh the cast of characters oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's like your take it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> iterations of the same kind of formula </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's kind of like it's like no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because that would be like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is there like an ongoing story or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something no but but like Doctor Who is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> also in in the sense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but Pokemon also has callbacks as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like there are a lot of callbacks in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> newer Generations where you wouldn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really really understand it I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially in terms of like the war </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> which is in the same with Doctor Who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right where it's like you could just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like go straight into season 10 which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone who's the best doctor who have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you I've watched five to eleven who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't well it kind of does separate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but then they do have they do have call </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> backs and mentions yeah I'm nervous I've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> never seen the first couple of messes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like in terms of the Doctor Who I've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> never seen like the first four seasons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to talk to her no no but I still enjoyed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all the seasons I watched because they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't heavily depend on the callbacks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's it's kind of like if you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to fully hunt it's like a trash taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> episode you know you don't have to watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the one before yeah but it's the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing no I mean I mean Doctor Who has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always had like one goal which is you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know for for the dogs which you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> find Gallifrey you know find find other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time Lords and stuff like that that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's always been like one Central </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goal and then you've had like story arcs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that have like come and gone with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different characters and everything but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the core idea of the show as always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> remains kind of the same Pokemon's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly the same what's the end goal to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> be the very best there are a couple of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Side characters that have their own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> storylines before but at the end of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> day you're there to [ __ ] beat the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Elite Four and be the champion yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no need to play any Pokemon game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> prior time yeah yeah I get that even I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think like black and white black and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> white two I don't even think their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stories aren't necessarily like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what I was trying to say is I got like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the reason I stopped playing was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I got kind of tired of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> formula and then I was just like is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there anything what I was trying to ask </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is that is there anything new to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> bring me back yes so aside from Arceus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which actually looks interesting yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> well Arceus is not even a Mainline game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like in terms of violent Scarlet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the new one yeah what what I thought was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really really cool was like the the open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> wall thing is of course one thing but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> also now there are three branching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> storylines that you can choose to do oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> okay and it's pretty cool and it's and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's like one of the story lines is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the BTA gyms beat the Elite Four become </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the champion the standard one yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and then there are two other storylines </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can do that follow two separate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> characters and then well I mean at the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> end of the day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in order to get to like the final end </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> end you have to do all three story lines </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anyway but you can do this storyline in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> any order you want that's cool so you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> can choose to be like I'm just gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] Elite Four and become a champion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then start this next one or what I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did was I did all three simultaneously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay and so it's like okay so I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> defeated uh the fifth gym uh you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> instead of going to the sixth gym I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just gonna go do this next part of this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> story right and so it's kind of like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pick you're an adventure type of style </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that works really well in like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> open world setting yeah so now it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> becomes like this fresh new thing that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can do it's not just like uh I need </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to make the best team and you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> become the best people criticizing the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the visuals of the game that they don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> look as good as up to par as other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Nintendo switch games okay so one thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I I don't know if this is a hot take but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I personally don't have a problem with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the way that the game looks because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean if you think about it that just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of how it works in the style of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Pokemon right like I can't imagine a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Pokemon game that has the graphics of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like a breath of the Wild Well I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's that I think they're just saying I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think a lot of criticism was was levied </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> at them because of like you know the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sceneries look really [ __ ] boring oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah they do I've seen a lot of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> screenshots of the game like wow this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this looks so visually boring it is yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> all the backgrounds and all the textures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> look really bad but I think as well uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know unlike say like because you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know the one game a lot of people use to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> compare his breath of the wild right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like Oh breath of the wild had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like so much [ __ ] going on and you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the environment was actually like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interactive and really cool but like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> whole point of breath of the wild is to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interact with your surroundings whereas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the Pokemon games it's not to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interact with the surroundings it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> interact with the Pokemon but I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> understand that I I would be like wow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this Pokemon in this natural habitat on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this one one by one PNG texture like I'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> be like well you know yeah no could they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> have done better absolutely yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like so they're getting they're getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> closer to like indie horror devs really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like we're just like we're just we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just making one big texture game Frank </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is doing this really cool thing where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're bringing back the PS2 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> one thing that odds that has always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> confused me about I guess like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> success of Pokemon like Mainline Pokemon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> games right is that would you say that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there has been a Pokemon game within </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the last few years that you would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say is like an absolute must play kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like the kind of like killer app that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd see like breath of the wild or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I like I've really really highly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> acclaimed game because really a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> people's favorite game is black and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> white too A lot of people love that one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but again but the Nintendo DS era is all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean they're very my new changes each </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> one and improvements also also I think a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of Pokemon fans favorite to black </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and white twos because it has one of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> best stories yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but if you don't give a [ __ ] about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the story Pokemon games which a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Pokemon players don't then it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's there's not really there's no game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to play I think it's Pokemon is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just a juggernaut of advertising yeah oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah and also it's easy like you as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> a parent you don't have to think about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> buying your Pokemon yeah as you as the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> parent know what Pokemon is it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Mario you don't have to there isn't like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a must play Mario game there are some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] classes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are you saying that through Nostalgia </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> goggles or is that you saying that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> through like Odyssey Still Remains as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like one of the best switch games and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like what like I I think it was like my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> game of the year like the year was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> released it was like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> incredible games they looked like Zelda </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> completely revolutionized the gaming uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the open world the open world genre </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after it got released so there have been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like there have been like big IPS that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have that have had killer apps but for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> me it always confused me up about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Pokemon is that it sells like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hot cakes it's it it breaks every kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of record imaginable and then I look at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the game reviews and then every every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time a new game comes out it's like yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's all right it's good it's because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's because I feel Pokemon generally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> are appealing to two types of player </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bases the children and the old school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Pokemon fans right right they're not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to get like this new adult fan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> base the who has never played Pokemon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before because they know there's no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Pokemon game that they can make that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> will be like like a 20 year old you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kid yeah who's never played a Pokemon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> game would be like yeah you know what I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> should give that game a go you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they're not going to do that it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> water everyone drinks water whereas the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wild is like the most Exquisite wine oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] I gotta be 21. I gotta have some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> money oh man I gotta be in wine like if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the best thing ever if you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that that you know you want to get into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it but Pokemon is so so basic Fiji Water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> anyone can drink it anyone even drinks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that anyone likes it yeah everyone's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> good everyone's gonna drink it but no </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> a bottle of Fiji Water you know they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just gonna be like yeah it quench my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> thirst yeah I'm satisfied I I yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know personally I'm just like kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of over Pokemon I'm like I kind of enjoy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it when there's a Nuzlocke or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fun to do no and I and that's the thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I totally get that which is why I always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> find it frustrating when these [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Pokemon fans are like no no I swear this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is the new this is the generation that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone has to play I'm like no they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't because at the end of the day it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a [ __ ] children's game they want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> say that I thought Pokemon fans hate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> everything they do oh okay but Pokemon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fans are the type of [ __ ] who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> will be like you know first week of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> violent scholar coming up being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this game looks like [ __ ] and then a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> week later they'll be like all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll give it a go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's like I'll complain about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> everything yeah it's funny you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> talking about this because I've just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> been I just finished drinking the finest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> wine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the the finest top tier wine because I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think I might have breath of all the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> blind yeah yeah I mean I think I might </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have found like a game that's come into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like my new top 10 games of all time uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because I just finished playing God of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> War the new God of War oh and that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's it's like incredible yeah every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> every sense of the words and I'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's I I finished it like two days ago </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's been a while since I've just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> finished a video game I'm like I don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know what to do with my life now what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like I just feel an emptiness and I just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looked at like other because after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> playing God of War I was just like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wanted to play some other games and I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just looked through my game list and I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like none of this is doing anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for me I don't know one of this excites </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> me no no this excites me anymore how how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> on Earth do I become a gamer again you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> have the post not Clarity of games yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I don't know what to do anymore I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know what you should do play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Scotland </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no that would that would just make it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> worse because then I would just start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> playing it I'm like this is this isn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> good no dude because you you'll you'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> understand the story is really good how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> long is it and the music's really good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as long as the PS5 been out for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> uh years two years two years two years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because it came out really I thought it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was like two and a half yeah I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like two and a half years yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just realized I'm like I I have I've had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a PS5 and I've only gamed on it like one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time bro God of War I I think you would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really like it do I need to play the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> previous God yes you do see that's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> problem is that I gotta go play the old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> one I'm like oh have you played any of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them it's it's all like the second one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um you have you played stuff like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> last of us or Uncharted or stuff like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that because it's kind of like in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same kind of vein where it is like kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like a cinematic experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it looks really good yeah just I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know if I have the heart of me to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go and play the old one just to play the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> new one well actually like the old one I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think the old one is [ __ ] fan is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> fantastic game by itself as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and by itself it's still a fantastic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> game you're not losing anything by </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> playing the old one yeah the only thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um like the old one Builds on these like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gameplay ideas and stuff like that and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one of the biggest criticisms of the old </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one was there was just not enough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> variation in one like the boss battles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and two enemy types </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and like and like kind of like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gameplay itself and that's just because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the first one they were completely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rebuilding the franchise </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so I actually really liked you know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> new like when they introduced like new </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gameplay it's a bit slower a bit heavier </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's the perfect introduction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to this new game which takes all of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ideas from this old game and then Builds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on everything basically so so when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> playing the old one you'll get like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> freshness of like oh this feels good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this feels good and then just as it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about to get boring then then you finish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the game and then you can go to the new </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one where all these new ideas start </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> getting iterated and added on and right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I think it's like the perfect </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Journey as well from playing like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> first one to the second one because one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the story is amazing in both games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and I'm surprised that they I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> surprised they only did two games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I expected it to be a Trilogy of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sorts but no it's it's after two games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the entire story arc is ended now so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the entire story arc of uh of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Nordic gods or this this Nordic Arc per </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> se and yeah honestly one of the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> video game stories I've uh ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> experienced damn now you got to finish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Alden ring so you can find out what game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of the year is this year yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay here's the thing I even and even if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I finish Elder ring I don't think it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could beat God of War for me because you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know you know me story story important </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> aspects of course there's another story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Elden </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> tell me the story you know them again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a ring of some kind I guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because okay here's here here's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing uh what playing God of War made me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> realize and uh this is do you want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> play a movie huh is you wanna no no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no no no no no no I would play depth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> training but that's actually the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> opposite actually the opposite it made </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me realize okay I actually do really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> care about gameplay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but but like okay so let me let me break </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this down right so there are some very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much Elden ring Souls like bosses in God </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of War that are really really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> challenging </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um but you really have to it's like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> side quest right so it's not the main </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> quest story it's optional boss so the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> hardest bosses in the game have nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do with the mainline story right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's good and and basically God of War </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> was one of those games that I enjoyed so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> much that I wanted to complete like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 100 in the game which is only the second </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> game in my life that I've ever 100 which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just shows how much what's your first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> one huh my first one is uh tails game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> tails of symphony what the [ __ ] wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've never before that you'd never 100 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of the game no I know what okay I'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tell you I'll I'll get to that I'll get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to that because what happened is I would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> complete the story and I'm like okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> done well I don't need to play this game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anymore right you never thought wow this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game is fun I wonder if I should just do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the rest of the game no no that's that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my point right because what I really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> liked about God of War is that you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do like one one thing side quest side </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> quests are [ __ ] incredible they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have as much impact into your emotions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and the story I feel like as much as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Mainline quest lines right that's that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one thing that makes a really really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> special game that's why everyone loves </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The Witcher 3 and stuff like that God of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> War has the same kind of philosophy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you can do the mainline Quest but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the side quests are in my opinion just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as high quality as the mainline quests </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I wanted to do every single aspect of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and so by being really really high </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> quality it's a it tricked me into doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the optional bosses right because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> otherwise I would have no interest in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doing these optional hard bosses uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I'm like I'm here for the story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but because the quality of the story was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> so high it tricked me into wanting to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the optional bosses and in that process </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I really really [ __ ] enjoyed my time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just challenging myself and just you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know doing like the whole Souls kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> repeat Die Repeat die and after about 20 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] tries you finally to get that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Boston like that feels [ __ ] great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I know I wouldn't have done that if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there wasn't a storyline to play through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right it's it's like I with gameplay in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> order for me like you wanted to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> immersed in rather than just tacked on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> at the end I need I need to know that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a payoff at the end right other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> than just an intrinsic well isn't the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> payoff the [ __ ] away so you just can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like you play a game and you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the only point of playing the game is so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you know the ending's good yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know that so I know that I get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rewarded with something most of the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> isn't the payoff the fact that you 100 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> completed the game you like fighting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> games right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean I mean I I do not like play a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> game you're like oh this mechanics are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> fun I want to keep playing this you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you're like I've got I hope this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> paying off soon I I'll find out I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fighting games are different because I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think competitive games are different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you get the satisfaction of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beating a human opponent right whereas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whereas in you know Souls like games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've really really enjoyed the bosses </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's even though I feel really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really satisfied there's just there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always this part missing where I want I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to know I'm working towards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something I want to know I'm working </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> towards a storyline or you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> self-improvement not a something you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> working towards is that not valuable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's why that's why I could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> never really get into competitive games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um well I mean like for like if I when I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> played like Alden ring I'm like oh I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really enjoyed the aspect of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understanding the game mechanics and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting better at doing it yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> enjoyed that I enjoyed getting better at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it so you necessarily care about what I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> was getting I enjoyed that as well but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not the core reason I would ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> play a game okay because I that I I can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> appreciate it but it's kind of it's kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> of like you need you need to trick me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> into okay getting me to care about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you're gonna just get better at any kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of thing that allows me better like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> would be something else there which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why which is why I'm really I'm really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> curious to see how you how you react to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God of War right because I think God of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> War is like I've never seen such a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> perfect marriage of gameplay and story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that blends so seamlessly God of War got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me to care about gameplay because it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so seamlessly Blended in with the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> combats </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it Blended so seamlessly in with the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> story that it actually got me to care </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> about the gameplay so there's a chance </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that Conor might actually care about the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> story I'm one I'm wondering if he could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do the impossible and get Connor to care </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about the story because it got me to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> care about the gameplay it got me to 100 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the game I [ __ ] love the gameplay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> love the mechanics it got me to learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's it's one of those gameplay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mechanics that's easy to pick up but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really really hard to master when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get to like some of the really tougher </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> optional bosses and stuff like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and it got me to really care about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that which I would never usually spend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this many hours like learning learning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the mechanics of the gameplay um but I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did it because the story is amazing and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted to grind through the story and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted to experience as much of this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> world and as much of these characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um as I could that um Santa Monica </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Studio have written and I've like built </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up in this world I wanted to experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just spend more time with them and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why I wanted to grind through the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gameplay was because it was just such a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pleasure to spend time in this world and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the story I'm wondering if it could get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you to care about the story in the world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> building </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I heard a story very complicated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> um first one is very simple and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> second one I heard was very like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> complicated it's I I'm used to jrpg </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> storylines this is like a simple app </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> storyline to be like oh what do you mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you didn't read the full Wikipedia page </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> before starting this Arc and it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what the [ __ ] is wrong with you I'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna go out and Google [ __ ] yeah just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> let me play the game like if I got I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> want to watch Connor play 13 cents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the game requires you to like study </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> outside of the game or read [ __ ] outside </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of the game then I think it's failed as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a game oh no like a story it's it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in fact I've way preferred the second </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game because the story had the story was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a bit more complicated there were a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> more aspects Connor you forget God's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fate fan yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not even it's not even complicated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think it's it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just think I'm just thinking because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like the first the first game was about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as simple as you can get okay let me let </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me tell you the story of the first game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay so so Kratos is a dad in this one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he has a wife his wife dies and his wife </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> says please spread my ashes on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> highest peak on the Realms and the first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> game is them going to the highest realm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been spreading her ashes and that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the game that's right that's how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I like that yeah that's that's easy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> easy second game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um it's about time travel comes in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> multiple Dimensions so there's Kratos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> blue yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Super Saiyan Kratos yeah the second game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is more about well they don't want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Kratos doesn't want to go to war because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> he's even though he's the God of War he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't really want to go to war and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then inevitably they find uh he ends up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to war yeah that's a very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> simplified version of the events but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's basically what happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they needed to find a reason for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> conflict to happen and that's why I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think the second game is a bit more a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bit more like has more moving Parts but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> at the end of the day it's compared to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like some other movies or some other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stories I mean I I think the [ __ ] MCU </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is more complicated than game uh than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the God of War so it's it's not a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> complicated the MCU is not complicated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out of design it's complicated because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're trying to milk it and then yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's getting out of hand yeah and also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's [ __ ] yeah like if you can follow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] like Game of Thrones or most I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most TV shows God of War is not that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> complicated at all he can be if you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go into like the lawn like the World </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> building and everything like that but in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> terms like the the core story it's it's </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> rest until I've continued watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything all right I mean it reminds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me of like early Game of Thrones We're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not gonna bring up this like can of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> worms again right because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you didn't like early game you didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> actually like good television that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right you want [ __ ] it's it's it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> not that I don't okay I'm I'm gonna I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna bring this back up because I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember I remember when Charles I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember when Charlie was talking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember when he filmed the Charlie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> episode he was like yeah I think like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> think like anime fans are pretty chill I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think like film and TV fans are the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most toxic I was like ah I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Charlie and then the [ __ ] episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> came out your take was so colossally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] that I think everyone across the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> board I don't even believe it I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even people have never watched Game of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Thrones late I don't it's probably not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I I look back at it I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I still I still agree with that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> take because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's because I didn't even okay here's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the here's the thing that confuses me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right here's the thing that confused me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't even say that I I didn't even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say that I thought the first like half </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Game of Thrones was better I just said I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> preferred like the latter half of Game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of Thrones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a big [ __ ] diff okay okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here's the thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here's the thing okay go on explain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yourself I I will explain I will explain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> myself okay I will explain myself I will </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay you're wrong okay so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh I I think I mentioned this briefly in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a recent video I did but to me I value </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff more like even if it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> perfectly executed versus something that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> might be highly claimed highly like very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very well executed that doesn't appeal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to me the reason the reason the latter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> half of the Game of Thrones appealed to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me more than the early seasons of Game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of Thrones is in the early season Game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of Thrones great writing great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> television okay but a lot of the stories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in Game of Thrones it was it wasn't like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> five stories that are in Connected there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were like five separate stories so you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had the stories going with he had the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> story with King's Landing the story with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Daenerys the story up in the wall </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're all really interesting stories </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they were all like their own kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> individual stories in that sense and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what really interests me and what I love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seeing in what I love what I value and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what I love seeing is different elements </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of like colliding in together so I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the thing I was waiting for in Game of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Thrones was to see these separate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> entities these separate elements yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> start colliding in together right and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> then I still really really appreciated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first four seasons of Game of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Thrones but when I've really really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> start to get interested was you know uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when Tyrion you know got shipped off to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Daenerys and I was like oh okay we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seeing one character interact with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> another character and then and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> elements Stark lines together and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> found that interesting and then you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I'm not gonna say season eight was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] even close to me it was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay when I say I prefer the latter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Seasons everything but season eight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> season eight was [ __ ] yeah but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> season six and season seven I would say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they were they were a bit messy they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weren't well executed but they had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> elements in them that I was waiting to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see for Game of Thrones this entire time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just I I you know I can say that I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think the first four seasons were better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> written but I can also say that even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> though the latter seasons were more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> metally executed had worse writing I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still I still see them as very very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> entertaining television I still see them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I I think the reason people clown on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their late season so far so much is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the first four seasons were so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] good right yeah I mean so I'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> explain this without spoiling anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and without you know going into too much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> detail </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um so the the you mentioned that like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're all individual stories about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because the way it works Jerry is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Game of Thrones will like be like here's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> here's this scene where it's happening </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at this location right and then another </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> scene in this location across the other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> side of the country yeah and so it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like God said it was building up to that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stuff was kind of gradually they were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of intertwining yeah and the first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three or four seasons there's stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happening and it tended to be quite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> insular but there would be stuff that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happened quite a lot that would have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Rippling effects and I think the reason </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why people like Game of Thrones so much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> was that if any other Rider had had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> written it it you know they it would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that when something happened in Game of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Thrones it was very like Slow Burn and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minute how it would Ripple but but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything was into consideration if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> somebody did or said something it would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have such a like really subtle effect or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every single like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah there was every single interaction </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was so carefully considered yeah and I I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> what really pissed off a lot of fans is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that one after the like season four it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of went to like okay these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> characters just fundamentally just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> changed like they just weren't writing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them the same as they were in the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> four seasons they weren't as intelligent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they started becoming more dumbed down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and also like travel became really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really fast as well so before in in Game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of Thrones I was traveling it would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> genuinely take like maybe a season for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone to travel right yeah or maybe a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> few episodes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and even then that might have been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> too fast right like yeah I it was it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all very subtle and very very realistic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was meant to be like a serious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> political drama where if you said </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something and pissed off the wrong </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> person maybe in a season no two when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they when they go to somewhere else it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> might have a ramification right yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every single thing was taken into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> consideration all the counter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> interactions were so perfect and then in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> season five six seven eight it started </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> getting dumber and dumber and dumber and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you mentioned like like there's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> character called Tyrion who was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> typically quite smart and he just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> becomes a [ __ ] stupid idiot in like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the past in the past like three seasons </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end he just becomes dumb and and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is com the complete different character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to what he was written as originally so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people were pissed off because all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> characters got stupider and and none of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the like the ramifications were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happening it was just kind of like duh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> big fight happened now and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> characters would suddenly have a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more plot armor than before and some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the characters shooting down to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lowest common denominator yeah because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the one of the things that Game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of Thrones did really well if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> haven't seen it is that when a character </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would be in a fight they had written it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> so well that you genuinely didn't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who was gonna live and die yeah like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there was the plot armor was never </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> transparent I was never like apparent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sorry and you never felt like someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> could 100 live just because they were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this character yeah because the first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> season sets it up that hey you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> characters are gonna die right away like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> characters that you thought were the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> main person or characters you thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were very important to the story will </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> die yeah and towards the end it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is the main character they will not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> die yeah and no matter what situation we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> put them in you can be pretty sure that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then there's not going to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> consequences and I think so it became </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> less like a a very very thought out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> written TV show and kind of went to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> triple A Hollywood movie where we know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the main guy wins at the end yeah and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> think that was the problem like it went </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> down to like a regular formula that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's yeah because even the writers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they said like publicly they were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hey we want to make it so that some like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a football player who doesn't care about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fantasy can enjoy right and it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay so yeah the writers just fully </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> admit that they dumbed it down yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it just went dumb and yes those moments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that everyone was waiting for these big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fights and these big like collidings of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Worlds and all of these like kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rivalries coming out to play would have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> been [ __ ] amazing if they were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> written correctly oh no but they won but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously they were still it was still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as a fan who would probably watched Five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Seasons a part of you is still like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is still kind of cool like you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> still like this the battles you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's kind of hard and do you think that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> happened because like the fan base got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> more like I guess more generalized </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because there's a few reasons so there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a few reasons one is that they kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ran out of books to uh adapt yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the books only went to about halfway you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> could see such a big shift in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> writing from when they just ran out of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> materials because uh I believe Joe R </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Martin gave him like gave them the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Baseline of where the story yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but not like the nuances right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I you know I I look at this late </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> season of Game of Thrones and I'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where these character ends up where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> these characters end up make sense story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wise how they ended up there does not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> make sense at all yeah you know a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> things were also mentioned and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never brought up again yeah and also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they had requested I can't remember it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was supposed to be 10 seasons yeah and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for some reason it ended up being eight </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and so they rushed to feel you feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that it's eight like but even with how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> bad the writing was I I don't know if it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> even would have still been good by the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> end of it because it was so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I mean I see I I don't I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> think it was [ __ ] I think like okay but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if season it was hot garbage dude see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay season that hot Garbage I'd say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> season five it was yeah five five to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> seven it's like a solid eight eight hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> turn seven was not good seven was not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good I don't like seven either I think I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think five is where you start to see the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cracks six is where it starts to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> worrying seven is where you're like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh it's ruined and then eight is like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God oh God oh God it was so bad it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really it was horrible could you imagine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you've been with something for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 12 10 years of your life and then right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> at the end they're like let's just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it all up let's make it [ __ ] and and I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thought I genuinely thought I was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm over Game of Thrones I'm done I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> don't care about this world anymore yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm I I do not yeah and then House of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> dragons started it's so good and it made </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me realize just how amazing like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> world of Game of Thrones is and I'm sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> people watching this don't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about Game of Thrones but generally the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> world is so interesting I think it's one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of if not my favorite like fantasy world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it is it is I think the way it's been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> built up is so realistic and you could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> see some kind of parallels to the real </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> world and how seriously politics is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> right no that's that's that's that's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason I got invested in the world of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Game of Thrones and that's the reason I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really still enjoyed the later Seasons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's because you got to see different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aspects of this world collide together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I just you know when you've when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've watched enough things I've you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just come to realize you I know all my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tastes are you know I can still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> appreciate good television but I know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what core elements appeal to me and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there are more core elements that appeal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to me in the later seasons of Game of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thrones even if it was more messily </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> executed and I've just come to value </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that more and I feel like there are a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of shows out there there are a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of I mean I [ __ ] like I thought of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> course I would say this I [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> isekai right but like but like I'm sorry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like there are enough games enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shows enough movies that are out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that might not be perfectly executed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> might not have the best execution but I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still on a personal enjoyment level </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still really really like even more so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than maybe some critically you can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> clip critically Acclaim shows in that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> same genre yeah because if to me like if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I were to use like an anime analogy for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me someone who's never seen Game of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Thrones it sounded like it started off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> as like you know the the political </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fantasy and you know very nuanced type </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of heavily detailed world of something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like Kingdom yeah and then went to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> something like fairy tale yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it went it went where it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> nothing makes sense but the main guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wins and there's lots of big fights it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just like it's insane when you when you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watch uh oh you read about how you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> very subtle things have happened in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> show you're like this is insane like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> level of detail yeah yeah and and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> thought that's put into how all of these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worlds and characters interact is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> insane yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> um it's Kingdom to fairy tale yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's genuinely Game of Thrones showing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it yeah from the sounds of it yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> probably why I enjoy it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but hopefully he finishes the books </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean like I would still have preferred </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the later Seasons with all these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> elements compliance we with the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nuances of like that would be in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> perfect world right but I still go I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> still got what I wanted and I was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> entertained thoroughly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> um and you know I was just I was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> thinking is this really hotter than my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bread take you know yes yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like oh all I was trying to say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is I have my own [ __ ] yeah you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to understand right I think the Game of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Thrones ending in final season was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the biggest betrayals of like TV </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to the fan base more than Game of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Thrones it's very on brand yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's literally on brand like can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you think of a TV show that burned its </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fan base harder like I I genuinely can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I can't think of anything that is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up to was that hyped it was that big of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a deal that [ __ ] up that bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like no no fairy tale no they [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still love it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm plenty of shows go to [ __ ] but you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> okay not on the scale that Game of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thrones did it right this was like a you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> know everything it did literally it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like a day and night difference it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like it went from everybody loves this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] to now everyone in the western </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> world was talking about yeah yeah it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Non-Stop and it also just goes to show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> clearly how impactful that was that when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah they were able to green light so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> many spin-offs that you know even though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone was like Game of Thrones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] sucks that when they brought out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this new prequel that they shoveled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shoved way too much [ __ ] money into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that the moment the first episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> dropped everyone was like hype </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so good everyone get back on this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's actually hype it's actually good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and to be fair the first season was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] amazing they only have like one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> book um to work off of and it's finished </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the story is completely done yeah but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're gonna make like three or four </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seasons from just one book </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and it's insane like even the George </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> RR Martin has said that some of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> characters in the TV show are portrayed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> better in the TV show than in his mind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the book oh wow he's like he uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a character in particular that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was done really well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he said like I wish I could go back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and redo those pages now I wish I could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> take them out because it's so much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> better on TV it's so so so so so good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> please if you got burnt on Game of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Thrones give House of dragon a shot it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so worth your time it's so good yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's probably one of my favorite like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> first seasons of TV in a long time wow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> all right yeah I mean I I will finish it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> so so good it's I I will I will reserve </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> my opinion I'm sure everyone's raring to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hear my opinion on House of dragons it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comes back later </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna kill you gone if they added </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> some more armor then I would have liked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it yeah I mean it's it's good like like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I said I'm I I always I with certain TV </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shows I can appreciate I can always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> appreciate good TV but sometimes I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes I'm just waiting for something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to interest me and I don't always know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what that is sometimes it's a certain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like plot element sometimes it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the cinematography or the way it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> filmed or something like that yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I get it there are just some there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some shows is where it's just like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can't explain why I like this like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know it sucks yeah well I just like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know love Island you know like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that as an example </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Love is Blind for example right like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] love that show I know that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> show's trash it's just it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reality TV right but and I can't explain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> why it's good I just can't stop watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it you know it's like it's like and he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is a guy show right it's like you can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> explain why it's good you probably know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it sucks but you're probably gonna keep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> watching it has has that has there ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> been a show that you you know is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> flawed not not like it's not like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that's like obviously trashy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but but you know it's like flawed not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> executed perfectly but there's not been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> another show like it and you're just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know what I'm I'ma look over it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know I still enjoy it because like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for me I I recently just made a video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about it it was recreaters which is it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> got like such a unique idea in terms of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just like you know when I watch a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched it by the way oh you watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it yeah yeah I completely forgot about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it yeah because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because one thing I've noticed is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you eat like that that kind of show you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> either think it's just okay but everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who likes that show really really really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] likes that show yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and I'm one of those people and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's just because it was like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> wasn't like the best executed way just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had such an interesting unique idea that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you don't see anywhere else that you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like okay you know maybe I don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> really give a [ __ ] I don't really give a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] I've really enjoyed it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely like it was definitely like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> polarizing show when it was airing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I remember it's like you either </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like [ __ ] love this show or you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah oh yeah I do remember when it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is because I I remember the conversation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> surrounding it yeah and I watched it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I only watched four or five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episodes and I stopped because yeah too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much talking yeah exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> um yeah and it was at the pace bogged </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> down a lot yeah yeah because like I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think that's why a lot of you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why the indie game scene has like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> grown so much whereas it's like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these game developers who instead of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to compete against the AAA games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing like the you know as much as I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> love God of War it does very much go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with the AAA game formula at least it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> deserves the triple a title it deserves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the Triple A game title and like a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of other AAA games but I feel like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> indie game scene has grown so much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you have a lot of these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> developers who are just like I really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this one idea and I don't see any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> other game doing just this one idea of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing it really really well huh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is that name a better jumping all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll wait Mario </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not as good yeah my man's invented I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> guess I guess James games like jumping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you take this really really cool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> idea yeah focus on nothing else but that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> core idea is he gonna appeal to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> masses no but the people who like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they really really really like it you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know and I feel like one of the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> games that came out you know in the past </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five ten years A lot of them have been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Indie Games yeah yeah when you talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> about like like undertale when that was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> out right that was insane that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> everywhere yeah I still gotta play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> undertale it's so good all memes aside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> megalovania and sex memes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't give a [ __ ] megalovania is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> probably one of the best [ __ ] music </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a video game I've heard in a long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time I know the memes exist but every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> time I hear I'm like I play that [ __ ] at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the gym I'm just like this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> true hype for the gym it gets me pumped </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> up I'm like I gotta defeat Sans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> God what are you gonna ask will I still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> enjoy it yes despite the facts that I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> been exposed to so much of it I think so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I think like that yeah no matter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how you get exposed to it I think the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ultimately the experience you have with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is definitely going to be different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> from him I feel it's a very personal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> game where like you know because again I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> feel the story is very dependent on how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you perceive it and how you want to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about it because it has the multiple </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> endings and stuff yeah yeah yeah so it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I feel it's it's a really good game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to just kind of like sit down and play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with yourself and really just like get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> fully immersed in it yeah um because I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel like I don't know I tried streaming </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it once and I'm like I couldn't really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> get into it because there's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> too many outside Falls just like yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> think I would say it's a game to just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like play on your own terms yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> um also the music is and story is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing because Toby Fox yeah the story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is really good I mean I care about it so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's saying something that's that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tough to get me to be like Oh I'm sad is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all to say that I think Toby Fox is a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> better musician than he's a Storyteller </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> uh I don't know I I I'm not sure what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other music he's done he did some music </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for Pokemon he did just a lot of pieces </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the new people he's very talented </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> either way he's super tough this is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is like no matter what which one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's better at he's still better than me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> talking about like very Niche games that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would you know only appeal to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's been a game series that I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> been thinking about getting into it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a very very Niche jrpg series oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> God </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something like this you would [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hate Connor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um but I don't I don't even know if I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have the heart to commit to this right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what uh have you ever heard of like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trails of atlia series or Trails yes I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have heard about it okay so I've never </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> played it so so I've been like so for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the past like two months I've been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trying to like psych myself up to see if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's if it's worth getting into so so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let me that's so familiar okay let me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> break let me break this down to you okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> so I I I hear like bits and pieces of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this of this game series right and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first thing I search up is how to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get into the trails series on YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I swear to God one of the top videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the the video was how do how to how to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get into the trail series one hour and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 50 minutes long </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bro and I was like oh oh boy oh boy and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was I was like surely surely there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shorter video than one hour 15 minutes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the shortest video I could find was a 20 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minute explanation that's the shortest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the shortest so this is this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like setting up the stage for the type </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of game series that this this game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> series is okay yes yes I have I have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> seen this before yeah that's the kiseki </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> series yeah yeah so I've never gone into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them though because I've heard it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's got such a high Benchmark to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> into it yes yes so so before before even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> deciding okay so I'll explain to you Joe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I've done I've I've done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> research just to see if I want to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into this game okay I haven't even just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> played the game I've watched like I've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watched like these full videos just to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> see if I wanted to play it right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh because it's a game series that has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ran on for about 15 years or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah right it's got 11 games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and what what I find really really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> interesting and why I'm like oh should I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> commit to this game is that every game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is following on from one giant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> overarching story so it's it's a game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you have it's according you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> according to a lot of the people that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> play it's got one of the best examples </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of World building in gaming period it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like the one piece of games I'm sure I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> could [ __ ] make a big block yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so it's it's like it takes place in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this one all 11 games takes place in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this one kind of like big universe right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and each game it kind it's it's similar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to I guess something like Game of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thrones right where you know you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> individual story arcs in different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> countries different areas of this world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that slowly interconnect and mingle and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> start like characters from previous </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> games start to like have a proper big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> effect on characters on story arcs in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a different country and then slowly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> start to mingle in and collide together </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like [ __ ] that that's that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sounds like that sounds that sounds like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> season six again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that sounds like everything I want in a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] game that sounds like everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I want in a video game series 11 games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it sounds like and it's still ongoing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> God I'm never gonna [ __ ] see you all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right it kind of sounds like the Dune of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video games you know kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> different planets and like the planets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> interact with one another yeah it's all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> based in this one yeah and like one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the biggest things I've heard is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not like it's not like different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> games Cameo into each other it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like one person cameos into this this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different game it's like prop games have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a proper impact on what happens stressed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> out yeah like the story the story arcs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of one game have a proper impact to what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happens in a different country different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> country story arc and I'm like holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know gone I'm about to finish the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Pokemon game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're committed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's honestly like I I remember I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember like reading something about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like this this sounds something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like I could be interested in and the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more I researched more I'm like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this this seems like a game that I would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really enjoy but yeah I can't 11 games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 11 games maybe I'll just watch one other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> video just uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> let me watch one more hour and 30 minute </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> video so the thing is is Imagine This </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> RPG where every single the NPCs that you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> meet you can actually play them in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> later years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you have like 30 plus characters that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just that just means every character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> matters in every character oh yes oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that sounds like okay I've seen this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> first game trails in the sky yeah uh I I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I had a friend who had this uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> on like Windows I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and he was like yeah because I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> specifically remember I remember the bar </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of Entry being so high for this game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> series because my friend was like he was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> playing this game and I'm like oh that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a really cool game what is it and he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like you shouldn't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't need to you don't want to know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should every character matter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I disagree I don't think every character </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> should matter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> means if it's if it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if they'll be ones who impact that story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> more but I think it's okay to have NPCs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and characters that don't really do much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think it's a cool concept where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you can be NPCs and someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> else's story at the same time that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't mean you can't have your own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> story which it sounds like it's it's see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because I've read the Dune books and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's exactly the same okay it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like the NPCs in this first book </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> are now the main characters in this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> ladder book that makes sense I like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Dune world I just think that when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just the way you're describing it to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it sounds awful um because at least Dune </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like hey here's a nice there's a nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like sandwich have a little bite of this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sandwich right and then it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> ginormous and you don't realize how big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the sandwich is before you get a bite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like well that tastes pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> good actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> does this not sound like that too no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> this sounds like that's only because you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know how many that's only because people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know how many games are in this season I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know how much Dune there is but also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I I just was like oh if I can watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the movie it seems good you know that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a palatable way to to well then I'll do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this I would be like oh play this first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> game so if you good yeah and if it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good you had to watch an hour video just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just to play the game we're talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> about that's no that's not accessible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let me see how long it takes on average </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to beat the first game this is too much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for me it was it was mostly just I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just tell me you won't you don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want 100 other games but you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll get into this 500 hour game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> collection yes yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I I okay like I said if I know that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a payoff if I know that there is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that can not be a payoff worth if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's something that I really like and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> really appeals to me I will be willing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to grind through Heaven and Hell to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] get to that according to how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> long to beat main story 40 hours easy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> easy for one game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but if you care about the NPCs yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it says completionist is 65 which is not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> too bad but you [ __ ] mean not too bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's a full-time job for a week dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> completionist for like Final Fantasy 10 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like 120 hours I think that I've done </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that before I think game devs and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on G's like because you know I used to I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> used to care about gamer school why I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like Pac-Man and Shameless School Xbox </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> games oh yeah oh you told me because I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> know that sometimes you like play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> against someone in card right and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> want to [ __ ] talk them and you open up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> their profile like oh it's gonna go 200 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> games yeah they'd open up my profile </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it'd be like 90 000 game of school and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'd be like oh [ __ ] I want to mess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> with this guy well no I want to be the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> same way if I interact with another jrpg </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> player they'll be like oh you're a jrpg </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fan what have you played and then I'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be like finish the entire Trail </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> seriously be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my God </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I like the quantifiable number and so I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> used to just play games a lot and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would just play some games that were bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but there is a quantifiable number 11 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> games is it like a score a score that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you can show to other people and people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> see right oh so that's what I enjoyed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but I would play games I didn't even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like just to get the stupid score I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> would like buy games that were rated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> easy online to get 1 000 like full game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of score because you'd only get 1 000 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> gamer score in every game and a DLC you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> could add more you were gaming the games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what happened there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like three years where I was obsessed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with this thing where I was like I just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> care about getting this number go up I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get that so I would play like I bought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like lost the game you know lost the TV </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> series I bought that game because it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like five bucks just to get a thousand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> games because it was really quick to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a thousand Gamers score and then you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> know I I also then some of my friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> won a game of school and I was like well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll do it for you if you give me 200 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Microsoft points I'll get you I'll give </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you like 5 000 game of score and I would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just do it in a day because I had like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> loads of games hustling game of schools </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I would I would if someone won a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> game of score because I I again I wanted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanted points so I would kind of do I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would figure out ways through gaming I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like how can I use my talent gaming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to get Microsoft </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gaming so what are your what are your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> talents I I'm really good game really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> good and addicted to this gaming thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> can I get money from it or can I get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> somewhere to get more games from it so I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> would like mess I would like my friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would want some people to do it and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would message people I'm like hey if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you want game of score do it no I said A </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sketch choose [ __ ] but I actually did it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like if they gave me the points I would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> log in their account and I would just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> play these games hey kid you wouldn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> gave a score but then if they wanted me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do specific games they'd be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oscar that's that's a toffee dude all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right I'm gonna need more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then and then I realized oh you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just take the internet out of your Xbox </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get a USB and like download a file and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it will just [ __ ] do it for you and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like and then I felt really dumb </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that I was spending like a day or two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing this oh my god um but yeah no I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would I was obsessed with it I would buy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> games for it I would do achievements </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was stupidly hard spend hours like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> days like Halo I would spend days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> getting all the Halo achievements </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I mean that makes sense and and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> then and then I would get infuriated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I would buy a game that I thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was good and they would have impossible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> achievements in it and you know which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ones were always the worst jrpgs always </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> always the worst 100 completion yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Final Fantasy these stupid [ __ ] games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> would be like get every single item in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the game it's like yeah you are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> psychopaths like you you willingly chose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> this achievement [ __ ] me I I did that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the new 7R though yeah that's stupid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I I think the reason I just never 100 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> games was because I did it once with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Tails and then I was like never again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> never 100 of the tails game yeah I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> sorry I loved it that to me that's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 200 hours you know you can remember back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in the day when you only had like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one game to play until next Christmas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sure sure like to me for me that was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tails that was when I had time and I was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like I don't know what to do I have no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> other videos I think that like having </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like like having to go somewhere for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like one day it was like made me a busy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> man and then yeah I could spend the rest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> of the days playing video games I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like damn that one day thing that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> crashing I'm like bro I'll kill Stacy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> games now I'm like I will kill for one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> hour yeah sure I literally do anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> for an hour yeah it's really weird for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me with the video games because I could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> never play for like one or two hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stints a noise if I if I have a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game I like I need to play for at least </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like four hours oh man I've been able to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enjoy a game for like 20 minutes and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> then just do something else as hype </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right it takes me 20 minutes just to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like invested into like the game that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> why OverWatch and games like that are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty fun because you can just do like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two games 30 minutes go back to whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you're doing pretty nice so I just play </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> module </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you can get a quick game out of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you want to reset your brain you want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like kind of just take your mind off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what the work is for like 20 30 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I mean maybe you don't want to take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it then like one game turns into like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> two games I'm pretty good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> at that point I'm just like and then at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that point I'm just like well I'm five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> bro like going on tour with Connor off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> entire hold up no no that's different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that is different because uh our entire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> schedule revolved around whether Conrad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> started the game of Kia [ __ ] tiona we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> would be like yo Conor rehearsals in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> five minutes Connor's like but but I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just started I just started the game I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just started a game of DFT guys I never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> played near our rehearsal time that's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] lie no no and most I would push </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it back five minutes that's that's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> true I would play a lot of TFT because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we didn't really have anything to do a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of the time yeah so I was like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just game but in normal work it's like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> will pretty much I will work from like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> nine to ten Non-Stop and then I'll have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to take a break at some point and play </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> some games because always I'll get my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> brain will be like wait 9am to 10 AM 10 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> p.m okay I have to say I'm like I'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> work yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know I normally have to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> stream and then I'm like all right I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> have to do real work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now I'm gonna answer emails too much fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I gotta I gotta feel like I didn't have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> fun yeah exactly speak for yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stream is like people pure gamer right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> here stream is definitely worked for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah streams work for me I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually like it it's fun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really a game for me I was thinking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like should I stream god of war and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was just like no I just because I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wanted to just be like immersed in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> game and just say like damn this show is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really good think of the five Subs yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah the only way that we'll be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> able to get through the trail series is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> if we stream till last year like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> realistically so that's the thing right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if there's a game that is too long it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> makes no sense to play it off stream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know it's a big time sink so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you should play but then there's no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> point doing it on stream either because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then viewers will just fall off yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> true maybe yeah maybe because I tried to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> do that with Yakuza 7 and like after 11 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> streams I don't care people just don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> care so I'm like [ __ ] it I'll just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> finish this game because it depends on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the game because like you know Pokemon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it makes sense right yeah because it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you can just tune in whenever you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> immediately know what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happening there's no concrete story you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can just immediately be like oh you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to catch some Pokemon cool I'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> join in but like you know 10 streams </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into Yakuza 7 where it's like the story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is pretty much fleshed out at that point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like oh I don't know what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is happening therefore I'm not gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stay I think people need to enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> people need to have played a game or has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to have like a really hardcore fan but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like you know Final Fantasy online </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> or you know yenshin even you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> invention streamer yeah because that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> why you're such an easy Grace you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come through that streamer yeah the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> streamer that plays that game yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> such an investment and that you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anyone who would want to watch would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> also be interested in that game yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but yeah honestly it's it's also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> games especially as well so you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> who's going to be the world's first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Trail stream </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there's got to be one out there right no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one cares don't do that do not do that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because like Trails I'm like this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this I see some light trails and I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like this will never ever ever be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> popular but holy [ __ ] it like it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> speaks to me there's five Japanese dudes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> somewhere in the world who are like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> hot most hardcore Trails fans who are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just like please give it to me the more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I get into streaming the more I want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> do non-game streams like the more I want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to do like I want to go fishing yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's the OG game yeah can I eat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> today like I feel like I want to play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the analog like I'm more interested in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> streaming like classical stupid [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like like fishing or like outdoor stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I think is like kind of games or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know games before games yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know activities </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah I don't know why yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> let's discover yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> real life stuff is great but what are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they gonna patch this mechanic man I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> can't believe fishing the time the fish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is too long like the fish the fish is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like too much RNG man they're like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is just like gotcha but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] yeah so I've done I've actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> done fishing a few times in Japan now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> all right I did the fishing with mailing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the ocean yeah uh that was that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] hard mode fishing that was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hard much harder than uh Lake fishing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> lake fishing and River fishing is nice I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like that that's like the perfect battle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah you you get fishes uh at a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Pace yeah you know and it's much more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> relaxing as well yeah yeah you can sit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> down on the boat you're like [ __ ] oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> God am I gonna get a fish I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for like four hours and then you don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> get anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just [ __ ] yeah and then you kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like you want to go to the toilet you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> have to go in this shitty little boat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like I just I everything about it I just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> want to piss off the edge of the boat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dude yeah yeah I went on this uh fishing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> thing with Maylene and it was it was fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just too long it was like it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like eight hours on like on the water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I had done it three hours man yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I went like Lake fishing again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after when like sea fishing would mail </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in I just realized damn Lake fishing is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just it it's just so much more chill and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the friends who made along the way yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I go see fishing I was like oh this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is why fishing is a job you know because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's hard it's hard work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm wet I'm soaking and you know I we'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> be I'd be there for hours right and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> would I would be staring at these like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> old Japanese men who were like nuts at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it and I was literally copying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everything they were doing I thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they had the straps I wasn't doing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like I I would I swear to God I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would like literally one for one mimic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly what he was doing and I could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not get a fish to save my life I got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like two fish total this these dudes bro </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like that's like that's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being like you know oh I'm gonna play </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Dark Souls and watch this Dark Souls no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I just do exactly what they do I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> recognized it like I'm definitely not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these dudes have been doing it their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whole life yeah and the thing that I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> liked about like in sea fishing was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really [ __ ] hot because the technique </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> matters a lot yes um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> whereas in a lake you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> blop yeah wait and then that's it yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's good it's fun you can chat you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chill out you want to drink a beer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've got to like pull it you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> pulling it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these dudes are nuts dude these Japanese </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> men I mean it's in it's in the blood man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it is a generation man throws it in two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seconds got like five on one hook I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what the [ __ ] is happening man and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's just like at a pity he's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> here's a fish genuinely out of pity he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like bro I've caught too many I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hey you want one yeah sea fishing was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just frustrating for me because I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the [ __ ] am I doing wrong I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> actually have no idea what I'm doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> insane yeah million's been a ton and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> million wasn't getting anything don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you do this often can you be getting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> more fish yeah because I did the exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same way where there were some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese men like catching like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> literally a bucket full of fish yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like mimic everything they're doing the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> right way nothing yeah I throw it in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> nothing throw it in nothing because they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> had the the [ __ ] like cracked uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> fishing pole that's what I'm guessing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah I had the the school the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> school uh Sports Hall pop fishing pole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like yeah we got a pole we put a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> line on the end yeah yeah I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you gotta stick with a piece of strings </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they felt so bad for us that when we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> docked and went back in because you pay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like 15 bucks to go out and fish yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're allowed to catch as many fish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> as you want so there's some corn they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> give you free fish as well yeah the dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's it yeah hold on we caught like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ton the other day he owns a bag </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess he just felt bad yeah yeah with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the same thing but it's also as well I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feel them doing that is like backhanded </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like the game ring you was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> no I could do better I mean it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I was trying to just clarify I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not frustrated because I didn't get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> enough fish I'm frustrated because I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hated the whole the vibe of it and how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> long you were dead like a rainbow yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you know you you dock and then you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drive out on the boat for like an hour </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and you're just the sun because it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was in like August so the sun is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> destroying you as well and you're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> this this [ __ ] sucks because unlike </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> unlike Lake fishing sea fishing is a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> commitment you can't just be like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just just talk somewhere let's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chill out you know somewhere go yeah no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just just go can't pull the camping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chairs and put the beer yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly I can't do that it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> commitment and unfortunately the sea is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the sea you know and if if if you need a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> place to rest you still like it's still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rocking a lot yeah because it's the sea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's a lot more intense than Lake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fishing I was actually like sweating at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a point doing uh doing sea fishing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's like it's a workout it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so much more intense because you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> constantly having to do something it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> not a passive activity it's an active </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> activity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um but you get you get like bigger fish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for it you know that's that's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> trade-off sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if you can catch it yeah a little fish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are fine too they taste good yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah they're fine good so I want the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> five stars though man I'm waiting for my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> first five star man you have a catching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> big fish is way harder than getting a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> little fish like a lot lot more yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I know but then we're not capable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of that guy well we gotta stay in our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> lane 20 years too late but I I just want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to know what that feels like you know I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> wanna I wanna know I want to know yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> us me Immortals we haven't been fishing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> for like 20 years I don't get to we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> don't get to do that no I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there's other sports I really want to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as well more I want to do more Sports </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> essentially as well I'm the same yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to do more kayaking I want to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot more of that I wanna I wanna surf </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as well I went surfing with Felix the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> other day yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> intense like it is it's a good workout </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a incredible workout but I it just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> made me realize how unfit I actually am </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no I knew but like it just it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reaffirmed my suspicions right because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like I was probably out there for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what maybe two hours yeah and I was just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] destroyed like because it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the part that it's it's the paddling out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that just takes all the energy no and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe it's because like I heard I saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some people you know saying like oh it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you were in like cold Waters and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just saps the energy out of you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> more than like summer warm Waters and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff like that but I think that's only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up to a certain extent like you need to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be at a certain level of Fitness guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but that's actually you guys are on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> copium yeah that's copium it's like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know but um no it's really fun like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> even if like I didn't I probably maybe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> caught one wave and I didn't even stand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up for it obviously but like even just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like catching that one wave while on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your stomach it does seem hard it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hard it is very hard but it's super </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] fun and like yeah I definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> want to go back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> um yeah yeah so I remember trying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> surfing for the first time as well it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was so much [ __ ] fun but like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> said you spend most of your end energy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not actually doing surfing it's actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like paddling out it's like getting out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you have to like go against the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> waves yeah you don't realize how much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> energy that takes Until you realize you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> spend all this energy to maybe like to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get one chance to catch like a wave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and if you don't catch it then you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you [ __ ] up and you gotta paddle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out all over again you know yeah so it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a lot it's a lot of energy it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of waiting as well it's a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> waiting especially if like the waves are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of mediocre like it was when we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> went yeah yeah um it's just like a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> of like oh is it hit no oh is it no and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just sitting in the water for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe 30 minutes yeah freezing your ass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> off right because you're not moving at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all and then the one burst of energy you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to use to catch that wave that you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> might not even actually catch yeah you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just get way close to the Sean you go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> well [ __ ] now I gotta paddle back out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> again yeah and use up all this energy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not serving it's like with skiing or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> snowboarding it's [ __ ] easy because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh like the [ __ ] ski lift does all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the work for you yeah it's like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like if you went skiing except the ski </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lift wasn't lurking working and you had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to walk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well I guess I gotta go all up all the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way again where's the ski let's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> surfing yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just like pick me up drop me off and put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me in the ocean but I'll show you I I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know why am I stupid I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what's I wonder what outdoor sports that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are cool that would work for streaming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like okay surfing doesn't work there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> water if there's you are getting wet or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> submerged it doesn't work anything like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that done kayaking could work but if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go too far out to the ocean there's no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> signal yeah yeah so you gotta kayak </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> around somewhere maybe in a river </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> snowboarding maybe see okay I thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about this I thought skiing or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> snowboarding could could work and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> technically it's possible but I wondered </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> would it look [ __ ] on camera because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's literally just White </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh it's just white and then you're going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fast down so there's like opportunities </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to talk and stuff but I'm like I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> know if it could be interesting you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would also need I guess maybe like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wide lens to you know kind of capture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you and the rest of the thing because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like the the camera I have is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very wide okay it might work yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I guess also like is there like but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like some mountains I know don't have a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> great signal either yeah it depends it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> depends depends on the mountain depends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know I just want to do more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weird outdoor stuff no that's right I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just I want to do more Sports Outdoors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's hard to convince anyone I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> down okay okay good good yeah I'll hold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you to that yeah lean mountain climber </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because I went because I went surfing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> with Felix and then the week after we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> went to driving range </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> as [ __ ] it's like oh I actually kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> missed doing this during the pandemic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because I just got so [ __ ] lazy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because we couldn't go outside didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> couldn't move our body because no one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> else was outside yeah all the places </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were closed but now everything else is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> open and people are like yeah I kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> want to get back into shape or like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of want to move my body I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> well let's [ __ ] go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I like trips that are like focused </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> around doing an activity right where you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like maybe go for two days to like kayak </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> somewhere yeah yeah or to surf or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something I like that because I feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like okay well it's a it's a holiday but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> also you get to relax you do some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> exercise it's like you've got to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some endorphins </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of those sports that require </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like expensive or you need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> equipment or someone is good to teach </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you around yeah yeah a lot of the a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the sports require knowledge entry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> points it's like it's yeah it's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> point of entry right where yeah that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> part of the reason I never went skiing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or snowboarding just because you need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone who can help you yeah the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> barrier Adventure was so high yeah no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one in my family ever skied or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> snowboarded when I was younger so I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just like well I guess uh I guess I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> never going yes I'm never going yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that's true actually it for sure helps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah um I I wondered there's definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a scene for very odd extreme sports I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know there's like a scene for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um actually hunting in German man really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah you can you can you can uh like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> with live animals or just like the clay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pigeons live animals oh really you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> do it for some reason I stumbled across </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something and I was reading about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's quite interesting it seemed like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's you have to it's a very long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> process to get a gun in Japan yeah it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> um but it can be done and you can hunt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in Japan didn't know there was a scene </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> for hunting in Japan didn't think so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> either yeah I thought everything was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] protected no no no there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> certain animals that you can hunt oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> certain Birds but know that fun fact </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan often has a scene for very like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Niche Sports oh yeah but you need to I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> wouldn't even know how you'd even begin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to get into stuff like that here that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the problem is like a lot of like I feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japan is the one country where there are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so many small cool little niches that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can get into whether it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> physical or just like hobby based or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something like that but like it's either </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the point of entry is so high or the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> community surrounding it is so small and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> hidden or gatekeeping yeah that it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like kind of hard to be like can I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> join yeah you know without them being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh you want to be a train or taco </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> name five trains it's like it's like uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know it's like [ __ ] off you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like there's always that because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like because I wanted to do a video on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like kind of the weird like you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like the the small little niche otaku </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spheres like the train or tacos but the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> problem is a lot of those people just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> don't want to be public about it and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> don't want to talk about it because they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> don't want it to be like a mainstream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> thing you know they want to keep it in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their small Niche I know that some of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the train attacks is that game is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> gatekeepy I don't know maybe it's it it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is geek yeah it totally is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if you ever watched the James May Series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Japan oh yes he talked to some train </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> attackers and he was like I need a TV </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> products so why do you like trains and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like and he was just saying so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's like all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all right that's cool I actually saw a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gun store in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like live guns yeah like a gun store I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> walked past a gun store and I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh where was it shibia no I remember I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> walked past it I can only think of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> one in [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was thinking as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I I remember walking past it and being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that's a lot of guns wow and I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like that like real guns not like real </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> real guns real guns definitely real guns </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that was definitely real okay I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> seeing because I saw the some of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stuff outside and I was like oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that's real that's real [ __ ] because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> airsoft guns they'll have what's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> word they call it they have um the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll have like Survival game written </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> over it so yeah yeah yeah I doubt real </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> guns would have Survival Games a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> survival game yeah that's really cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they call it hardcore yeah they call </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> airshop Survival game in Japan yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> which makes it sound way more hype than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Airsoft see Airsoft is a bad name I feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like it makes it sound way wimpier than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it actually is yeah oh how soft is it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> survival games Survival the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh [ __ ] all right I'm down I I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Airsoft done itself dirty with that name </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> um yeah where you can fish your own fish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah yeah okay so yes you fish you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> fish the the fish and then you eat it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and and they'll ask you how you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> how you want it prepared but these fish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are like dead so you have to like stab </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> them with the hook you don't yeah you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't catch them you kind of have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shimmy the hook into the part of their </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> body and then drag them out yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very like oh this doesn't feel right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and it's like really oh it's gross </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and also like they don't even use the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> fish that you even fish up right like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have like a different fish prepared </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know I don't know if that's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rumor but I mean I I would hope so just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from seeing how half dead some of these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fish I'm like I don't know if I'm I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know if they're good to eat like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> food is mad as well that's all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's fine I mean it's it's fine just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's mid it's just like fine the sushi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was fine it's fine I was just like damn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it it's acceptable I wish I ate other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Sushi like what just anything else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> anything else </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah Sushi chains in Japan even like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 100 yen ones pretty [ __ ] weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> they're pretty decent they do the track </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> as long as it's not don't get the sushi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> from the conveyor belt just order it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from the tablet yeah get it fresh yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean I I noticed now that it's even if I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> go to a conveyor Bel sushi place it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rare that it's full of sushi anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most of the time people just order from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the tablets nowadays yeah yeah and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like why would I want the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sushi that's been going around for 40 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minutes yeah yeah Sushi they just made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah exactly like that sounds much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> better I'll do that thank you yeah even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like the cheapest Sushi change you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> find in Japan is like better than some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the expensive Sushi though like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> worldwide so that's why I in a sense I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> prefer going to like cheap conveyor belt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sushis and some of like the more higher </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> end sushi places because it's rare that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm ever full in like the higher end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sushi places you know yeah yeah but is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that what it is yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's rather than that I'm ever full and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just feel guilty like ordering more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from the chef to be like you didn't feed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me enough give me more and then you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> order like one or two more pieces I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] how do I tell I don't think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they mind I don't think they're mine no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> they don't mind because they're still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> getting the money for yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean he you know he'll eat like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> majority of like the fish and stuff like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that but you know some of the weirder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ones like like he doesn't like not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> though or like the sperm sacks or [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_02> about it's some of the other things that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they can find in Japan which might be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> having like a little bit harder I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a sushi is like I want them to try that </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> yeah I've seen videos of these from </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> depends when are they coming </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> I think in January </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I just holy [ __ ] maybe like maybe like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> nabe of some kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> although the raw egg might throw them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> off a bit yeah I'm Gonna Make Them Eat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sukiyaki I'm gonna be like you gotta </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> make you gotta make them yeah yeah I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think I can get away with raw egg you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know I think they'll complain about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think it's weird but as soon as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they try it hopefully hopefully </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> hopefully I mean I was I feel like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're younger it's really easier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right because you're more open to trying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right obviously if you're older </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you've been eating the same things your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whole life and you're like why sure I've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> survived without raw egg I don't think I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> want to try it it's just like it's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese Cuisine is just so vastly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different from like Western Cuisine yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know now the world's become more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> let's say like globalized and everything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that so people our age I think I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like we've got we've had more of a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chance to try all these different types </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of Cuisines stuff like that yeah but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you get to a parent's age you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it was it's it was a lot harder to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> try different Cuisines back then let's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say in fact it's like surprised me so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> much just how much Choice there is now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nowadays uh UK UK went from like nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like good now exactly you know I go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to like most major cities and they have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like proper Cuisines of like every type </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whereas but I remember before you go to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a Chinese restaurant and there was only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like one type of Chinese restaurant you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know which was just basically orange </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chicken yeah orange chicken kung pao </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chicken like and now like you go to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> UK and there's like so many different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> types of Chinese restaurant which is how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it should be it's like Szechuan food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like Chinese hot pot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and I'm just like wow this Choice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't there when I was growing up in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> England God knows what the choice was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like when my parents were you know it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> might also be because maybe back in our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> parents generation there wasn't enough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like uh understanding or knowledge on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the subtle differences of a lot of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> food like that so maybe the maybe they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> existed like maybe you know like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Szechuan food and hot pot and like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know traditional Chinese food did exist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but but it was probably all just labeled </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> under Chinese food yeah right and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> probably just like oh it's it's from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> China so it must be just Chinese food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and you didn't Pro probably there wasn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> enough information out there to be like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> oh this is a different type of Chinese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> food yeah well this is a different type </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of Indian food yeah well you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anything like that right it's like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know I'm sure like back in our parents </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> day there was just like there's Asian </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> food and that's it it's Asian food and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there is non-asian I remember when I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> growing up in in Brighton at least when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> when we wanted like when we wanted </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Chinese or Japanese food they were both </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> under the same restaurant yeah it was it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't Chinese or Japanese it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Chinese and Japanese yeah it was like an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Asian fusion right it was like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> opposite in terms of like flavors yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you know Chinese food is often quite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> heavy maybe oily yeah whereas Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> food it's very light not so many spices </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> meanwhile Korean food is full of spices </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean I remember I remember when it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> growing well I remember when growing up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Korean food just wasn't a thing no no no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like you you had zero choice of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Korean cuisine and nobody knew about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> either it was either Chinese or Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Indian you know yeah and it's just weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now seeing how many different Cuisines </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are like coming up there like Vietnamese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> cuisine is like coming up as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> whereas before I was just like oh I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guess I I I've had Thai food that's you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> know that's that's just all the stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before it was like let's get up that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Asian restaurant that has Sushi Pad Thai </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like so that's everything I could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be wrong but I Jordan the Thai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> government and I think it might still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> does like they they sponsor a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people opening up Thai restaurants </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> abroad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um if they do that's five hit because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they wanted Thai food to be like really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well known right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um I'm pretty sure they did that I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> wouldn't be surprised because I think if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you look at all the foreign foods from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like southeast Asia like it's only like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Thai food is the big one like it's been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pushed the most yeah I think it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because the government was like hey we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> need to get our food out there I mean it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> makes sense when pretty much everyone in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> my parents and dad's side who emigrated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> out of Thailand started a restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> business so yeah I'm pretty sure there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a text out like there's something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> some kind of program maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there is not a single Thai person who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> has come out from outside Thailand who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't at one point in analyze yeah I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just I'm just thinking I'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we've got a fact checking okay all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what do you think 2002 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> oh 2002. yeah thousands of restaurants </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around the world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because they realize like Hey how do we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get our name on the map let's make bomb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> ass food the people are gonna be like no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I want Chinese food yeah yeah and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> think about it more right you know of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the country you know about it like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know a lot about some other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Southeast Asian countries because the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> food isn't really like pushed that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> true yeah and it's kind of it's very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> neat and food is very intrinsically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> linked to the culture too oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's right like dude I mean I swear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> half of the hype around Italy is how God </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> damn good their food is yeah you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but no one ever thinks to stop about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> their government we don't talk about the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Italian government the Italian politics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Italian politics are kind of whack but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> their food you know you think about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah everyone every single family member </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that has emigrated out of Thailand uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I've started a [ __ ] big family by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the way or in my parents generation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> started a restaurant business almost for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a restaurant business </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um yeah that that was that was like in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the 1980s though is there is there a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> particular Cuisine that you want more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people in the wall to like know about or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> try that you think is like personal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> progress in the white guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Subway sandwiches </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> damn I I really want to just try more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Southeast Asian food but worldwide </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone should know that's hard to say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> um I still think to this day Greek food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is underrated no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't like Greek food no no Greek </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Greek food Greek food is so hit or miss </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> really and dude it's all down to what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the [ __ ] sauce they put on everything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um Suzuki yeah if that [ __ ] doesn't if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that if they didn't make that properly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the food none of the Food Works I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not making good Tzatziki at a Greek </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> restaurant is being like Oh we got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> vinegar instead of soy sauce for your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> sushi it's like you know it's like such </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a staple that it's like if you [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at that point there's no going off I I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've had them I've had some amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Greek food that I thought was so good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but so often so often Greek restaurants </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> outside of Greece are so [ __ ] it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whoever runs it just hates everyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the UK in the UK or I've been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anywhere else in Europe you know I've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> gone to other places in like American </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've tried Greek food and it's like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know what it is it's so hit or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> miss really it's like Italian it's you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can normally rely on it to be decent at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> least one or two items that you like and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's always something and it's and to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be honest you you have to really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> try to [ __ ] up Italian food yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not saying that it's easy to make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but like at least the base ingredients </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are pretty readily available and the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> recipes aren't too complicated and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to really be have awful [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe I just had a good because in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Australia we have a lot of Greek </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immigrants maybe like I feel like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been to like two or three Greek </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> restaurants in Sydney and they're all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] bomb they were so good so good I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know if this is like anecdotal I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> think I've had the worst service </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> consistently in Greek restaurants really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think so I've had the best service I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like a really a dude I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that like there was a Greek </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> restaurant it's not there anymore that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was like near my house and like we would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> go there because it was quite expensive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's expensive to eat out in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Australia right we would go there for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like if it's like a family member's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> birthday or if it's like a New Year's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing or something like that some kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of Celebration and we went so often year </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after year that like the head chef and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like most of the people who worked there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just knew who we were yeah and we got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some of the best [ __ ] service ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like I've never seen my dad tip in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Australia except for at this Greek </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> restaurant every time my dad's like my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> man yeah she could have gone there yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's not there anymore I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe I need to try some restaurant more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> restaurants let's see there's some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> recommendations I mean I haven't been to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Greece so I I don't know if I've had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like other things that's nice yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything was really cheap I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that I remember the food was quite good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but that that's what makes me want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to go because I had such a good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experience at Greek restaurants in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Australia literally on the other side of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the [ __ ] planet from Greece that I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> sure the fooding actual grease is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as good if not better yeah I like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> food grease it's good yeah I feel like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> need to try more like Greek Foods uh I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think there's one thing that I feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't gel with Greek food and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just unfortunate that I just don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really like Feta cheese you know I'm not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're not only feta I don't really like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Feta a lot of people don't yeah and and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's it is it is a strong taste it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like a very very good though it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a very very strong taste a bit too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> strong for you like palettes you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> lamb though right yeah I like lamb okay </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> the mink taste like the goats I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trust someone who said Yuzu tastes like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> lemon cleaner I don't like Yuzu that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> much though I I but do you think it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tastes like lemon cleaning it's a very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> strong taste I will admit I don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if it's I want to get Emily back on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because she's the only person I've met </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that could like rival she's all of our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> teams like put together like holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every time she comes out every time she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like in private or on [ __ ] Twitter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every time like we talk about food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> she'll say something [ __ ] outrageous </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so I'm like I thought I had bad I'm just </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> maybe you've just had really bad land </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yes like in America I think they got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> many good lamps all right I don't think </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> I was like whatever let's I'll take you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to somewhere that is rigid lamb and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Hokkaido it's really good [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> yeah the genius complex yeah and I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like let's just try this it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different style you cook it on the grill </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah yeah that's so good you get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like veg on the side and it cooks and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like all right we'll try every cut </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna try a little bit of each one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because she was like I don't dislike </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> yeah and I was like well let's try it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and every single one she's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like goat's cheese and I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_00> like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what it's like it's different foods </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different occasions you know I I think I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know what it is does she not like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the gaminess of it maybe I think so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe yeah I I can't accept people don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I understand if you don't like it for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the gaminess but not for the subtle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cheese flavor that it has which it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't I don't know what she's on yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know so yeah that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> frustrating but I like lamb a lot I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't see him Welsh I love life yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like a lot of times in Wales they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't really cook it very well all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah I will say it was always lamb </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chops as well yeah I will say like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comparing like lamb to beef beef is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot harder to [ __ ] up yeah I feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lamb if you don't cook it correctly of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the meat quality is not good there is a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there is like a real strong aftertaste </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that can be very off-putting with land </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but when you get good lamb [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> incredible whoa have you ever had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone ask you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh how would you like your pork cooked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> no no someone was like do you want your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> pork medium rare and I was like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like what do you what do you mean so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I went to um uh a katsu Place katsu is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh breaded uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> pork and then like fried yeah um and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> they were like do you want it rare or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> medium rare or well done I was like what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like what do you what do you mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's tonkatsu yeah yeah I was like isn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it deep fried how do you do what I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what do you mean I was very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> confused and they were like the show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also it's pork you should not be yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the chef was like we recommend it medium </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> rare and I was like okay I guess I'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> trust you because it's your pork and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> do this a lot yeah I'll get medium rare </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was slightly pink very slightly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pink like like a little bit of pink in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the middle yeah but it was bomb it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> really [ __ ] good and I was like is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> safe yeah I assume so otherwise I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> think they'd be open isn't red pork like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of bad yeah I don't know is it can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we google this well then this is also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the country that also does like raw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chicken like it was when I say it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the one I posted on Twitter that picture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the tattoo so like it was it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> clearly all white with just very dots of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> pink in the middle so I assume they were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to cook it because often if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've ever if you've ever come to Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and you have cheap katsu it's sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it can be like fighting like it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fighting a war you're like biting really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hard to kind of separate because the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> chunks are normally quite big yeah so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you do want to it's normally at least a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> two biter and sometimes it is pretty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hard to get through it and you're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay [ __ ] man maybe it makes sense that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it would be medium rare but it worked it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> worked yeah it's a little bit pink it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> okay so that's probably why it was good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was it was tasty highly recommend it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they have it was a chain I'm sure it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gone but like I would also be a little </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> bit worried if the chef came up to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and said how would you like it I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just I was taking her back because I I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> never had that before it was like a bog </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> standard cut like corner street uh katsu </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I I I I ordered it and I was like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> well you know what do you what do you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mean like I'd never heard of Chef ask me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that and I thought he was saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something else because I thought I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thought I misunderstood yeah because I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like what the [ __ ] do you mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> medium rare what no I didn't get beef </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but now is that it was good I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> recommend it so if you ever get if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> ever get asked in Japan how do you want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> your tonkat to and if the guy recommends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> medium rare trust him he knows what he's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talking about so so bottom line with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Emily thing she tried all those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> beautiful cuts of meat right A lot of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was Australian Cuts as well if I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember and there was deer there as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> she liked the deal yeah yeah and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> she was like ghost she's in it I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she just liked I think people just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beef sometimes and I think some people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> associate like beef in the uh sorry meat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the head as chicken or beef and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pork is somewhere in the middle but I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think some people when they've only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> really eaten chicken and beef a lot they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of only really think about those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> too and they think there's the white </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> mean there's a red meat and so every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> flavor of meat in their mind is like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> tree that starts from chicken or beef so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think like some kind of I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's some kind of thing when you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> don't eat yeah I mean it's like a mental </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> thing right away you try something new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mental death and you're just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what did she expect when she said to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Welsh person I don't like lamb and I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what do you no that's not allowed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's because you've had [ __ ] laughs yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] lamb but now she's had good lamb </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> man apparently that didn't change I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't change your mind apparently at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the end of it she was like no she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't tastes like goat cheese I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the [ __ ] is your palette what is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this [ __ ] every time someone's like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> up but he just thinks it's something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> else it's like oh God are you dying it's </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> is anyone allergic to chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> uh maybe you know we should do for trash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> taste we should we should take one of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> those allergy tests and then we should </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> report our results are we allergic to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> any weird specific things oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they can give you like a test </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they prick you with like every two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thousand different yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're like all right look you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> allergic to octopus fangs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you're good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I used to be uh I used to get hay fever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I didn't and then I was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I don't know what happened I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> woke up one day and then I just did wait </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wait so you had hay fever in the UK but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> not here right no I had hay fever in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> UK yeah and then when I turned like 18 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or something I just stopped having hay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fever really yeah I don't get it in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> UK or anything anymore your body just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> decided to be a giga chat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sneezing now I told my body to get good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it did so it's like it's like when I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hear about people who like they they ate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they they ignored their lactose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> intolerance so much that they just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> somehow stopped being lactose intolerant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like you sacrificed so much no but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that but that's an actual thing that can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happen it's like because like you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> also develop it if you don't have enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Dairy rice but also you can do the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing with like cats for example yeah if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you live with the same cat that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> started off as being allergic to yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you just let your immune system just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> fight that [ __ ] for like I think it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like a couple of weeks on average yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is true because that's what happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to Chris oh okay yeah Chris was allergic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to cats but then when Chris and Charles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> suddenly be together she has a cat yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then he had to live with this cat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for you know have him anyways after a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> while he's like I'm not allergic to this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> particular cat your body just learns to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> process that particular cat's allergens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever the [ __ ] it is whatever I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> try to keep it a secret he had a cat and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> there's the the cat hair constantly kept </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> appearing on him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was so funny like really Chris </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> rookie mistake yeah but so like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that is like one way that you can just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> get over so it's really interesting in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the case with Chris it's that he's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> allergic to this one particular cat that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he lives with yeah but every other cat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's still allergic to huh and it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> your body just being like yeah you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good with this all these other ones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> though no you're still [ __ ] being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> allergic to these fruits and whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the [ __ ] any of this stuff yeah I could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could live with that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I couldn't be lactose intolerant man </SPEAKER_00>
