<SPEAKER_05> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's an export of our country, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd like you to have you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, And do I see you wearing one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, no, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because that's, you know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Stolen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't like that you've
used my own culture against me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not only have you taken the hat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you've taken it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a very good British
culture thing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly (laughs). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's taking from other cultures. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had no idea it was British culture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The act of taking- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What, to steal things? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know that is British culture, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know a top hat was British. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've stolen your culture
of stealing culture. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whether it is a British thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the top Hat is- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just see that and I think
the Monopoly man, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, when you think where's
the Monopoly rent from. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Britain, you think, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think American. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think Britain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - American? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like American, like 1920s, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like all oil trade with the Monaco, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anyway, welcome back to Trash Tastes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm your host Joey, and I'm
with Connor and Garnt as always, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this, is a somewhat special episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you couldn't already tell, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from the title, it is the
long awaited, Hentai Episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Today, we are not the boys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we are the men of culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We are the man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We are the men of culture. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I will do an obligatory disclaimer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that this is going to be
talking about very sexual stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and things in shows, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it is not appropriate for
any ages under the age of 18. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like how we hit with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this is the one where
we put a disclaimer on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> even though we've literally talked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about fucking awful shit already. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hey, all I'm saying is that okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> here's the way that we structured this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> we all gave each other three
Hentai Episodes to watch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of our favorites.
- Episode ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just one episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One episode of our favorite Hentai each. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, wait, wait, I was gonna... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - These ain't my favorite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, so this is what
I was gonna ask first, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> how did you guys pick your three Hentais? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you pick your favorite ones, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> or did you pick- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - My point was is that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> once some of us pick some
really fucked up shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we're gonna have to explain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And yeah, just a warning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we gonna... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Obviously we're not gonna show anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we are gonna talk about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, this is gonna be really weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to have playing in your
car on the way to work, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you are an audio listener. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - We will try to explain, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> what happens in the
Hentai obviously beacause, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we don't expect everyone
to have watched them all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> even though, you know, there's
gonna be like five people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the comments that are
like, "Yo, that's me." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is gonna be the one episode, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> where we talk about clips, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we can't be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yo, Medon, show the clips. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Pull up the clip Medon." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah, so we picked three episodes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for us each to watch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that was six episodes
that we needed to watch, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a row. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have never watched six
episodes of Hentai, in a row, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my fucking life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never watched
six episodes of Hentai </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a row and not jack off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was super weird
watching six episodes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and knowing that I have to
watch them you know like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an objective sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - In like analytically way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Man, I'm not gonna lie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sad, I busted a
nut to one of them man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That one was good, one of them was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I get because in my head I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some of these, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, this is like, definitely
like jack off material. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, it'd be really weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to just whip out my dick being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "This is a one that Garnt recommended.". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like in the back of my
mind the entire time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> This feels weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No qualms about that, come on? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> What do you mean it's not
like it's Garnt's work, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Garnt isn't the one drawing the frames. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not masturbating to God's thoughts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sam Garnt did a good job
on this genger that's hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I will say, I feel
like closer to your boys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after this because like, you're
not like you have a level </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of friendship where you
start recommending anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and shows for each other to watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have never in my life recommended Hentai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to watch for the boys and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, the boys are gonna enjoy this one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm looking forward to what
they think about what I like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't wait for the
weekly discussion of this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like a mixed level
of like broship and bromance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So we all chose three each. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was under the impression </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we were picking ones </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we thought were like our favorites. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So the three you picked
are your favorites? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I mean... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, the reason was that
I didn't wanna pick ones </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that were just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we would all be like,
"Yeah, that's good shit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I selected like Masterpiece, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which in its name, it's a masterpiece. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can't hate on that, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe you could give me like
a little shit debatable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What are you saying? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not a masterpiece. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I wouldn't call it that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's a masterpiece Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think just being persuasive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You 're being persuasive Garnt, come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - After seeing the three
Hentai that you recommended, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I can see why you were
thinking it's a masterpiece. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like Connor
recommended the three Hentai, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I immediately was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, I know his taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know what kind of man Connor is." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love how, like we gave
each other like a list, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Being like Joey's three
bomb, Garnt three bomb, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Connor's three bomb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't even have to see
Connor's name to know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just read the titles and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I know exactly what Connor is in to." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you know Joey you
recommends a list, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, it's all three Japanese things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Fuck knows what that is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt recommends three Japanese." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And one of mine just
has a porn English name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, obviously, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's gonna look bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, not even like the Japanese titles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - "I don't understand what they mean." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I understand. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I will elaborate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because like I didn't
pick my favorite ones, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I was the last
one to share my list. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, when you have three
Hentai to recommend, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's hard, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a hard a selection. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it's like, what'd you go for? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you go for like funny ones, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or did you go for ones
that would be good bants, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or did you go for like
your personal favorites? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you nutted to
each one on your list? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, I have too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I wouldn't say they're my favorite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, there's there's
one I haven't nutted to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which was- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, wait, wait, will get to that one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how do you nut to this one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's like, yes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have nutted to the rest
of the ones on my list but, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like, I wouldn't say that
they're my favorite ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I thought the
qualification was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like one of those Hentai where, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you put it on, you always nut to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that was the quote in mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I definitely could not
do all three in mind, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they're not my first choice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So if I were to pick
my actual favorites, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it would be like I have
a really boring list. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - True, that what I'm just trying to say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It would also be ones that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like everyone's probably heard of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or everyone has already watched, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't wanna pick ones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that are like too famous that
like everyone's heard of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's hard because I wanted to pick some, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then the ones that I wanted to pick, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Well, this is kind of sad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's gonna make me look pathetic." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I was like, "Fuck it,
I'll just choose it, fuck it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And which ones did you
actually wanna pick then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If I would have, Masterpiece
would have been on there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a whole fucking series, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> There was some other ones like I think... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What is it like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, it's Joshi Lucky,
that one's pretty good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joshi Lucky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really fucking love that one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's a few other ones
can't remember them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This the problem as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I watched these Hentai, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you think I fucking remember the name, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "No." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I had to go through like
all these Hentai websites- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I wanna see the image? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like fucking all right, I think
this image is a good scene, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then some of them I
would find, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I only like one scene
and the other three scenes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are really Fucked." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like gross. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then there's a few where it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if there has a loli in
it I'm immediately like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "No, I cannot." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I would have recommended like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Makistu Happening", or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but everyone's already seen that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone's watched that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like the summer wars
whenever the on the beach, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with those girls. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Resort Boin"? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh Resort Boin, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was another one
I was gonna (murmurs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're like, I wanted to
recommend "Rance" as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but everyone knows. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone's already seen that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone knows Rance, that's a classic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A lot of mine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> end up being like, just like
wholesome "Vanilla" ones, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just like this this ain't gonna- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Vanilla" has done well,
it's just good man, good shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because like there's plenty
of like good "Vanilla Hentai" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I wanna recommend, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're all just gonna be
sitting here being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yes, this is good shit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, vanilla is also my favorite flavor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Vanilla" has its place goddammit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do also like feeling wholesome </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when I have a wank every now and again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, that is my favorite feeling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What I'm saying is right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah, Vanilla has its place
don't get me wrong but, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, if there's a podcast episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where we talk about ice cream flavors, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna talk about
vanilla for two hours, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So let's get the others
flavors, We'd have flavors, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're not gonna talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about vanilla for two hours,
but you know, I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which is why I'm glad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's when I saw Joey's list, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> his three list was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> your that you picked,
encompassed like half </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of the things I wanted to like recommend. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like I figured out
Joey's tastes pretty quickly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean like I saw
Joey's list and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I know what this guy
wants to talk about it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I wanted to talk
about the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "I'm glad
you picked these ones, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I can pick other weirdo ones." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's gonna be another episode, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like the two boys agreed, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm here like fighting the good fight </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the corner man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we got the Hentai Monopoly man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Steve hand jobs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over here, with his fucking turtleneck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - My God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But yeah, so we're gonna go through... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess we'll go one at a time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a kind of in a rotation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So what do we wanna start off with? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you wanna start off with you Joey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What was my first one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your first one was "Tropical Kiss". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah Tropical Kiss. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This was like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. I'm glad you started
off with this one because, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this like this one
epitomized everything I love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about wholesome "Vanilla Hentai", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's just like, this one
was a good "Vanilla Hentai", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where, what I loved about it is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it had like relationship development. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right absolutely you, that's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll let you finish your point, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll let you finish your point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's the whole reason
why I personally liked it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then you're not gonna lie like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you have that whole buildup </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from like start to
finish, you know, granted. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not like an anime episode
level of buildup, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a generic Hentai episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - In What world was this wholesome. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean? What do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He literally like drunk
fucking raped like that girl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he's like,
"Oh, but no I love you". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, which one is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I actually- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How could you sit there and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah he drunk fucking
took that girl se sindi, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and then decides he loves the girl." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Then you're going to say it's wholesome? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no, no, because
it's wholesome Vanilla, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it has like this
little bit of spice in it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like rape? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, okay, like, that's
like a typical spice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in fucking Hentai. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's be real here, let's be real, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is, it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is like my tag, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is yeah but, what I put this in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is kind of like it really reminded me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of something like like "Rumbling Hearts". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you guys think "Rumbling Hearts", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a really melodramatic anime- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So should we describe what
happens in this Hentai first? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey, I mean you chose it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I thought you're the best on to- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not gonna lie, I
haven't seen in a while- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, maybe one of you boys
should explain how it happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so from what I remember, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there are like two main girls, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And okay, I wasn't- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay so, it starts off, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I remember this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I literally wrote this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "I'm 11 minutes in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and nothing is fucking happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When will something happen?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's typical Hentai(murmurs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's about like they
all work at a resort, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not really told, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then they are working there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like a indoor pool resort. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - We are not told why, all these
six girls want to this guy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because there seems to be
nothing redeemable about him, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> but there's like six or seven girls, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> two of them are identical, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so I was fucking so
confused some of the time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> So I'm like, "Why is there two
pink girls, the exact same? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - But it's like a different tint of pink. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then the first scene
is like her being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, I don't want to
be with you anymore." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And then literally two minutes later, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> after another girl has shown interest, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> she's like, "Wait, I love you." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> can we take it back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And then he reveals he like had drunk sex </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> with the blue head girl. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it was really weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So like the second episode, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember the second or third episode, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I forgot which one it was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is the blue head girl. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This what I hated about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because this episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they build up what is
supposed to be Garnt say's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "A wholesome relationship </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between them and this pink head girl. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hamadi I think the name was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In the back of your head you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> "They've shown a Harriman in Hentai. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, you know, he's
going to have his fill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at every girl here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so how does this story remain wholesome, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when I know the next episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> he's gonna have the same
exact shit with another girl. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is the route, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> this is the one route. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the one route, and also it- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's all in the same universe, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's all the same shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. No, no, it's a different route. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, yes, I mean
it's different route, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but at the same time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a developing story
that something similar to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I said "Rumbling Hearts", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like more recent example </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would be like domestic
girlfriends, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> where they have like relationships, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like he jumps between relationships, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it does add a little bit of like spice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and context to their relationship, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which I appreciate that,
which I appreciate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also, they like speed
run introduce characters, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the first like two minutes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm trying to write... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> I was literally trying to write the down, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I couldn't keep up." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> So then there would be like six
dramatic scenes back to back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that felt like I needed a whole episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before it to understand
what the fuck was going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Wait, wait, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He loves this girl, but
then this other girl, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then there's another girl. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the two hottest girls, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we don't even get an episode with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I watched all of it, right ? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "Fine,
this is pretty deep." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, you watched all three? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I went to, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "You know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's see what the other episodes are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna see if they have the best girls," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the two hot ones, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because those girls weren't that hot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not interested in the loli. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Skip that episode, delete that episode, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> as far as I'm concerned". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The loli only doesn't get fucked though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes she does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, who's the loli? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which one is the loli. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - There is two Lollies, which is two many. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, wait, wait, are
we watching the same show? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, there's the blue head loli. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Blue head? She not a loli. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the fuck she's not a loli. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - She is basically a loli. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - No what are you talking about? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - She looks like 12, come the fuck on. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are you're talking about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Let me get a picture of
this bitch, she looks 12. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You get a picture of this bitch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have never thrown my top hat away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - She is just like the
stereotypical Fucking... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> She is jus a normal girl. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> How is this loli in like your eyes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it because like she has
like average boob size? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your standard of lollies is whack. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why, just because she
has normal sizes tits. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - (murmurs) "Tropical Kiss", right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah but then it was the
brown head one, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Who you don't even see on screen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Brown head one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is this literally
a brown head loli, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> who appears for like fucking three scenes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pixar didn't happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I remember that was one loli, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which was the actual loli in that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and she's like just not
involved in any of the scenes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But my blue head girl is not a loli. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Does she look like a loli men? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no, that's
from the "Visual Novel", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's also not a loli. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, if you look from
the fucking (murmurs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, look, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Moodon, put up a picture of
the blue head girl, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And put a picture of the pink hat girl, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who Connor, is calling loli. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, the pink
haired one isn't a loli, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the brown head girl who was 100% loli. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, brown head girl yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, the Brown head girl
yes, the blue head girl, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is not a loli. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like stereotypical anime girl </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> number fucking five. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - The plot was fucking garbage. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, if I'm gonna watch your porn, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's trying to sell me on plot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I don't appreciate
in the first place, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You better make it good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Skip the story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you better make it good, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Because there are decent
Hentai plots out there, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And this wasn't one of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, we'll talk about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're talking about Connor's ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No because what I liked about this one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> is that, it did have a plot
that I could appreciate, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Appreciate in what sense? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> In what sense could you appreciate it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it felt like it was... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yes it was speed running like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It will speed running basically
of romance drama Anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That was basically this Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also you can't tell me that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the final like fucking speed
run of like sex, isn't hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, yeah, that was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But then as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the same time where there
was speed running, I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yo, slow down, these scenes are great." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're skipping all the best parts man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It like watching a
trailer on browser, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - They give me 11 minutes
of character development, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then a 30 second
compilation of sex scenes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are you for real? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Like what are you trying to do to me here? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the fact is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it had character development. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it's basically
watching something like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Golden Time or something, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Except the characters
actually have sex in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was Love Island with just one male. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, they were just all like
fucking rotating and fucking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then like all the other
girls had no personality. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So wait, you didn't
like the character designs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> or anything? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, the animation was really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah the animation is great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The sex scenes- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was surprised how good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the animation was like,
for 2000 and fucking 12. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I remember, actually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I commented saying like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, the blowjob scene was good." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't like blowjob scenes,
so I thought that was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you actually like review
each sex scene individually? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I didn't even go that far. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - His dick is like blowjob good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I said, "God this is
legit shitty School Days." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because they were like playing up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the drama between two characters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yo, yo, yo, like, let's
not fuck, around School Days </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is a good Hentai. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a bad anime, but it's a good- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a good Hentai. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a good fucking anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I mean, slut knows, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow, was that for radio? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anyway, I mean... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because the thing is, when I
watched the School Day anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it felt like I'm watching a Hentai plot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without the Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So what would it be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I watched the Hentai,
and it's a Hentai? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, it's just a good Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - True. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Another thing that I felt was... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the fuck is the point of this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They all meet in the onset </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to discuss who's gonna fuck him. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like just casually do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you need some
spice, you need drama. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You I need some fucking cat fight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because the girls need
to compete with each other, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and as we know- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But they don't wanna hurt
each other's feelings, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm gonna get shit for this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you not like a little
bit of realism in your porn? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like a little bit of,
Ooh, that could be me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's be honest, five
women who are all polygamous </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and all want to me and are totally okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> with competing for that fact, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I stressed that goes a little
too far on my imagination. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But isn't that the point of
light self inserting media? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah by then like if in my head </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's gotta be like somewhat tangible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like that could maybe happen
in a far away land, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But that like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Come on, come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean like for me with
Hentai, I mean, I would say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, this was like unrealistic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the Harem aspect, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was like unrealistic where,
you know he needed to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with a different girl less
because it was realistic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and more because you're
watching a Hentai, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I guess my mind, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has just gotten used to like shutting off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the unrealistic parts and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "You know, I'm watching Hentai," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's what's hot
when you could be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "That could be me." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but I also have- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "God I wish that was." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I also utilize this
like, my vivid imagination. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I mean, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I closed that part. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I enjoyed the relationship,
like development aspects </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of this Hentai </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I will actually agree with
you where it was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, I do wish there was
like less girls involved. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Put three and let them all like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it was only
three episodes as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And if these motherfuckers knew, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they wanna budget, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they should've done three episodes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with three characters. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> None because they left out the plot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> to the two hottest girls. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah in this type of Hentai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that I would like to recommend, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I reckon like the, the
optimal amount, is two girls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Two girls like having a
gentleman's agreement, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to like have, have like a
relationship with this guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Already unrealistic enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Already unrealistic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can barely get one girl to agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I just like to be spoiled
for choice, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's nothing wrong with that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Go to the fucking brothel Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just like to be spoiled for choice... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the one aspect I like about like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of Harem Hentai is that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We'll get to that
with your second chance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, the thing I
like about Harem Hentai, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is because it's unrealistic, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like I don't have to think like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh that could be me.". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I could just use my imagination. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And also I don't have to
like self insert myself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into Harems, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I Just be like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess will stop there, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And also, you know- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a bit of everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - When it's like five girls
it's way too unrealistic, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then you're also like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "God fucking hell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> How much am I gonna have to
nut to like keep this up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is insane." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean let's be real, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every like Hentai protagonist has like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe when I was like 15, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could it going but now I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Gosh the logistics (murmurs), </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just to keep up with the demand here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like when like Amiibo came out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the fucking supply can not
even come close to it's demand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was gonna say this
during like the second one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you mentioned, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but if we're talking about this already, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "If we're going Harem, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Three is the fucking maximum. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Three is the- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wish we save it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We will save it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> We'll save it for the second one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, like, I mean,
if I would recommend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a nice wholesome, like
Hentai with like the highlight, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that I was going to recommend
if I didn't see, (indistict) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't remember the name, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I might have seen it
and I don't even know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know how to
pronounce this, hold on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - My overall, the review of it that was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would be hotter if there
wasn't four hotter girls in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Six out of 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey, it's still pass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because the scenes, like the
animation was fucking killer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The animation is great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But they skipped over all the best bits. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Read the aggregate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - Because I'm reading
a fucking a porn Joey. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - If I were to recommend a Hentai that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you only want one person, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you have the same kind
of relationship development, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wagaya no Liliana-san, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is the Hentai
that came out recently, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's just pure, wholesome,
like two people meet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is the one with the tongue girl? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, it's the one
with like the dark skin girl, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they go into like a date. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've seen like every recent Hentai. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've probably seen this one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And do you want the top hat? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've watched like every Hentai </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> in the past like three
years that's come out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Damn, and you'd have (murmurs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it's only like fucking what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like five come out like a month </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a center law. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's manageable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's charts and everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> they tell you when they come out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like, I keep up, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right so shall we
go into my first one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your first one was, Shikkoku
no Shaga the Animation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, give it a rate out of 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Give it out of 10 as well Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd probably give it like a seven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll give it a seven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Always decent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And again, it's good,
but it's not my favorite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's go to Garnt's first one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Shikkoku no Shaga the Animation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen this one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've seen this one too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I dig it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So the reason I picked this one is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so this this isn't like
my favorite Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is gonna be a giga video right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's gonna be like, what if Hentai, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is anime, is what it's gonna- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like this one was just... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Firstly, this could easily
be like a fucking shitty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Dororo or something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because this is basically
just Dororo the Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think I wrote, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "It's like if MYZONE wrote Demon Slayer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Basically, but what
impressed me about Hentai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first time I saw it was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how fucking good the animation was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I think we can all
agree that it was beautiful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like this is one of the few Hentai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I watched, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yo, I'm I seeing like some
Hentai Soccer Go right now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like what's going on with
some of these shots here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it's done by a
Studio Seven who did Rant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's done by the same studio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They're really fucking
good with animation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, I don't know... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One thing I really liked about this one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially in like
everything Studio Seven does </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that like, it's yeah, as he said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, the only studio
that can do Hentai Soccer Go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the movement isn't just like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember, the first time I saw like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the final sex scene, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and there was this like
point of view shot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was like super dynamic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like this one like long shot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if you guys remember it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like the fisheye one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah the fisheye one, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> " Damn son, you bring out the budget </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for this animation for this
fucking cum show right man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah it was pretty- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've seen episode only three before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, she's fucking a kid, okay,
I'm not going to watch it.". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why do you always find
yourself in that position man? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, because, he's a kid,
the main character is a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the main character is a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then like, so this
whole Hentai builds up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because them fucking, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, I've gotta wait three episodes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to watch like the half
monster fuck a kid?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, they're all hot monsters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like a monster girl
kind of anime Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The moment she said child
I'm like, "ah, fucking hell." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh jeez it's so gross, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was fine though, I mean, I just... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh God, man, there's
just so much rape in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, "Oh,
inverted boner (murmurs).". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - For me the one scene for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that like kind of made
me go like that was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was during the last one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where she like turns into the spider- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And just fucking bites his head off? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no, before that he's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey, this is an asshole right here.". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tossed his hand In there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was just like what pot? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - His immediate thought
when he sees this woman </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a totally normal woman that
he was just making love to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> turns into half a cockroach spider thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and grows a big sack. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like an abdomen, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then he's first
reaction is to start feasting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm a finna feast this (laughs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's, because he was like
a pussy shaped like abdomen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then he was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, there's only one thing to do now." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I imagine like the
personal clarity after that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would have been monumental, he's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Fuck ,did I just do?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, he had no personal clarity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because then like five seconds
later, he's got head done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I typed out, "LMAO, he
died for the night LMAO.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like pretty much this
entire series everyone dies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the nuts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> After like every sex scene, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone gets eaten by the
monster and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the fuck is that because
I was not paying attention </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to this story, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because obviously I wasn't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently it's based on
like Japanese mythology </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or something, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And for some reason like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this ugly bastards fucking
these women all the time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what up with that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That scene was hot though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? No, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, there wasn't ubi in there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but the girls were hot enough
to like kind of cancel it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, it's like a graph for me, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because this... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like this Hentai, like has the tags </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I don't normally like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but because the animation, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the scenes were just
so well directed and done, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, you know, like this... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I wouldn't normally like this stuff, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but man, you are putting
out too good stuff, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not appreciate that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a build code for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It feels like you're
nutting to a trap, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's trying to get you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's gonna be a Chris Hanson. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 10 seconds, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do you be? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't get it that ugly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I get that's the point, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but why are they so disgusting? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not even that bad of a ubi compared </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to the stuff I've seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is just like
Vanilla ubi, if anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is all it was that ubi- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've seen some ugly fucking bastards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's literally just Johnny
Sins who gained 300 pounds. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that's what that ubi was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like it's like
one of the opening shots, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't, if it's the
first or second scene, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's literally like a woman
being dragged away and raped, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, "Fantastic,
right? Can't can't wait.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm like, "Goddammit God, why?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Although not gonna lie, some of the scenes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I really couldn't focus because, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know who did like
the OST to this Hentai, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but why is it like so good? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like why is the OST so good? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that's the thing like
to me this is the Heantai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with the highest production
values I've probably ever seen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't know why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno why this particular Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not hard enough,
to be like a good Hentai. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's also Hentai so the
story is kind of wasted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah It's like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like imagine if
like they did the Avengers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but with porn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, that's really
ambitious and I appreciate it- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, they definitely have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is which I always come back to it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I always look at this where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Man, I wish every Hentai
just looked this good." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just like, I wish this was more my taste, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I wish like there was
more scenes where I could- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't wish it was good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I don't wanna see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a dude fucking feast someone in 4k. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't want 60 FPS feasting? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm okay, I'm okay with it not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You mean you don't wanna anime milfs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to look at this good? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes anime milfs, but you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because here's the problem
Garnt, with Hentai right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like nine out of
10 ugly bastard rape. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> One out of 10, everything else. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I've had to condition myself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's just like
the best looking ones, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> are the ones like this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's just like the way it's always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the weird shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> or like the ugliest fucking
bastard in the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Here's an idea for developers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> please make a plugin that
goes through Hentai websites, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just blocks out every
Hentai without their (murmurs). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> please, please, I'm begging you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can make that(laughs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Please, I'm so sick of clicking on site </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that has like all the best tags, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then right at the bottom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like mind control, rape,
ugly bastard, for fuck sake! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like yeah, I wanted to
ask you guys this question, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is, can you think of like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are there any like other well animated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> or just high-production
Hentai that you can think of? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe not so like this
level, but like, what are- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Masterpiece. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No fucking (murmurs), </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> masterpieces and even close
to this level of quality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Masterpiece is like 15 FPS off,
what are you talking about? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's amazing, I know why
you call it amazing now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> after the three you gave us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We'll get to there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I can see the level of quality
we have to like compete with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> if you think Masterpiece is actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the best animated Hentai of all time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It ain't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - (murmurs) won't stand for a second. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, you know this Hentai
all had a budget because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it actually had an ending
song, with visuals. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I know it, how the fucking- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It had a really cute ending song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It actually had an ED,
went full fucking ED. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wasn't just like a
scrolling list of names </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that usually... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Oh my God, visuals, what?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like whoever
directed this Hentai, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he was like, "I wanna make an anime." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you wanna know who the director is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's this guy, I
actually looked at this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's this guy called Nisho Katakshi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who used to be a key animator </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like a lot of anime series. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's most well known for
being an episode director </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for Naruto Shippuden. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No joke, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he was an episode director
for one episode of Shippuden. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "You went
from Shippuden to this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I watched this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, "This guy
has anime experience.". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if you watched the
third episode, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> shit's real, where you
you're like 15 minutes in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there ain't a single fuck scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Wait, actually like
well-directed voice acting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with comprehensive plot,
and in ending song?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - "You're definitely from the industry.". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you want that in your porn? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It shows like this in like Rants, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "If I would ever make my own Hentai, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the benchmark." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why would you not want to
push the benchmark of porn? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like it low quality, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I don't feel like shame. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we know, we know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, no, I don't
pick the highest quality. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you mean, you
don't feel the shame? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you feel shame by watching
something that's high quality? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - When it's porn, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When it's too well-produced I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "Fucking luck, I can see everything." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And what's wrong with that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Man, when that dude
shoved his hand in there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, "What led me to be here?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ignore what you're
watching, but we're just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if you imagine like this
quality of production </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on like the shows that you recommended, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on Hentai that you recommend, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would you not wanna see? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I don't want that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why?
- Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want that to be a different... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want my anime and
porn look exactly the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to clear a difference
in quality, always. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The Same reason why like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when they like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know where the high
raise like super Mario 64 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in like unreal engine four, you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> "This is disgusting.". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Put it back to the the bits, I like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't even play fucking Mario games, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what are you all about? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When you see clips of like,
fucking Zelda Ocarina of Time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> in like 144 Hertz 10K, I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> "No, put it back." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I look at that shit and
I'm like,"Hell yeah.". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm like, "Put that shit back.". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That was fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, dude, I don't
want my porn like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I want my porn always a
generation or two behind my anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, speaking of this- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck was that analogy? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sorry, how did you actually compare, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> low quality porn, to making
Super Mario, a HD quality? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What was that analogy,
I'm calling you out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that analogy made no fucking sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because right, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes the animations
junk and I like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it's like, "Thank
you for reminding me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where the fuck I am." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - What are you all about? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't my Hentai to look exactly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and feel exactly the same as anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you like lucid dreaming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while you're watching Hentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Are you awake when you watch Hentai? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do understand what I'm saying? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I watch hand-tight to
keep myself grounded. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, you want a differentiation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> between Hentai and anime? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, I don't understand why, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't want high quality Hentai? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's all I want, I just
want high quality Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I look at something that's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, this happens all
the time with Hentai, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There is like a brand new
one that comes out, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like fresh off of whatever site you're on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you look at the poster
of it, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This looks like it was made in 1982." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And yet you look at it
it's like animated in 2020. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "What? Who? Who? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When I said I wanted to bring
back the '80s anime aesthetic, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't mean it like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I really feel
like it's the inverse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's always like God Tier of cover art, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the new ones and you click on it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and its fucking Queen Bee. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay let's get into you then Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's get onto Connor's
first one, Mother Knows Breast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I did ask (indistinct) don't
fucking read that name aloud, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> without immediate shame. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, I'ma be honest, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen all of the ones you recommend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you serious? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I never seen any of this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have never seen Mother Knows Breast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So Mothers Know Breast, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I saw this name, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like the hugest wave of
nostalgia, like came back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a Golden classic, come on man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, okay, so Mother's Know Breast, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was made by like Studio Milky. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A Studio Milky, you've you seen the logo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if you got into anime in
like the mid two thousands. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because it's, okay... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Shit's hot, man, that's all I'm saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Milky is the Queen Bee,
of last generation, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It is like the lowest quality... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like the only
reason people liked it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was because all of the
Hentai I was uncensored. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is the first time I've ever seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> an Hentai uncensored, and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Shit go back. Please go back." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, "Please go back.". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I could never get over
the details of that dick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and vagina which was
just like singular color. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was just like uniformly one color. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I know, I think I wrote it down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, "Why is that like..."- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You fear for what you don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - The first time I saw it, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, that's like a little different.". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But then as it goes on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess like the animators
just got sick of drawing it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> by the end of it, it just
looks like a desk drawing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because the their genitals looked like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a Ken and Barbie doll, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a strap on foot on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "How does anyone get
off to this in like 2020?". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, well first of all, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really care about like animation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, no shit, no shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - (laughs) As we have already established. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its more about like the story, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like is it the end of the day? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What story? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sorry the scenario sorry, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like the point scenario, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you know how like
you know, it's always like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, well, it's fucking stepmom." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is literally like, OG stepmom Hentai. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it's supposed to be our mom, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you like, I mean,
you read the synopsis, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you get a big like, huh,
because it's not blood related, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so you're like, "All right, nice, nice.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I will say it like I
remember watching this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I was a teenager, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because that was like
Milky like there was Milky </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Pink Pineapple back then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Those were like the two Big Studios. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You chose Milky? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember because, I
was always conflicted, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because Milky had like
the hottest premises. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah premise is hot shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The hottest premises but it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have to like wheel my dick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to like jack off to
this junky ass sexy man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is junk, but it's just
like, it hot, the premise's hot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then like at that point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I might as well just Jack off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to fucking Manga and the Jinshi, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Because at least the odds good and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need something to go with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Little something, something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was nothing in this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Audio and shit, you
know? I need some audio. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I like the repeated moans? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Just like moan moan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> They're on a soundboard,
there were just, "Moan, moan" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, okay, it's been
a while since I watched it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but I mean okay, here also, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why, maybe it's
because I'm a guy, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Rape I'm like, "That's fucked up." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Reverse rape, I'm like, "All
right, now you're talking.". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, get into that but yeah- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know if it's because I'm a guy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and to me, I think it's like
not so much as reverse rape </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is like I'm I see that
character, it's more like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess, like I said like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it's envisioning yourself
in this scenario. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And obviously in my head,
if I'm in that situation, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not gonna be that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We ain't rapists, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get that out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's, just point that out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's get that out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's just like weird
cause I'm conflicted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because I see rape normally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in a lot of Hentai and its
disgusting, but then reverse </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, "Now you're talking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now I'm listening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My ears you know..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it's like, yeah,
like I said, it's mine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what's the one thing I hated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> about this one though? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is the fact that the sister's
name is Oshino Shinobu, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is literally the same name as that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's literally the same name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wish she wasn't such
a little bitch as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - She's so aggravating. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Both of them a little bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And yet she has my wife's name. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm just like, "I'm conflicted.". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just thought, I mean, okay... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean you see all my list, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think all the women
are hot as shit, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We all know, we all know that, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm gonna thrown a
curve ball for this one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I actually ended up watching
the Dub for this one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh shit, I haven't watched the Dub. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - How is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like, okay... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It was surprising, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> BeCause like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is there a dub, I didn't even know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because the reason I
noticed is because like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> every Milky, has a dub. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Every Milky anime, or Hentai
had a dub back in the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was like, it
was surprising to see, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how okay the like, you know the mum, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> was actually pretty good at the job. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But then like the main protagonist </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> was like Sonic the headshot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh gosh, I wish my mum wouldn't fuck me. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Here I comes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it was really jarring here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a really hot older
like mum character, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> have really good live voice acting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there was just like Sonic
the headshot moaning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the background. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is all about this (murmurs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know what it is, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But, if you've thrown
a bath scene in that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like immediately 10 times hotter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The bathroom on set scene, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like 10 times hotter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah not gonna to lie like
when it got to the bath scene, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was when I was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I kind of just lost interest to be honest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's when I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "Now it's getting interesting," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No because... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay the bath scene was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for me, it was just excrutiatingly long. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it felt it went on forever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why I liked it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not to mention, it
was a flashback, anyway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't fucking remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fucking noise,
that the flashback makes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was one scene there already </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like I burst out laughing when I saw it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I got to bear in mind, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't remember the
last time I watched it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, there was a scene, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> where she was like fucking
their stepdad or something, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then these three kids
were just fucking watching- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Oh yeah, yeah, I remember this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And they're all like
engrossed with that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a fucking episode of Pokemon was on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They were just like
watching the entire thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with a fucking smile. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Literally the opening scenes of the anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is that scene, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the kids are just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're just like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's literally
just colon capital D, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that was the face of (murmurs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't understand watching
it as a kid being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What are they doing?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But being like, "Whoa." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the sister was
just like way too happy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just like (gasps). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then like the kid
brother comes in at the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and was just like, "What's going on?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he joins in as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> me and the girls watching my mom have sex, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no biggie, no biggie, just a normal thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Listen I'm not gonna lie
the color on that boy's jeez </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is like worryingly yellow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You know like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's all Milky anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I watched that I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh dude, drink some
milk or something man." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's one of these things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I know that I was gonna
get shit, because I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "It's fucking called Mother
Knows Breasts for fucks sake." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I don't think that's
the worst part of the Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not, there's a
lot of bad things to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But overall, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought it was it was
pretty, you know, I liked it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just said the comments were hilarious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> There was like loads
of comments with like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "That fucking kid doesn't
realize how lucky he is." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You'll look at who wrote
it, like (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean like it's one at like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I look at every Milky anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this one's no different where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally I want Hentai to be uncensored, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with Milky anime, man, I
fucking wish it was censored. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wish I could have see the D- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was a first time where I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "I wish I didn't see the pennis.". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just don't really think about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just so cruelly drawn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want high quality Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You wanna look at the dick? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well that's why it's censored. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah but it's like, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're watching like normal porn, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I hate it when they cut to a
shot of like just the shaft. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm like, "Why are you showing that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like, "What is this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> What is the shot?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd never really thought about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would like to see good details </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like both sides. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You known it's not just the D, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you talked about Hentai
being like too high quality, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> bringing you out of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> If Hentai is a too low quality, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that brings me out it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That could have been roadblocks dick </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and it wouldn't have
changed anything for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it would have been
the same experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I also love, I wrote down here, I said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I love how the guy
contemplates castration instead </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of just saying no to the mom.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that was funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it's like, should
I just like get a castration? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "You can say no, bro.". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just a matter of going, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Excuse me no." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think a lot of people would be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Well, you couldn't have
cut, you know, he's a kid.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I kind of, I don't fucking
know how old he is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, also my favorite line </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the tie first episode is when the mom, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think is like banging the stepdad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and she says, "Bang me so that
my pubic hairs wear out.". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's a real line. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Someone's subtitled. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, this is just like
peak, mid 2000 shitty Hentai. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It has like all the
callings of just like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just very average. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just wish there was a
plot with like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean I would rather have read </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the source material for this,
if there was source material, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I would rather read this
with higher quality arts, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than watch the shitty animation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it wasn't just the
animation they used, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like they use like the
technique back then, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just like using like the
same repeated animations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it just looked like
the sex was taking place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in the deja vu dementia,
you know what I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just like the same two- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the same cut but it's
just zoomed into the face. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then it's like, let's
do like a slow zoom out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to reveal that it's the exact same shot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just liked the mother character, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's just into Milfs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - He's just into Milfs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I am, I am, you got me, you got- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You got me there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, I don't know,
the animation it's alone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just kind of, it wasn't for
me man, it wasn't for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I mean I appreciated this more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I was 17 or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I think it's one of those things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I watched it like
four or five years ago </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like, "Holy shit, this is hot" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like if I watched
it, like back in the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then I would've had a little
bit more appreciation for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think like it's peak
teenager, like do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even then, because back in the day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this had to compete with
shit like Bible Black. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I would rather
watched Bible Black. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you know, most of the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I did fucking watch Bible Black </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was it was like one
of the few times where, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was always the scenario </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that kept me coming back to Milky Hentai, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because God, that animation
was just like such </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an instant softy man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was pretty bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know it's the premise
man, the premise caught me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then fair enough, should
we go onto the second one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> My second one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was it She was at Harem
Time in the Animation? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Harem Time the Animation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you guess what it's about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know exactly why you picked this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've seen this before as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I haven't seen this in
a very, very long time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'm a huge fan of... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I forgot the guy who made it, but like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tosh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tosh.I'm a fan of Tosh's stuff so like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I love the duojin of this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Thank God
they kept the art style." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Because like that's my number one- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So the premise was
that this guy wakes up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and he needs to find an heir. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because he's
like a King or a Lord. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A millionaire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He needs to make an heir, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like typical Hentai I plot 101, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you need to make an heir. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Here are a bunch of females, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can possibly make an heir with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And thee is like two hot ones, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> there's two okay ones, and
there's fucking lollies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like for fuck's sake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then so they all just start fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like, okay, fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's it's a no bullshit one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like straight to the point,. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, it was,, like
I was saying earlier, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when is when is a Harem too much? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because for me anything after three, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is just like, that's when
I think it's too much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know two, is a nice choice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Three is pushing it, four it's
a time management problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You know like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Some days is right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not gonna lie, I struggled to like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, even take care of myself, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what makes you think I would take care </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of five women on top of you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's because
you're trying to look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> at this in a realistic aspect. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so clearly not realistic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Well that's the thing, don't look at it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> as if that's me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just look at it as like there's a dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who's fucking a bunch of girl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not cop joey, I wanted to be me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even care about realism, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what I care about is material. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because when you have a Harem, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can only have like so much screen time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for one girl. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we've all read the Harem d'din Chis, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's like, you're fucking
like five to seven girls, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and every girl gets one page, one page. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> How can I be satisfied with
just one page per girl? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Hey, I'm down to earth
girl with big tits." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Hi, I'm small hell girl with small tits." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and they fit like
three different positions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on like one page, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, "This is
just speed running sex now.". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like there's no foreplay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you just getting straight into it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Again, I like to be spoiled for choice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes, you know,
that's the thing though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, I can always go
back to Harem time and be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "All right, well maybe if I
just wanna focus on one girl, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then I will focus- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Too much it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> You give me like five girls,
give me like one episode. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It needs to be one episode per girl, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then maybe one Harem
episode at the end, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> which I don't give a shit about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it's is all about the
one episode per girl that- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's fair, that's fair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is my structure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I need structure in my Hentai,
and that is the structure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then also when you're
watching a Harem, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> The one thing I hate is like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you know I'm enjoying a
scene a with a particular girl, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it cuts the loli, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, "Well,
there goes it, there goes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why don't you just do now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's all over.". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, because there's not one episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're constantly like having to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "All right, this seems good, go, go, go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's go time." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because you don't wanna
nut actually on the loli, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you find like "Fuck,
FBI is knocking on the door." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just imagine that it's a milf. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just imagine that it's
like a small (murmurs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Your honor I imagined
that it was a milf. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I plead the sixth, which is
imagining that it's a milf." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just imagine you're
watching like this Harem Time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're just like timestamp everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like okay- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll let you download the
episode you cut out loli. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - "15:28 loli scene, skip, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 17:20 nut's here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> on the milf looking character." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I put minus 100 points
for having a loli. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also why was the side plot
better than the main plot? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait what do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like what the fuck was that... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What was this girl- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - With the mom and the sister? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we've the one where it was
the girl that he fell in love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with originally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Rich school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Who eventually joins the Harem, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was better than- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Dude thought
she was hot as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] That scene is hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was one-on-one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you got some character development there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You've got a natural relationship, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then she joins the
Harem and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "It's ruined, it's ruined." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, and then she's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "Ooh, I don't know." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then she's like, "I hate it, right?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When the girl's like
"Oh no, I don't know.", </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and then the moment they start fucking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they start doing like triple
suplex fuck positions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's like, "What are
you... What the fuck.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, "JK, I have
read the Kamasutra.". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - She like fucking
throwing him over his head, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, what the fuck is happening? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I just love when she was
like, "Ooh, I don't know." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And the other girl are just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Aha, let's see about that." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he just starts stripping her. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its so done (laughs). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just not like
ramming her into them, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's whoa, whoa. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, but like, I'm
guessing you pick this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, have you seen the... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Were you like more of a
fan of the source material, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or were you more of a fan
of the actual adaptation? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you fucking love Harems? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do, I do. Like Harems. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, I saw these two shows, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Is Joey a Harem guy?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like my Harems but lay low. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've always, even with like the non-Hentai </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Dojo and like Mango
and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It just feels like ADHD porn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I can't focus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "What's going on here?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like to be spoiled for choice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not about being spoiled for choice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's about having like a
sufficient amount of time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to get invested in one girl, and enjoy- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If I want it to be invested in one girl </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I would read a romance story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Come off it. No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I don't read the Harem to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yes I'm gonna care about this one girl </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and one girl only." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That completely goes against Harems. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I wanna care about one girl... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I wanted to pick it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "All right, I want this girl
to get with the main guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and have this like beautiful
romantic relationship, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all this character development,
I'd read a romance maga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what that's for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A Harem is not... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're not supposed to read a Harem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to fucking get invested in one girl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I disagree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even in Harem Manga, they pick a girl- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - The whole point of this Harem, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> was to choose one of them
to fucking have the child. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - There is a winning girl, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's a reason we
fight over the best girl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's because the best gauche... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We only one, one girl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not all Harems though have a best girl. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also I'm not gonna... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like for me, do you think the Harem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like kind of spoiled, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when they're all just in on it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like happy with the situation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like it, when they're like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I like it when they're
fighting for each other. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There needs to be some fucking spice, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> if everyone's like happy- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah it's bullshit man, come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The best part is like
half the danger, man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why School Days
was semi-good at times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yo you got to get this chip
dick chopped off (indistinct)." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I like to play games in easy mode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like my Vanilla, but Vanilla Harems </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is just like, that's too easy modes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's why I don't
read Vanilla Harems. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I need some spice in there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like saying, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah I'm a gamer," and
go play Cookie Clicker. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like, what are you doing? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This is like the easiest fucking mode. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I hate it, Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It was boring, and it wasted my time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, look at least I
can say there is better anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than fucking Mother Knows Breast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is a masterpiece of storytelling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I like to pick that as kind
of a troll a little bit- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do wanna mention Tosh again though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I feel like that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the reason you picked this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Because Tosh is like this
legendary doujinshi artist, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who went on to make (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was the artist for that, wasn't he? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like, I remember watching this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I remember I've never
seen Harem Time before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But they fucking look like (murmurs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, that's the reason why, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's the same artist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember because I've never watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this actual anime before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the doujin is gods here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, I fucking hate Harem doujins, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like, his art carries this so much, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was really weird
watching this adaptation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it was... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It just reminded me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why I want high quality Hentai
adaptations because like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not gonna lie the animation
wasn't that great, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, it's pretty doujin. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did you also like, like all the girls? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because when I turn the Hentai
on immediately I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "These two girls are the ones I like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or one of the girls." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I immediately singled out- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, yeah, I definitely
have like favorites, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that's for sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, I don't really like to watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or read Harems if there's
like a single girl, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just cannot stand, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that's the reason why, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't like Infinite
Straddles for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there was that one girl </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who i just couldn't stand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that just completely ruined
all the other girls for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Whereas like with Harem Time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, I dunno, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think that deeply when
it comes to Hentai though, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like, I'm not gonna be like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now you're playing in (murmurs). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not gonna like sit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> add like a bunch of like
fucking goals in Hentai Harem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and be like, "Yes, I
don't like the personality </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of this one girl therefore,
completely ruined." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, that's not what I've read Tosh for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I read Tosh because
these girls are hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like his art is God Tier- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not God Tier. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Seriously, you look
like for like the art </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and the animation more
than like the premise or- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I look for both, I look for both. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I definitely look for art though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why it's so hard for
me to find my perfect Hentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it's so hard to find both. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, what I would say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is watching this kind of reminded me why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I'm gonna make like
a blanket statement where, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think there's a Hentai adaptation, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is better than the source material. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I agree with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And there's a reason for this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Although I haven't read
Mothers Breast yet so- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - (indistinct) none of us
have read Mother Knows Breast, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that even source with you for that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> If there is, I don't wanna read it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You wanna know Mother Knows Breast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't you just stick fears. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like mother. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, (murmurs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Serious, when I busted a nut to that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that was one of those
ones where you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh fuck," and you look
at it and you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Jesus Christ what have I done." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This like post nut regret- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jesus Christ, I'll go in the bookmarks, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Fuck Conny, you're disgusting." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's the ones where you like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you've been trying to pick
the perfect show for like ages </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're like, "I guess
it'll be this one today." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've spent half an hour
trying to pick up perfect one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to nut to, I guess this one we'll do this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, this will have to do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, but not because
like there are plenty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of like these fucking
amazing doujinshi artists, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where someone like Tosh, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who is so good that he
is now just a straight up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just a Manga artist, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but the problem with Hentai
I adaptations is that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> no matter how good the source material is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because as we've established
source material can be good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if not better, like than actual Manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But the problem is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no matter how good the source material is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the adaptation and the animation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> will always be subpar slash mediocre. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like if every anime adaptation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just like done by
JC staff second team, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there is no Ufotable or Bones of Hentai, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you just like, even like Pink Pineapple, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like some of the best that they can do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is still like B to C tier. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pink Pineapple is just
an A1 Hentai, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But you're obviously gonna
lose some of the detail </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> when you do it in animation, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It can't be one for one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like I said- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would gladly like
drop 50% of the quality, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if it means it's moving. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I am fucking sick... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah that's because you
can't get off the doujin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why the fuck would I wanna
physically turn a page? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Read any thing by Tosh,
and you'll change your mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I'm gonna continue
this conversation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when we get to your all next pick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's when I actually pick
my last one, (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> my last one I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's your Queen Bee pick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Should we just skip it to you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that my second or my third? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm pretty sure- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the third. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so here here's our
new kind of hot shit taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> He picks one Milky Studio adaptation, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and two Queen Bee anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are they both Queen Bee? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Both of them were Queen Bee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Listen, I am Happy to clown on Queen Bee </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and the animation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why the do they get
all the good stories? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's pissing me off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why they're Milky
of this generation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can totally be like, I'm so fat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I hate you so much, but
Goddammit you are good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But Pink pineapples the opposite, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a great animation,
but that's shit premise. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that like, for some reason, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some dude who has all the good plots, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they have like a round
table somewhere in Tokyo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and they like decide the best
plot like some NBA draft, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and they give it to the worst studios. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, "Which one would
you like to star Queen Bee, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And he just like, "No, I'll take these." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hate it so much, but
I can't stop watching it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because the premise I just so damn good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like when I say Queen Bee, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No I hate it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a name flashbacks, isn't? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If Soft On Demand
wasn't already a company, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> that should be like Queen Bee Animation, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> like animation company named Mac, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because, it is Soft On Demand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I see like they're fucking worthless. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So, the second Hentai you recommended was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Houkago no Yuutousei. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can not tell me
this is shit, fuck off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> This premise is a fucking banger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've read the original source material, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I fucking hate it that Queen Bee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got this source materials, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because Queen Bee get
the best source material. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm basically getting
the doujin with extra steps </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> when it's animated by Queen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah because the
problem was Queen Bee, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that they are premium Hentai clickbait. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because they have like the best steals, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you see the thumbnail
as you're scrolling down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like, "Yo, this looks hot." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you see them moving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just like instant Softy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's literally just
like them taking the doujin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and doing this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It sucks, I hate it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like they learns how to use like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the warp tool in Photoshop, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and also like the Vegas
like key framing tool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And those are like the two
tools they know how to use. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I will not lie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it does sometimes put me off
when I see a blatant shitty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> key frame. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's annoying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But, damn if they're
plotting good man, Goddam. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Goddamn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the Hentai design is fucking hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So should I explain the
plot as I remember it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Correct me if I get anything wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Basically it's two girls, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> you know, Snot too many to keep track of. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's summer break
clash not summer break, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> something like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And the dad is never at home conveniently. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And they fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And one of the girls is like super horny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and always wants to fuck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and one of the girls just wants to watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for some reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't get that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then the shy girl
kind of like gets us like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Ooh, I'm I'm interested in sex now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, and then
the shy girl is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hell yeah, dude." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The shy girl hotis hot as fuck dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they just start, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's very... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They don't miss. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Expect the end where
they like run off together. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> That was weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "Whoa, Whoa,
Whoa, come on (murmurs). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - The thing I noticed about all the stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is it's basically just
live action porn, animated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just your typical
fucking porn hub video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but except it's Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But the thing that's right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that when it's like on Porn Hub, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> these people look weird or
disgusting half the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I don't wanna ride on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's nice seeing like
you know, just fucking like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, just normal people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's nice not seeing an
ugly bastard just say it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's nice not seeing... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's nice seeing someone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who I could be like,
"That's could be me.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I was a lucky mother fucker. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, and like, you're watching it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, also it's got
everything that I like man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> straight up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, and you know, public
sex is hot in shows, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's dangerous, man, got
the little danger going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you saying that
through experience or? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I don't comment on
those kinds of things Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's also... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like what is the one
that came out recently? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The Saki based woman. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Saki best (indistinct), </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is why I'm surprised
you didn't record that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't pick that because I thought. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was by a good animation studio. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't pick that because
I thought that was too easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's too high quality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I thought too easy that's
what we would agree on it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because the thing
is, I actually noticed- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That is a better version. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I actually wrote this down, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is like why did Connor
not pick Stackable Date Live? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is by the same author, and artist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they're both by the same artists. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is like Amazing, that's got you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's up there to me,
with like Masterpiece. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That is better than Masterpiece, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because that's good animation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We will agree to disagree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the point was is that, dude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the scene in that,
was it Succubus Stayed Life? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Succubus Stayed Life, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that fucking scene when
they fuck in the hallway, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's hot as shit dude, is it not? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because you are like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Yo, we got like 30
seconds to wrap this up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's do it." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's hot as shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - The quickest nut in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what's hot about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Manx's like, "Yo the danger." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know they're not gonna get caught but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It could be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like what I love about
a lot of the character designs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that Queen Bee happened to choose, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that all the girls, they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have a bit of meat on them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You see like a lot
of anime girl designs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially in Hentai, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's just like typical
here I am anorexic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna a little chunk to them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's rare that you get to see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> any like meat anyway, stuff
like breasts, in fucking Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I also appreciate how,
almost 99% of the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they do maintain the original artists. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's probably the problem, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You saying I have good taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is what I literally scene for scene, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but just with a little bit
of whopping that's all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So good tastes... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is a good one, come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, this is a good one but- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you not entertained? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no, it was good until you chose </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Mother Knows Breasts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a good one because the
source material is fantastic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - The source material was gorgeous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The source material was fantastic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Queen Bee, hell no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Hell no man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Get that shit out of here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like are you putting the, the animation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and all of that above? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is as important as important? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't get the importance. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> If animation isn't as important, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than why am I not reading the doujinshi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> If I cared about animation, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would just watch real life porn, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because that shit, that's
one-to-one perfect animation, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know real life porn
and Hentai are nothing alike. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - The Hentai right where there's no plot </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> or no story or no like fucking premise. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just it's animation (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's like saying I would rather watch </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> the live action adaptation of an anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rather than the anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Here is what I understand, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> if you don't care about
animation quality in your Hentai- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then why do you not read doujins. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't wanna fucking turn a page. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I draw the line having
to move one of my limbs, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> beyond what I'm already doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're already moving one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't wanna have to go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> "Ooh, next page." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm a fast reader as well Joey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, okay, What about
try it on your phone? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because you have the hands free. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why don't you flick? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, do you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is awful, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, you've had
to watch on your phone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've got to make it do it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate it, when you get
a message from someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> when it's like you've got it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's like, Joey's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Yo, Connor what are you up to?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm like, "For fuck." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> We gonna restart this progress bar now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Fucking help. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It puts me off. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So that's why I Chromecast it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm just gonna message
you every hour now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Just hoping that I'll catch you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why, that's why
I Chromecast it to my TV. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> So I don't have to... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> You don't get a big
notification from like Duolingo, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Hey, why are fucking masturbating?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, wait, you watch it on
your like fucking widescreen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in your living room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, not living room, bedroom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna be in bed, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna you know, come
on man, I wanna be cozy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I can't do it sitting up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like I don't know why, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't do it... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I've only done it
sitting up basically. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Really? Oh my God. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You do it lying down? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dude that's a fucking mess, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Get tissues, what the fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, I can do
in any position anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Standing up, sitting down, lying down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Obviously you know, it's... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, I just wanna be comfortable, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna be at optimal comfort. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I get that, I get that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's hard to like fucking
like look at the same time- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pillows man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I'm in a hospital. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I'm in a hospital bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just sit up then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have like the optimal
gamer set up of jacking off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you can't just like
use your second hand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to hold a phone, are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no, because the screen
is so fucking small man- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude VR porn was invented for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe if one day, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> There's a way where I
can do like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> big screen? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You need like a fucking- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Google next page. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Swipe. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, if I made like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a fucking PowerPoint presentation for you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> if I converted doujinshi </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to PowerPoint presentations for you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which you can Chromecast, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you can be like next page, next page. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Would you be able to Jack off to that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Would you do that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, maybe, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Probably actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I could actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So wait, it's not even the matter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of the fact that it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's on paper and it has
words that you have to read, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just the fact that you're too lazy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to turn a fucking page? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's what gets you soft? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's I don't like holding my phone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I text on my phone all the time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't like looking at
the porn on my phone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna be honest with you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna make a game of set up for you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just for jacking off, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the same reason why like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if you've ever been like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure it's happened
at some point, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe you're in relationship </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they've offered to
send you a nude picture, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't wanna look at
that shit on my phone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like what do you look at it on then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just don't wanna look at it at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is there a story going on here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why are you sending me this shit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's the reason... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You when someone sends
a nude or something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, you've been
in a relationship once, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure you sent one, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't watch the still image on my phone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why should you to stare at it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? So you want them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to send a synopsis along with the photo? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, I don't wanna anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't send anything, I'll do it myself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I have methods. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I have the entire websites
that I can Chromecast </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> to my bedroom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well in that case the
video is always better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But, like what I'm
saying is that you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> even if it's a- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - A doujin, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you play it on like
a PowerPoint, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's say it changes
page every five seconds, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that's fine, I can deal with that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So if I made one for you, would you do it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I'll do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - So you basically just need
like a hands free version </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of doujinshi, and you'll be okay? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pretty much yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why don't you like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I wonder if we could like
fucking connect it to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the Alexa. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Alexa, next page." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe I can wear a HTC
Vive while I'm doing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The VR Porn was made
for people like you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, no, no
because I always say like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the big advantages
of the doujinshi, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that you can go your own pace. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you know, you have
certain scenes in an anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> When you're just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "Man this blowjob scene
is taking too long." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> As you, as you've already said. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Well you just don't wanna
get involved and be buffering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's, like every time there's
an uninteresting scene. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is normally like, why you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you just kind of guess you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "All right I reckon it
will be the scene here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it'll get good in about
30 seconds or a minute. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'll just skip to that,
and I'll be like, "Go ahead.". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And if it's really taking the piss, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's going on for a good five minutes, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm like, "Well fuck come on, (murmurs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I'll go up and I'll
reluctantly, get out my phone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "All right, still going,
still going, and we're done." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I like about
doujins that like, as you said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can go at your own pace. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So if there's like a scene
that's like really hot, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can take your time, take your time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can look at the all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the fucking finest details, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - puts it on the like, mic
like damn fuck that's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude I fucking framed
that shit, I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Damn, that's a piece of art right there." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just lazy, I think
that's, what's the problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we figured. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, you say you're lazy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you go into like extra steps, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in order to fucking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Chromecast it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - In order to Chromecast it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and be like, I don't know how
to, how can I describe it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have to use it like an
ExpressVPN, thank you, shout out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when they sponsor us, I use that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I have to
like, get a separate app </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to Chrome cast videos
that can't be Chromecast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's a big- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would you bother. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I don't wanna
watch it on my phone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I really hate watching
stuff on my phone like that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, it really
is like, it bothers me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You say you're lazy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but this is like the opposite of lazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is putting in... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> This putting in extra steps
just to enjoy some fucking porn. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, I get it, but it's like... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> To me, it's like the Winnie the Pooh me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> like Garnt is the normal Winnie the Pooh, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and I'm the Winnie the Pooh that's like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> "Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah, let's Chromecast it." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> Garnt's like, "Huh, huh,
picture, huh, huh, slow.", </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you know like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Watch your watch on PC monitor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> watch on Chromecast. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hands free, free Chromecast. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I got to say like, you got balls, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to like press the Chromecast button. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's just like the sign of someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who's obviously living alone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause I imagine like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I used to do it when
I had roommates as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and we had two- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This man is living on the edge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I was confident, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because there's like a five
second buffer for Chromecast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I knew- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You have a five second
window, to like back of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I knew if it wasn't
buffering immediately, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Abort mission." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Chromecasting Hentai. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Listen it's the future. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you were at your parents' house, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would you dare press
that Chromecast button? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - If it was in my room, 100%. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because, my house, in
my like my parents' house, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I have too many Chromecasts. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like, it's a danger
wank at that point, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're playing a dangerous game there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are they all called TV one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - All it takes is one misclick, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All it takes is one slip of the thumb. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like diffusing bomber,
you cut the wrong wire, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just fucked, alright? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Listen let's say it happened, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm fine, I can go and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Mom, come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Come on, mom. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What I am supposed to do mom?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What if your mom
comes up just being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Queen Bee really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> That's all, I'm more disappointed about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Just like Owen watches Pink Pineapple." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "My favorite child
watches Pink Pineapple." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - I accidentally Chromecast,
Mother knows Breasts, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to your mother's TV. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just like Milky, really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Fucking Milky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - "I didn't raise you
for fucking 23 years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just so you can watch Milky." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Listen, we're getting off topic, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the point was right, is that the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Premise 10 out of 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Premise is hot, ruined by Queen Bee, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> read the original version. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You couldn't jack off to that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what I did actually, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after I sold that and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, this is this one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I actually went and read the doujin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, because for me, if
the animation is good enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I can get it better now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'ma get it better now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, you wouldn't touch that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I would find something better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, Oh, my friend
recommended me to 40P porn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I could, if I tried, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I know two clicks
away, there is 720 more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When I was like 14, I had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to make it do with 144P when I could men. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're a grown adult,
make your own choices now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I streamed that Queen
Bee 1080P to my Chromecast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We you can choose much better Hentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would literally rather
not to suck you for state life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the 10 millionth time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than nut to that once. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can't wire it out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't re-watch the
same one too many times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because otherwise you get
too familiar with it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you don't want to be that- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, that's the thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I would rather be familiar with it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and be worn out with it
because I would rather do that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> than have no standards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No standard, come on man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Buts that's why I like
reading doujins, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it updates way more
frequently than Hentai does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm always like constantly
looking for the next thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that's why I never
get it familiar enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> with the series. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, how many
doujins are you reading? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How often are you reading doujins. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a few times a week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fucking hell Joey, Jesus. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, you know
sometimes I'm just bored </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, "I wonder
what's new, on FAKKU. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna keep up to date with the industry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I got too much thirst for it, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have my fill, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I do it and I'm like,
"all right, I'm fine.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like talking to you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like fucking the act of rubbing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when now it's like a
quick time event for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, I have designated
I have this 15 minutes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I must match X for these 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, back to normal life now". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Because you know, to me
it's like jacking off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is entirely different to like sex, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and how that feels, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's totally different world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because one of them, I
don't need to, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the one it's like,
"All right, I like this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll take my time with it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the way I see it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So I don't really give a shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fair enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fair enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's go on to Garnts second one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnts second one was a
(speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm gonna say it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I busted a nut to this one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> This one was great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> This one was fantastic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, so usually to
explain why I pick this one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Usually I'm like a very much
a Vanilla guy, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> too happy, you know, loving couples. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But this one was the one Hentai </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that made me realize "Man,
maybe crazy girls are hot, man." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, look, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the moment I saw this, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Of course Garnt got into this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because this goes literally one step away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from every one of Garnts
favorites Tinder character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> This is one step above
it's Tinder the character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, because you talked
about reverse rape earlier, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and like, I feel like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This wasn't reverse rape. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is what this was
like reverse mind break. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It started off as blackmail, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but then it just ended up (murmurs). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It just ended up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as just like standard like S and M, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was hot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah it was hot but I dunno, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just not really into like the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Although I did have a kind
of like chopped out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for a moment they were talking
like, "Who took that...:" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So the premise that like she asks him out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the guy says, "No.". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But for some reason she
has the guy's phone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And on this phone is a picture of him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in BDSM outfit, I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then she's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh if you don't want me
to send this to everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in the school, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you need to come,"- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Come back to my house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously right,. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so it's like, "Oh, okay." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then halfway through
when they're fucking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> she's like, "Oh, who took this picture?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was, you know, I
was having a great time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She goes, "Oh, my sister
took it, my little sister." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Whoa." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I completely for got about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then it's isn't brought up again. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he's like "Your sister took it?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's like, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And she like, "All
right, keep fucking me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's like are
going to touch (laughs). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then he's like, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she doesn't want anything
sexual out of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Press X to download.". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you sure about that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think she does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I saw in episode
two with a different girl </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm always like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, I'm gonna guess
that's the little sister." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I mean, unfortunately
this is just like a one shot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that episode two is a
completely different girl, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> completely different guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's one of those ones where this is like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - God I hate that so much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah because
I wanted more of this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanted more of this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was very disappointed that
we didn't get more of this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> The thing about this is that for me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this one was all premise. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I didn't even think
the girl looked that hot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was some frames where
she looked fucking (murmurs). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The animation was subpar a C list. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The animation was subpar, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the character designs were fucking shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a CDI game at some point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like there was one or
two frames and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Fuck, we are not having a face." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Holy shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I also just like one scene, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that I just couldn't get over, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when he's like first, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like, you know, just
kind of like doing scissor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like sitting on his knees, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "All right, jack off." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "How the do you jack off,
while sitting on your knees.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like "Can I at least put
my knees down?", Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like my legs would be fucked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I wouldn't be able
to concentrate(laughs). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And he does it in like 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Your legs dead bro." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like there's no way I'll
be able to keep a bonner, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because what I liked about this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was that it didn't immediately
just go to the fucking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> There was so much build up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was one of the Hentai where I'm, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Man normally, you just
wanna skip straight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the fucking.". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But this one made the payoff worth it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what made this, like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is what a good plot in Hentai can be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have enough buildup that you need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without it being boring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's because like the S and M </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like side of things,
kind of made like a nice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like, twist on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It wasn't just like standard boy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and standard girl, were talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it gets to the fucking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, there is a
little spice to it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like the right
amount of spice to it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> without being too over the top. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, also, why is it like when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's rape Hentai it's like
full on like Jesus Christ, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like disgusting. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But then when it's reverse
rape, it's always like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> "Well, I guess you should fuck me." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think you just
really like reverse rape. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do, but it's never
actually like the way, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like, it's nowhere near like the reverse </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> of what the rape is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah , yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's always like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's always suggestive, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like this one, like, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the guy could have left at any time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and she said that the guy could left </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and she gave him his phone back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He could've left, that wasn't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But he wasn't going to
cause he's a Mascus, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> That was the whole premise of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was weirdly realistic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why we need to
correct the reverse rape tag. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It should be reverse
suggesting fuck me please. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Reverse, suggested blackmail rape. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean I liked it, it
was good, it was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> It was the first time I saw a in Hentai, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that one of us went like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, very rarely, where
I was like, "That's hot.". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Then you really know how
to cap your thing with, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> "Nice, nice. I like that.". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm realizing from this
fucking conversation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you like you're fucking milfs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You like your Harems, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need my spice, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like spice what do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No I like my spice, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Would you define a spice? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Define spice Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so like, aside from Vanilla, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> which we can all agree, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> always great top tier. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Always solid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Always a solid, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like, I don't want just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the normal kind of relationship. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> There always needs to
be like a twist to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like what I like is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially if it's like a relationship </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they know they shouldn't fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like hot to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, those are hot, those are hot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Danger fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You like danger fucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You like flaming like
tire mountain fox, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This was burning down to the ground, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but, I'm enjoying while it burns. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it why step-mom porn is so popular, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's supposed
to be like forbidden? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes like taboo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, right? But, you
know, I think that's why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it is so popular, because it's like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, we I shouldn't be this.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well it's like step-mom porn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like incest porn as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like, you know, even in the premise, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not I guess tactically incest, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just really uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm surprised aside from
like Mothers Knows Breasts, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there is none of us recommended like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any like brother or sister Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's because brother
and sisters is like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> For some reason, stepmom
and kid is like, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But brother and sisters, like, Oh! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also this is like way too much, bro- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm the opposite, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but that's probably
because I'm an only child. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> So I'm just like, "Brother
and sister, yeah. Mom, oh!" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> That's a bit too fucking realistic, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> get that out of my Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the immediate
assumption is like anyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> who likes like step-mom is like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean you wanna fuck your mom 100%. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like no, no, not at fucking all, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's the opposite I just don't know why. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Because it's like, what is more </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> forbidden than doing that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like the most
illegal you can get whilst </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> being legal, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> That's what it is, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> By every single measurable
thing, it is fucked up and wrong, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but not really (laughs). </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not really. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It only just gets more
morally wrong, right> </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The only thing worse
than fucking a step-mom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is a stepdad, right? So? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's fucked, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's like, because it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the way I judge it is that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it's the kind of porn that
you can't really like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a scenario that if you,
let's say you had sex </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with your stepdad, there
is (murmurs) you can go. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know, so guys,
totally legal by the way. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If I did sleep with my stepmom, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone would be, "Yeah, yeah.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, question to you then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If Mothers Know Breast, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was like, if the mum,
was a blood-related mum, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> would yous till be able to nut to that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Too realistic? Too realistic? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's too... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I have a mom. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But step-mom, never had
that, can't experience that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you know I mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not that I would want that anyway, but? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, well, what
was the other one with... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> There's another Hentai where like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like a Russian mom comes... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, it's like a
Russian blonde woman comes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in a like 20 year old high school Neat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like four episodes
where they're like fuck </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and do shit and it's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the same shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Same shit... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Honestly the same shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like the guy's like super into it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the same thing but this
time the mom is Russian. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, it's like for
some reason it's weird, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I get it monkey brain, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about like story and video games, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> not premise and porn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Yes please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because the thing
is like a lot of the Hentai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I enjoy, is like I said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the ones with spice in there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it just happens that a lot of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just happened to have
step incest in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it had like, what I hate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is when it's just like
the fucking incest Hentai, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when the brother and the
sister, they wanna fuck, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, that's like that's
like a big turn off for me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like the ones
that make you like stand up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and go like, "Ah! Fuck! Ah! God!". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The, hard tap a bit, the hard tap. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - One is the fucking Oniichan Hentai, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know the one's I mean,
the Oniichan Hentai's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like incest softy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> get the out of my face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So many people into that though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think Overflow, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Is like one of the most
popular Hentai's this year? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's top three, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that is just all brother and sister, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like I watched it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I was like, "It's number three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, surely the critics know
their stuff, right? Surely?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> First episode, like brother in the bath </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> then sister comes in the bath,
okay, all right, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Just accidentally inserts, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like, for fuck
sake, what do they expect? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What do you expect? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - How would you accidentally insert? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How does that happen? (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you can accidentally insert, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what was the fucking short form for like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Hentai that you're gonna put on the list? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I can't remember the name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like the Girl Falling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> from the second Floor or something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Girl Falling from the Second Floor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The reason I watched that one was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's like a full season one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And this was a Hentai
that somehow ended up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on fucking anti-chat in anime list. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, there's there's
sometimes like Overflow, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that was like a seasonal anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that ended up on my anime list. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> For some reason, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because it's like five minute episodes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's like a full season. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> So the full season like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For the porn? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but it's porn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I don't know how it ends
up on seasonal anime lists. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - There are your spicies reviews. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So yeah, I can't remember the name, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so should I fucking name
like Google the name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, if you know what it was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but basically the premise is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a guy who's living in like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a really old like rickety apartment, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like kind of falling apart. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's a girl that
lives right above him, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a really hot girl. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the girl was like doing dance practice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever the it was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and because the apartment
is so rickety and old, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she falls through the
second floor, like thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and goes down to the guy
where the guy's sleeping, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she lands, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on his dick, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and inserts, and I'm like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And you can also see that her underwear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has somehow shifted. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Which for one, the fucking physics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that goes into this one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> For one, because he must've like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just had a permanent stiffy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - At the correct angle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - At the correct... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like a fucking angle,
perfect frame, perfect fall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "So we're gonna do the second full clip, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the penis needs to be angle perfect, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the fall needs to be frame perfect, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the landing to go smoothly.". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the reason, the reason
I find it so hilarious, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was because it was on
a seasonal anime-chart, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and it got fan-subbed, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and whoever was fan-subbing this- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That guy was funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Whoever was fan subbing
this, was obviously not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like taking this seriously. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because he was technically
still translating it but, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the fucking phrasing that he used was- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's literally a
frame where the girl says, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Shoot your guru, my dude." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, "This is fucking awesome.". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was very good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I just wanted
to bring that one out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I thought it
was fucking hilarious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, like titles on screen now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't find it now, well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll, I'll send the title to (murmurs). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they're the only
thing that was like weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about the one that you chose Garnt, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was that she just at one point was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, just rape my ass, just do it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was like, I was like, "What?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And he didn't, what a
classy man, first of all. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I was like, "Why does she say that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What a fucking weird thing to say." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like where did the sadism go? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I liked that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it was just like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Not, not the fact that she said that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but the fact that it was like,
the scenario was progressing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You didn't just have one, like one- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was a cliffhanger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You didn't, just have like one scenario. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It had fucking development in there, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I give it a nine out of 10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like , yeah, it was good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I give it like a 7
or a 9, it was pretty good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's Something I'll come
back to you in a year, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and be like, "Nice." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can watch the second episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right, so we go to
Joey's last pick then I guess, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When I saw Joey recommends one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanted to like high five the dude man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can high five me right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so Joe recommended Kudo You Know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is, shall I call it
like famous or infamous? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Definitely infamous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, I knew that probably
Garnt had seen it before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I just wanted to see
what Connor would say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was vile. It was fucking disgusting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I pardoned. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> There's never an English
language to convey </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what you made me sit through. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What the fuck, have you nutted to that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is an experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why do these (murmurs)? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, I don't know what the
purpose this whole show is? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Go explain that though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I feel like the premise is that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there is a kingdom, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They've made a kingdom, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> where they've separated
like girls from guys, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and girls like kind of live </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> in this kind of high class
posh kind of kingdom, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then there are the boys, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who are just like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The boys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The boys, who were just like
the dirt bag of the world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's basically... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The main mercenary leader,
he's just fucking guts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's just gut's, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The man wasn't? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is the Hentai adaptation of Berserk, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with even more rape. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like if you take Berserk, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> remove all the cool parts,
and you just keep the rape. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, pretty much, pretty much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I saw the tags, and I was like, "Fuck." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not gonna lie I
only chose this one purely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get a reaction out of Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I knew Garnt, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> watched it, and Garnt likes it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So like the premise is
the guys try to invade </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the kingdoms like that the girls build, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and of course they invaded it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like a dark fantasy middle- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So the first episode
they invade like the elves, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're all ten. Which is
like immediately hot for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They invade the elf kingdom and, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just like and... They
just fucking gang bang </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the shit out of these elves, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For some reason, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> So he, he wants to sleep
with this woman, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Why does he let the Orks fuck her? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What's up with that him? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Why the Orks fucking him? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Because, there's Orks there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also why the Orks are
listening to this guy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like why are Orks there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because the Orks wanna to get some. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then also, why did
the Orks, have human dick? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know does that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, because it's a Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> No, no, no, they do not
have fucking human dicks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - They had giant human dicks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I paused it on one of the frames, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because I had to take like a fucking- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is not a human dick, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that is a fucking horse cock right there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was drawn completely- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - The girlfriend. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm not arguing with the gut size now, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> but the dick was a human dick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The gut from that Dick
was just like as wide </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as the woman's waist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Because what happens is right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I had to pause it at one moment. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I was just like
one, this is disgusting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had to post many times to be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just stand up and go like
just light a cigarette. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even smoke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just light a cigarette. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But there was this one
scene and I remember it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause I was like full Orks and I paused </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there was like four Orks
standing around each other, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> right? Like this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And the dicks were blue. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But you could clearly see
they were normal human dicks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, totally. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I was just like, why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is so weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why wouldn't have Orks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> dick shapes she'd have
gross, ugly Orks man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, but no one wants to see that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Does anyone want to see this anyway? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What are talking about? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've added ugly bastard
with an extra faction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's fucking Orks,
they just ugly bastards </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the dick, that's like an
extra guthy, ugly bastard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I refuse to believe people
like watching Orks fuck people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well then why is there so much of it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why? Who are these people? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The reason why there's so much, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is because there's lots of
people who wanna watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why? Why, would you wanna
watch it, are you okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can ask that question
about milfs as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why would you wanna watch it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, come on, are you really
comparing milfs to Orks? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Are you really comparing
milfs to Orks, Joey? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because what I will say
about Kudo You Know, is that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is every tag, that I detest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's, let's be honest, let's be honest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Orks are just ugly
bastards but just square. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With attitude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There just ugly bastards,
but just even uglier, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with a different skin tone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like I normally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember first watching Kudo You Know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Why would I fucking want to watch this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But what it does, it's that this Hentai, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> is so ridiculous, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and so over the top, that it just, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like, you know, that meme, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> not the meme where, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, when the film
is so bad that it's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - No. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is that Hentai for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It is so ridiculous- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you told me why so
the room of Hentai, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is so ridiculous and so offensive, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that it it's not even turn off anymore, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it just becomes hot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That was Kudo You Know, for me man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's hot? You think it was hot? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I couldn't take this like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because you talk about you
on this to be realistic, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because you wanna like self insert, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, this is too ridiculous, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't see this happening,
in any fucking world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There isn't a million percent chance, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I would ever self insert
myself any why in the show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What part of it, were
you able to be like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is so hot that I can not do this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like what aspect of it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, I really like elf girls, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I really liked tan girls. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, dude, dark skin elf girls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dark skin elves- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dark skin, elves girls, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Replace every Hentai
with a dark skin elf, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I will watch any- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There is not enough
dark skinned elves Hentai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want my dark skin elf representation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm fine with that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the point where five goblins, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm pretty sure they created new holes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with what they were doing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because there was one the
immediate when he put his- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think there was only two, wasn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember the first time
he put his dick in, and like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - This was what was disgusting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is where I nearly vomited. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was like the gift way, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was just like a hole and like the train </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to smash its
place through the hole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Except it smashes it's
way through the hole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember the
first time I watched it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because you see the
outline of this thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> up to here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "Why can I see the outline, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that is disgusting." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because that's the fucking- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like my jaw hit the floor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when he fucking got the dick in man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it wasn't just that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember the scene where they cum, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like I remember most, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you see most like most
Hentai protagonists, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have like a bit of extra cum, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then like what any normal man can cum. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> These Orks have five
gallons of cum saved up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> all inside to this girl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where, I'm just like, "How
can I take this seriously?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> At what point does it cease to become, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and if it becomes whipped green. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The scene that fucked killed me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is when it like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after the first girl, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not the queen, but like
one of the servants right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after the old son, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and she's been suspended by two cocks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like fucking London Bridge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, "This is
so fucking amazing.". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so stupid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so ridiculous, that's it fucking hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like, she
just gets spit roasted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like literally spit roasted- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - She is literally suspended by two cocks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - With two old cocks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So gross. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Its so fucking vile. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is so fucking gross and vile, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and disgusting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I Googled how to clear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my incognito history after (murmurs). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, this is so disgusting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I'm glad I've watched this last, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it ruined my day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "This is so vile. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And do you want to know something too? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Episode, one's probably
the tamest, as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Episode like i think three
is probably the most vile one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> If you ever wanna challenge
yourself to that one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but, Yeah- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everything about it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was just gross. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I do not understand how anyone could- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is the exact
reaction I was hoping for, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm so glad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think like my penis
actually inverted or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I actually couldn't find it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I was so turned off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, but what if the
dark skin elf was a milf? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, even worse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's even worse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would you ruin something amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> No, no no, because, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's it should... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I do not wanna see four or
five Orks gang-banging someone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's fucked up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How can you take it
seriously at that point? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How could you take it
seriously at that point? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because what bothers me, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is that I'm watching this and I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "This is clearly something... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like they've got an audience," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like, "that's disgusting," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and some dude is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Fuck man, nothing does it for me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like that Ork gang-bang
porn, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's someone out there
who can't masturbate, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> unless it's Ork gang bang porn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I also love the scene where it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the queen gets like filled up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and the guy like pulls the dick out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it just gushes all out, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, like
a fucking waterfall. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah like a waterfall and the guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is like standing there
like, " Yeah, let it flow.", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, "Oh my God,
this is so ridiculous.". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This isn't a word I would usually use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to describe a sex scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But the sex scenes in
this Hentai, are epic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're epic, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, normally I don't
imagine fucking like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you know what I imagine going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like the background this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I imagine like forces from Berserk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> playing as like they
getting fucking gang-banged </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from seven different directions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's so Epic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like all imagine is like a
fucking like Zach Schneider, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like 300 slow-mo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like super slow-mo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I just want something like
that interjected in this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This looks like too epic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like epic is the correct word for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I need like forces playing
in the background, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> ♪ No forces ♪ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> It is a classic for a reason. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - A class? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is a class </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The classics (murmurs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like my vanilla Hentai. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like my wholesome tags. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I you know, I hate normally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I hate everything that, this
kind of series represents, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but this series does it so masterfully- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It really does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so over top </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Never really done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like if we're talking
about spice, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like Kudo You Know is
like the cinnamon jelly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, you have to do it once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did you feel great
shame, after you nutted? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Were you like, "God (murmurs)" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I never feel shame, jacking a Hentai. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm past that point,
I've Hentai Nirvana. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, like I never feel shame. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This gave me the same feelings of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you see like pregnant porn pop up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> and you're like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> "Oh, Oh God, no, no." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - No it's not that bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's on that level of disgusting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, way no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Its not that bad, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I would watch Kudo You
Know over and over again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> than ever watch pregnant porn. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - You probably do, you don't
need to say would you, you do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Would you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, I'll tell you why, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because pregnant porn is like
way too close to being real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> This is so far removed from
anything that's realistic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pregnant porn is level
one of Era Girl in my mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because this one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like set in a fancy
world in a fancy setting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with fucking Orks and elves. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The master fleet just
set up the scenario </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the point where there is zero realism. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So there is no point in
trying to self insert, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was no point in being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, this could happen to me.". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because this scenario is
just a 100% percent fiction. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So anything that they do, no
matter how ridiculous it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is fictional there's
still nothing about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that I'm like, "This is hot." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like there is no aspect of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You don't like the dark skin elves. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, that's fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I would have rather have it been done </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in that more tasteful manner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Allow me to offer a
more tasteful tastefully- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do you tastefully
gang bang (murmurs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Perhaps if we remove
the gang bang aspect. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Connor is like, "I can fix this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can fix this right here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Listen to right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We remove the gang bang aspect, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the fancy aspect let's
get rid of that too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then there is nothing left. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How about she's a dark skin elf, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who's a mother, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who has a step son, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> who you know, isn't so sure
about this relationship. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Shut up and go watch
Mother Knows Breast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just get Mother's Knows Breasts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and just turn her dark
skin, and there you go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's literally what you just described. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like that, that scene, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the scene with the second elf one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they take turns just
like, like cumming inside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> There's never been a more
accurate representation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like me and the boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What the fuck? No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The guys like, 'Minimum
10 shots each lads. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's go, lads, lads." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm fucking losing it just remembering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how was the gang bang. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm never, never gonna be able </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to go on set with guys again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's so ridiculous </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's it ceases to be disgusting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it somehow becomes hot again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hate it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not for everyone but, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> even if, even if you're fucking- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not for everyone, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like saying, "Oh, It's
fun for some of the families." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It is fun for that one
creepy weirdo on your family </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who Jack's off, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> way too much., </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and always brings up weird
stuff in an convenient ways. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - " I mean let's forward
I don't like it.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because this watching Kudo You Know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's an experience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - NO it's not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's your mistake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a fucking mistake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a fucking experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm convinced, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a trap, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a watch, watch list
in the waiting, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You watch it, you go on a watch list. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Later on in life, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you go to court, they'll
bring it up, guaranteed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I bet there's something
in that, man, that I Just... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh y'all don't like it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're going on a watch list." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what it sounds like to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't like it there so- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll say the perfect analogy, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't like it therefore
it shouldn't exist, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that's my argument. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Here's the thing right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> If we're talking about ice cream before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we were talking about vanilla ice cream </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> always been good to come back to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Kudo You Know is like the
rum and raisin of ice cream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No it's not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like some people
love rum and raisin, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> while there's a lot of people
who don't like rum and raisin. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like the equivalent of getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the two liter vanilla,
like budget ice cream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> putting it on your chest, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and scooping it off with your hands. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the equivalent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No because there's
nothing vanilla about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's rum and raisin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you like rum and raisin ice cream? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - He doesn't like any thing bout vanilla. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why you don't like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There is no co-relation
between what ice cream you like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and what porn you like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - No thee is, because you
don't like rum and raisin. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Deeply you don't I like Carolina, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like rum and raisin I like Carolina. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have never had rum and raisin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, you should try it,
you'd probably like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - The feeling it gave me, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Was when you get like a really bad fart, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> and you smell it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like way too much. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> It was level of like disgust of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> "Oh, Oh God. Oh Jesus.". </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> That's what I felt when watching this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can not relate was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I said like like spice, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is what happens if you just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eat 10 Carolina Reapers at once. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So some people it's just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it will blow their mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the cinnamon challenge off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is a cinnamon challenge
of the Hentai world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It may be considered
castration for a quick moment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "Honestly people
don't deserve to exist, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if they made this.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is six episodes by the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I saw, I saw Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I saw there was a loli in the intro, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because of course it's an intro, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, "Oh, she
gets gang banged too, hey,". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the episode three... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Pretty much everyone in
the series gets gang banged </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like the most ridiculous
over the top way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - In the most epic way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> These are epic sex sins
man, what can I say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Gang bang porn is like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Someone needs to do an edit with forces </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> on any of the sex thing
that kind of, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and posted on PornHub or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That shit was wack. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Gang bang is like, I don't get it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't get it at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I have no interest in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's weird like, I'm usually not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a fan of gang bang, but like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not a fan of gang bang at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - when it's done well,
like, I can watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And Kudo You Know, did
a, well in my opinion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so ridiculous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I see gang bang I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "There are too many dicks here." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's more than one dick, two many. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's only certain amount
of dicks I can self insert </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't self insert
myself in to six dicks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - As a male, there is no
fucking situation in my mind, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would love to be around
with five other with a men. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's your problem, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you self insert yourself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into every Hentai you watch, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So of course, you're not
gonna like a show like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it's fantasy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's a gang bang. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not everything I self insert, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but I think I get the most enjoyment- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's like a genre
you don't self insert? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is there any? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like of any Hentai you watch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is there one where you're just
like, "I can't self insert." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's plenty where I like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Those are the medium ones for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The best ones are the
ones where I can be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> "I wish that was me, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I wish that was fucking me." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't agree? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, I agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Kudo You Know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't like my favorite hentai, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's just such a
unique experience for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's definitely not my favorite, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I can always go back and rewatch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So it's a unique
experience in the same way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that shitting your pants is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't do it often </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and I never wanted to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> It's embarrassing and
I feel dirty after it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - it's a different kind of nuts. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Kudo You knows is like
Post Nut Regret the series. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Either way, I give it
a zero out of ten boys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah but zero out 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We just put in a milf in Kudo You Know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> then it would have been
like, at least (murmurs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kudo You Know to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is like beyond the scale. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - In all, in all caps I put, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "It so long, please make it end. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I legitimately feel sick" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You'll around to it don't worry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No will not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is like the meme, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Of like the older you get, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the more fucked up your
porn needs to be, to get of. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Like, I don't wanna get
into this at like 20, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like when I'm 40, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> what am I gonna have to get off to, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> like multiple city city gang bang. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - At which point did you realize that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh this this is gonna be
fucked up for the entire thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - The moment I saw the tags I was like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Fuck, fuck." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like mind control plus
gang bang, plus rape, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like the ultimate trio - </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like self fulfilling prophecy, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - The big three. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The big three. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Moving on to your, your choice, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, Kasen Sodom, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I have wanted to talk
about this for so long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Never laughed that hard watching Hentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what's is that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I've legitimately watched this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and nutted to a scene, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you seriously? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is the scene with the teacher. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It isn't it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The moment I saw the teacher who's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason the armpit
get zoomed in way too close. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because what happened was, is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm watching this, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm 10 minutes in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and okay, we should explain the premise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do we even explain what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, it's about a bunch
of pervs who are teachers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and those school kids aren't into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And then there's another side plot, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where there's police and terrorists, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then a terrorist gets... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's a weird gunfight, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> which is weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - We'll talk about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then they killed the terrorist </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and terrorist has this bomb, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it explodes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and it makes everyone horny, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then everyone starts fucking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a horny virus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But also when the bomb goes off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> dubstep just starts playing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Way too loud dubstep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The way I would describe this Hentai, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would never recommend this Hentai, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's awful, it's like nuts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was definitely where
I nut where I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh God.". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This this how room Hentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - How I would describe, this
is- What's the name again? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kasen Sodom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So if I were to put a tagline, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> imagine if Masaki directed
a Hentai ship post. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> That is, Kasen Sodom. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because it is like way too funny, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to be that for this to like not... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wrote down, it's like a
Hentai parody of Tekkonkinkreet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it gave me Tekkonkinkreet vibes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but for the worst reasons, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it like had some scenes in it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> where the comedic timing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It was way too good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why did you choose your list? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Just because you wanna talk about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanted to... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because this show is just pure bands. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you've never nutted to it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm really glad you
recommended this because now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I like wanna watch the rest of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just to see how bad it gets. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Another episode? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Apparently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, this is the only one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I saw Kasen Sodom one and, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I tried to look for
episode two and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> " Fuck man, I wish there
was an episode two, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the one of a kind." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because this is the type of Hentai, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you can only recommend
to boys you truly trust. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And if you're gonna watch it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's only out like at 3:00 AM, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you're fucking pissed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Can you recommend something weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and funny to watch?". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - The teacher scene was good fucking good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Come on it was though, come on. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't think so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, the entire time I
was laughing my ass off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because how could you get a stiffy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> When it was just that fucking funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This was the only one on the list, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> where I was soft as a pillow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I do not remember anything else in this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> But somehow- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you serious?
- Are you serious? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't know recommend this show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so you can nut to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why is it when Connor sees
a milf it's tunnel vision. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is totally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I watched this like two years ago, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I do not remember, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I must have skipped every other scene, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then when I found this scene, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and then when I got to the scene, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I must have been like, "All
right, 0.7 top speed.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I remember the
way I discovered this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was I saw it on PornHub. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just like a clip I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, this looks ..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because the animation style, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like very unique. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's very you I saw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's very you I saw,
that kind of close style. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, you know... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Because the thing about
a lot of Hentai is that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it all looks fucking squeaky clean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It all looks flat and shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Got some chunk to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, one's got some chunk to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's got some like
directorial choices in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I will say that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It hit me like a fucking truck </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when that teacher popped up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - (murmurs) it was, "Oh my God, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I've not nutted to this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was supposed to be a comedy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I am 100% convinced
that this is a comedy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> There is no fucking way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I felt like after I watched it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, 'Fuck, I felt
like I nutted to Cause 2.", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's embarrassing, that I did this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like reliving childhood and realize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like way different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Because like all the other
scenes which are disgusting, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and like fan a bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It wasn't disgusting- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The little girl with the guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> who was like delivering packages- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Called the janitor guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like."Ah!". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When she was sucking his cock </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and she looked like a literal horse, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a literal horse, sucking on this guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was so gross. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That face fucking
expanded out like here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know the scene that fucking kill me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like the teacher who took a photo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the girl's like underwear, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's like jacking in the toilet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the phone does the 1%, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he speeds up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He goes turbo mode jacking off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it cuts to this fucking
shootout that's happening, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they interject the shootout, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> with the teacher jacking Off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's so fucking hilarious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I also love this shoot out scene, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because there's like two cops, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with a handgun, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's one girl
with a assault riffle, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how does it end, one shot each. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Also it's going on for like six seconds, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and none of them shoot each other. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then just like the shootout... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You have I to watch the shoot out,. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang bang." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also with the teacher, and girl, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like he was jacking off the toilet, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he's like on the floor, he like stand up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and his dick gets hard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "No, the other thing stand up." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It was so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the fucking clip where
like the two girls arguing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> over who's gonna fuck this one teacher, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and then she turns around
and the girl just decks her </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> in the face (laughs), </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she just passes out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and she is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, teacher, now we can fuck.". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "Stop messing with him." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was the fucking... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you, the Squidward, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like Squidward hot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Squidwardith like normal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like Squidward normal throughout, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> but then when the teacher scene came on, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like (murmurs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Dude it's hot, man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's hot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm fucking amazed that
you nutted to this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> No, because... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I would say the beginning
of the teacher scene, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Where she is standing over the guy, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and she has like the pussy juice, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that is just like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's fucking weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - She's just like, literally, she like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is this drops of God or something? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> She's pouring this juice
from such a height. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's just like one long
string that like (murmurs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the thing with Hentai though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's so often not like a 100% </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what you want it to be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You take the good with the bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> When you found a premise that works, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right, if she takes
a on him for a second, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right I'll look past it
because it's 10 seconds, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll forget about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Will you though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you aren't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I'll get over it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like when that happens, it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm willing to look past this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just amazed that
you're this is zoned in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> into like the milf (murmurs). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That like you managed
to actually nut to this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the most insane
tunnel vision I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's managing to nut to
fucking Loony Toons porn man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because if you take it... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you were given just that scene, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> With none of the other scenes, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I don't remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the bomb going off or anything like so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm pretty sure I would
remember dubstep in my head. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I wouldn't remember that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just somehow. I just watched this scene, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and none of the others, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and when you say just that
scene with the teacher, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, it's easy to see why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think, why you could go away, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know, maybe (murmurs) into that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because it looks like someone made, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> a pentai paradody, of
mass like yours and film. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what it looks like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I've said, dude, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the animation does not matter to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It is the premise, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and how that delivers on the promise. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, I'm starting to think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can Jack off (murmurs), </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> as long there's a milf. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If the taboo is that Joey, 100%. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We've got an older woman, right?. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Check. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There is danger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There are doing it at the time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't know everyone was fucking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I just thought she was
going at it in the school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's hot, extra points, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And then, not gonna lie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> she is abusing a position of power. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's hot either. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She was a thick mama as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh dude, she was real thick, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is the perfect trifactor dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> There's taboo, thick, older woman. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sign me the fuck up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then like, I think
all of that like by itself, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I see all of that line up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, "Yeah, I could
probably jack off to that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then, it's topped up
with the drops of God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the fact that, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really weird zooming on the armpit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what that was about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Listen, you cannot complain, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> About like a bit of
juice coming down, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When you fucking jacked off to 10 Goblins- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was just the fact that they really... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think my biggest problem
that I have with this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just, I don't know who was in charge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the fucking audio
mixing on this episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but my God, it was fucking bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bang that bitch through
elevator or some shit, but it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, no, I feel
like it was purposefully man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Half the scenes, those
no like background music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everything about this Hentai was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel just like a masterclass, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in being like the ultimate
car crash of a Hentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It Is pure, garbage, it's hilarious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was fan for the family. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Had a little something (murmurs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was so funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What about that scene where like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the are fucking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the teacher's fucking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and like this close up zoom in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of her armpits. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, that was weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't get that, I
didn't get that at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I thought he was like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it was something like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, he's going to come up later, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the armpit's gonna be it (murmurs). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it wasn't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It wasn't no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was just shown, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, "Why?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It just ended so randomly as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It ends with a guy blowing
off a guy's head off, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then a girl randomly comes in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and just spot and kicks
this dude on a helicopter, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "What?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And the it just ends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then it just ends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No context, no fucking
epilogue or anything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just ends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I rated this
high than any of Joey's. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you serious? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I rated this- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, I'm never recommending </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you any Hentai ever again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What was it called? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Kasen in Sodom. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I gave it a seven out of 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I recommend, to watch that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> if you want a fucking hilarious laugh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But also maybe a cheeky nut, you may be. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I honestly, like normally </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't recommend watching
Hentai with the boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is a Hentai you
can watch with the boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This one you can watch
because it's funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At 3:00 AM, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get your next anime convention,
when you just wanna laugh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> at how this Hentai is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or if you're Connor just like sneak off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to the bathroom to like get- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm laughing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really wanna get the rights to it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so we can make like a Hentai party dub. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, if we are able to that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that would be like the,
perfect parody dub Hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like structured itself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like the ghost stories
of Hentai basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly, it's perfect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's already perfectly structured. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - My favorite part, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why this made
me laugh so much is that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they cut to a shot of like
where the gunfight is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the school, and like
the hospital something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're all like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - They're the only three
buildings in horizon. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like a child's play mat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Like the way that these are arranged </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like there's a gunfight happening </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in like an abandoned- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And there is a single rod
that connect al of them right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - And I was like, "Damn okay, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they really don't give a fuck." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where's the school okay then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, because I kind of realized early on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that they must be doing this on purpose. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I remember like the first shot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where there the two
girls were in the train, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and out of nowhere a fucking stripper </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or something comes out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - (murmurs) on the girl. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And the like the girl kicks him, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then he just like stands there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for a full like five seconds, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then nuts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was that pause before
the nut, that was just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - God the character
designs are just so ugly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then the, two girls ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then like the girls who got nutted on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't see a changing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but she was in a school uniform, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then she's in like
she's in gym clothes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the next shot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then the girls in front
of the fucking come too near </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like, "Does something smelled like squid?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then it's just the walking
animation where just like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The speed ups fucking killing me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was good, I really enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've wanted to talk
about this for so long, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because, I've no one I've
ever like talked to us ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like recommended or talked
about this Hentai because, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is such a funny Hentai, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and wait I've waited for this opportunity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when it can be like, "Yo Bros, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watch this one Hentai, you
gonna loose your minds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because like, when you go
to someone and you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yo, I gotta a fucking amazing
Hentai you need to watch.". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You need to trust the bros there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the bros need to trust you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because otherwise they're
just not gonna watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I highly recommend
watching this one Joke, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it is hilarious, you're gonna
have a great fucking time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had a fantastic... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not going to lie, I watched it twice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just because it was so funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, there must've
been other like nuggets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that I missed all the way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did not watch it twice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> One was enough to remind me of my shame. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, well then last
but certainly not least </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's go over Connor's
final one, which is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hitozuma Mitsu to Niku. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yo, okay hold up before
you say anything, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The animation on this is probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the worst I've seen in a long time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was pretty bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Goddamn all these
stories are hot as shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not gonna lie though, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The one thing that just... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, first of all, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm personally not that huge into milfs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I can appreciate like a
good milf when I see one, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was some hot milfs in this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, they're hot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's second guy that came, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of looks like you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> he kinda looks like you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No he doesn't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No, fuck off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I looked at that anda I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "Is this why, Connor likes this?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's his easy self insert </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That never occurred to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I did nothing like anything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like look it out, like, mood on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put up a picture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> out of all the Hentai
characters that I've seen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this one looks the most like you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck off. No it doesn't . </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Doesn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't remember this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's like kind of like
lightly like ashy blonde hair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, he doesn't look like me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Same hair cut as you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No he doesn't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No he doesn't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Out of all Hentais I've seen, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he looks the most like you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now is it hot or not joey? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which means okay? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Give me the pluses and minuses. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Obviously the animation it's Queen Bee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay yeah, it's Queen Bee, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I know the animation (murmurs).. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hate Queen Bee, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a love hate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, the main mom,
with the short hair. Hot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, there's something
about short haired milfs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that I really like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, nice choice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, like I said this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't have much to say about this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I haven't already said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I feel like I would
just be repeating myself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's Queen Bee, cool premise,
great character designs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you watched any
of the other episodes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of this Hentai? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's one in like episode four, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like a one shot, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like the premise is that like the mom, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's sitting in the room, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> her daughter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the boyfriend comes over, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's like, "Oh mom, I'm sorry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm really sorry and I feel bad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but, my dick won't fit in your daughter." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And she's Like, "Oh okay." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then he goes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "Can you please take a look at it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and tell me if there's
anything wrong with it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then obviously, you
know, he gets it out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then she's like, she's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh God, Oh God, Oh no," she's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I think you should hold it
so you can feel it better." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But he's playing innocent the whole time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think you should like suck it as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and then it's like, "Oh my God, it's so,"- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I Couldn't fucking get over, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the fucking bulges of the
gym instructors though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the first one, I'm like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Is that a penis, or are you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like smuggling a Chihuahua, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, because that is... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You might as well not be wearing pants. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Episode two sucks at this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but episode one was good, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it's hot men, I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, like I said, it's very you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's very- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The story is amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's very Connor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would say like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the other Queen
Bee anime was better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think Hentia Ash is
hot man, I don't know man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna say it, Hentaia
Ash is hot in Hentai. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I do not agree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do not agree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a reason why
(indistinct) is popular. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - You are against rape </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you're okay with NTR. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait NTR is cheating, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - No NTR, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is when there's like
you have like a couple </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that have like a
relationship or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And like the guy likes the girl, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and the guy sees the girl get fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I thought NTR was
just a for some reason, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this feels like a
different kind of cheating. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, there is a tag for cheating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah cheating is hot in Hentai. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Cheating in real life,
obviously is fucked up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> don't do it wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In porn where it's not hurting anyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - it does mean me and Joey can't say that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we can't say anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But no, no, because NTR- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - In a relationship you
can't say that cheating </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in porn is hot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nah, I don't like it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean personally like
cheating is just kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the same as NTR for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Where it's like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> NTR is a step above where you're watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> this guy get emotionally,
and like destroyed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you seeing his like life
get destroyed around him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I watched porn like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that was like really fucking up weird, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was like, this guy
had videos of his wife, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking someone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, I think I might have seen one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The difference between
NTR and cheating is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> if the guy's there or not. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I don't wanna see the guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna know he's a real person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> NTR's cheating but the guy's there , </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and she's crying, and
somehow he has a hard-on, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because I guess some people
like to get cocked I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So much NTR Hentai, the guy's
like he's having a cry wank. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I think in that Hentai </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I think they all like
have husbands, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - And it's like because
you don't see them, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> if I saw them- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He took out the milfs? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If I saw the husbands, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> and they did like a quick, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> "Hey, his Jerry Sheila's husband," </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'd be like, " Fuck, fuck,
no, don't tell me that." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Because they don't exist in my mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - But in this one you do see the husbands? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't remember that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's because like at
the beginning, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The short haired mom- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They drop them off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a short haired girl invited </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to join the dance club, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And then she tells her husband like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Hey is it okay if I go to it?' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And the husband's like, "Yeah, go for it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but it's just
hot seeing them be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Fuck, I'm really horny but I shouldn't." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The one thing that I couldn't get over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the fact that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think this is just
a me problem but like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the short haired mom, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as she like finally comes
over the fact that like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh I'm about to get fucked
by this gym instructor." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the gym instructor his voice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like reminds me of like
an e-sports commentator. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, so we're going
to pull the pants down, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and insert the penis." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In Japanese? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the Japanese equivalence. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the Japanese equivalence it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Can you feel the penis
entering you right now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, look at that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think Hentai is more enjoyable , </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I don't understand- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I completely forgot about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - She over comments, everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was literally fucking this girl, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and he was like a play by play. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like there could have been a
color commentary, on the legs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> "So what do you think
about this dick entering.". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - "It's like how does it feel
to have my dick inside of you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, I'm gonna move slowly now." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, just, fuck her, just fuck her. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just feel, this seems is really hot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> when the, the woman in the
black one was just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, you see if you can
join the club or not?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh,, the instructor that looks like you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> No, he doesn't look like me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - He does look like you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why I couldn't get over it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, "This is hilarious.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I trying to think
of Hentai that I like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> could like, look back at and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> "Okay, normally this is fine." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And that was only one of them, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> but there's a lot of them I just forget. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the thing I
didn't like about this is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the group sex, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't like group sex, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's hit or miss with me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a hit or miss for me as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like gang bang, it's
a hit or miss for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sometimes if done well its good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Group sex is peaceful gang bang in eyes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Group sex is just gang bang
but with just extra girls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's tasteful. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, it's gang
bang with organization. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I will tell you what is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> group sex is just vanilla gang bang. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Group sex is just for
people who are just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "No, gang bang.". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's got too much spice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's an organized gang bang. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I liked that it's very orderly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone's partners are designated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah it's like, "Choose
a partner, everybody. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> All right off you go do your own thing." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Group sex is just gang
bang with a schedule. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I like schedules. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - it's nice and managed but,
you know, at the same time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like we're talking about self insert, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't wanna fuck girls
in front of other dudes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Especially if those dudes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If, especially if you know those dudes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a little bit, (murmurs). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know if you
want to do that either, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll be honest, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, yeah, the thing I did
like about this was, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously the character
designs, I like it when... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, I like it when the milfs have pubes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I know something about anime vaginas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> when they take off their pants, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you see like their smooth ass vagina </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that look that looks like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's been put through a car buffer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know I know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like the biggest turn
off of me, man, I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like them especially
with the mature girls. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's what I was about to say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, if it's like, milfs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then like without pubes, it
just looks fucking weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But every other time like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't mind either way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But with milfs, it's
like no, you need pubes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, when I see like the
sights on my head shine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but on like a vagina, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "That shouldn't
be shining there, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a place that
should not be shining." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Someone just got laser surgery. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So to wrap up this horrible episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that was a five out of 10 for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was seven out of 10 for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It would be like it five (murmurs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was a better animated Queen Bee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I would say again, it's Queen Bee </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd rather read the source material. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a shame because I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it would have been fucking amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it had good animation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it would have been up there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It would have been like amazing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - As with every Queen Bee. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, some Queen Bees are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this is anime is sit and
the story is shit sometimes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right maybe but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they have like the best
they have the best deals, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they have the best covers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it sucks that Queen Bee stop animating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the best source material
Queen Bee, please, please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all I beg of you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every time I see a new Queen Bee Hentai, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, "Oh, cool, a
new doujin recommendation." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't listen to this guy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I want good animation in my Hentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We want high quality HD. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want my Hentai soccer guy , okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I prefer quantity over
quality for that, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nah, because you're the problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I'm not the problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean yeah, actually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in yours it's a problem but
it's a good thing for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Read more Hentai. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So what I'm proposing is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lower the budget, make more. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is exactly what
happened to the anime industry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They were like, "Oh fuck
quality, give me more quantity." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And then look what happened. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I want this probably with Hentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know when you see
the seasonal schedule, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the animated Hentai, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I want them swapped. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What, are you crazy? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't need choice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - My Penis can only get so erect. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't need choice for
T good in my Hentai man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like there's already
enough Hentais that is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't wanna be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't need the same
problem with Hentais do with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like fucking flicking
through my Netflix card. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You might just watch everything anyway. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean Let's be real. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna watch it everything anyway but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm gonna watch every. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The less the better in my opinion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, the only
time I blatantly skip it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is when I see like only
lollies on the cover. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm like enough of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Stop that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I get that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you see the cover and it's something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you immediately know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're not gonna like, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But here's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If there's more quantity, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then that just means there's gonna be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more loli hentai well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I mean, more shit for me to block. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So like, so why would
you struggle through that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when you could just, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you, you picked the ones that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a shitty argument. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This was an interesting
episode (laughs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This was a very heated
and interesting episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I wanna ask then, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not including your three that
you recommended to the others. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like out of the six that you watched, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which one would you say is your favorite? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mother Knows Breast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, listen to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The one that's not your own. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Which one's your favorite, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and which one's your least favorite. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Obviously the Fucking
goblin one is the worst. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So kudo You Know the best, okay, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, it didn't even
deserve to be ranked frankly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it doesn't like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It should have been deleted. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This was exact reaction
I was looking for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And what second one
that you suggested Garnt, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the one with the giggle long title. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't remember that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> The sadistic one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was the best one for you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, for me, I'd say
the best one is probably- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mother Knows Breast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Shikkoku no Shaga, the animation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because it's fucking top tier. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And the worst one, I probably
say Mother Knows Breast. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> They fear for what they do not know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I couldn't get over the animation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and the horrible pennis is(murmurs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - okay, I did kind of, get
off suggestive for the troll, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I know you guys know I love milfs, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like yeah, I spent like three years </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> since I've watched it, and I do remember. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You should probably rewatch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can recommend you better milf Hentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The third one you
recommended is way better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I remember it
saying about Garnts one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the kid, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like fucking a kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm pretty sure Mother Knows Breast, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the kids like 15 or something as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's like a teenager now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah right, I think
when I was like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> 19, 18, 20, whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, that's around my age. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But I think now, I watch it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> and I'm like, "Oh, that's
a kid fuck," you Know. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it has legitimately been a very long time </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> since I watched it, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but I remember just, it's one
of those things that like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the only title that
is burned into my mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's such a good title. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Mother Knows Breast. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - How could you forget that title man? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I will forget everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> about the show, except for the title. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm waiting for the comments
now that will be like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you wanna know a better than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Mother Knows Breasts? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sure, sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That has the milf in it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and has a guy who had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who's actually older and better animation? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also a great name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The Hills Have Size. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Does that sound familiar to you Connor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Hills Have Size. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - S-I-Z-E. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Would've been better if it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the Hills Have Thighs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Just saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I know this one has a Japanese name, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but it got licensed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's uncensored as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's not by Studio Milky. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Only 6,000 Yens boys for the (murmurs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I've actually seen this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Probably, probably. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm waiting for the comments, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> people who've got like 30 minutes in like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "Connor is just contradicting himself." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and now, fuck you, I
fixed it right at the end. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like going I'm through this list, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, "Okay." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which one was the best, Garnt? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which one is the best? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I felt like Garnt was
in the middle between us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I was probably
one of the most neutral, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out of all this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just like a bit of- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You like a little bit of everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wel there is a little
something for everyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I Know, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I know I'm pretty normal
when it comes to my taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the one that goes
like dairy queen like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Can I have one of each please?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like I'm looking at Connor's list, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, I can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> in good faith, pick a Milky, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> or Queen Bee show, as the best. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's my second called? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I also don't wanna pick just, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fucking Harem Anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No don't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt say it, say it,
Corinne is the favorite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, here's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Say it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So the best Hentai out of everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that out of Joey and Connor's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is Kudo You Know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The worst Hentai, is Kudo You Know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Correct answer. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - What was my second one called? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even know how to pronounce that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What it is called Joey? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (speaks in foreign language) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like evergreen for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> No matter, when you turn that
on, I'm like, "I have time." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you picked Succubus Stayed Life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Easy choice." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Succubus Stayed Life,
right? Is too easy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's an easy choice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because if I do that it's gonna be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that thing picture of
there's three kids sitting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around with a like, "I agree." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's too good to cook. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, I could have easily done that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I pick like Monkey is Happening, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like, (murmurs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I recognized that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because that came up recently, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I watched that and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh this is the better version." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But also I do like the
characters a little better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think, I'm bright. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I'm always right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think Connor once again
has the most, like, I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I like what you like Garnt,
and don't try to hide it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't go outside
of that mold at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Connor, once again has
the most jaded opinion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You see stuff in porn, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know, that not for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nothing does it for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a good milf dangerous situation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One thing I appreciate about you is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've got your priorities
straight in terms </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of what you like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, you know exactly what... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like your, that one guy
who goes to a buffet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and knows immediately where to go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're the guy who just
has optimized even your porn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You to a buffet- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You optimized the porn tags. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You have like a, entire menu, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "I know what I want, I
don't need to see the menu." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And there's people out
there who would be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Wow Connor, that's so boring.". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck you, I'm happy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Are you happy? Going through
the vomit porn section? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you happy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whereas I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Just give me one of everything.", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and depending on the mood, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I might like something different
on the day, I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This again has come to the fact </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I think that you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you stress about like everything, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> With like media, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What'd you mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can not decide what
you wanna watch, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I like everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and I like nothing at the same time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - On purpose, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I will just pick the first thing I see, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that closely resembles what I want, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> so I don't fuck around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well I'm not here to dilly dally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like for me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the reason it's important to me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is because I know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> how like like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me like if I watch the same thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna get bored of that stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it's not gonna,
it's not gonna hit as hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the genius of being like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Shout up Joey, I didn't
have to look at you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was this close to saying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I swear I have like early
onset Alzheimer's or some shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I forget half the that happens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's amazing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I go back and I rewatched it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, "Still new baby." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You should, you should go back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and watch the three that you recommended. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I honestly, I don't wanna watch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Mother Knows Breasts again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I know I'm gonna
go back and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Why the fuck did I pick it?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I know I am. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The thing about Mothers Know Breasts- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I picked it for the meme. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just bad, and it's
not even like so bad that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I can laugh at it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No it is funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember the bath scene being hot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But too be fair , any Hentai that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like five out of 10, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> immediately becomes an eight out of 10, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if there's an onset or
bath scene involved. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> You don't think bath sex is hot? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Come on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Come on, you not gonna clean up shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's whatever man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I'm not gonna
complain if it pops up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm also not gonna be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this doesn't ever bother
me, three out of ten. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean like I don't really find bath sex- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's your favorite place then? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is your favorite scenario. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You need a fucking scenario? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's your setting? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what, school? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Anything, like bedroom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Real camp. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Real camp? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> That's just one step away from on-scene. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is big difference
between on-scene and bathroom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> There is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is a massive difference. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt, there has to
be a setting that you- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There has to be a setting
where you see a up in the scene. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, "yeah." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like darkly lit real con room is like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I agree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I find them both hot for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean bath sex for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I find equally as hot
as like everything else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> For me it's all about the
scenario and the dynamic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - For me as long as it's
inside, I don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not really into the outside stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (murmurs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like dude, no, I'm here
to jack of I don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just do an insight- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Connor's about that
danger fucking danger wank. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're in the danger- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No wonder you fucking
Chromecast publicly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in your mother's house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's about confidence, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you fuck up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have a confidence to know that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll figure it out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't wanna deal with that shit, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Anyway, let us know what you liked. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Which one was your favorite, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> or least favorite out of
