<SPEAKER_06> charity stream that we just finished </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> he's gonna be like oh my God this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> episode's so they recorded this so long </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> ago yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> really really dating ourselves yeah we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just recorded the charity stream yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> which was for you guys was like a month </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> ago yeah for us it was two days ago it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> was a month and a half ago yeah oh more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> than that yeah yeah we're trying to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we're trying to get ahead before we fly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> off once again but uh yeah if you guys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> didn't know about it we just finished a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 24-hour charity stream for Doctors </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Without Borders and it was extremely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> successful yeah I was very surprised we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> raised uh 176 but we haven't added the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> amounts of 180 I think about 180 adding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> everything that we collected in total </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that's nuts uh which is absolutely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] nuts I'd like I don't know what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we expected out of this charity stream </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> no I was I was there was a part of me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when we were deciding okay what are we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going to make our goal and someone was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like 100 000. I was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> in 24 that's a lot of money yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah like maybe if we were like doing a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> week-long subathon yeah or something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that because I don't know I I only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> did one charity stream once like years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and years ago with Archie and like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did not raise nearly that much money so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I think in the back of my head I had </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that as my Benchmark yeah so when I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> heard a hundred thousand I was like dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> we're not [ __ ] PewDiePie or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> jacksepticeye we're not right we're not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> going to hit those numbers right turns </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out we kind of did because we were we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> were like number one on Twitch for like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> that night yeah yeah nuts I think we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> peaked uh 53 000 viewers which is insane </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah personal best that's definitely the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> most I've I've been oh this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> definitely the most I've had yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> definitely by far well I'm not even the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> streamer so that's so that's definitely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the most so I've been a part of it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> just ridiculous but uh how was the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> experience for you boys uh how oh you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know what even though I went into it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> with like zero sleep it was probably the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> most fun stream I've ever played yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah I would absolutely do that again </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> part of me is just like I would </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> absolutely do that again not anytime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> soon yeah part of me is just like man I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> remember those last six hours that was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I'll do it again once I forget </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about how hard the last year yeah this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is fine I mean at least you at least I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> had you guys and like Chris and like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Mouse there because like if I had done </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it by myself I would not have lasted </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like 10 hours no like I I was I remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the last two three hours I was just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> running on complete autopilot you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're just using like the part of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> your brain that isn't even thinking it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> just like habits you've built up that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> was just me I was just like I saw bits </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and pieces of the VOD where it's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like you alone on the couch you're just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like thank you for the 20 donation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> it kind of got to a point where I was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just like questioning my own Insanity </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> like like because it was just sanity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> sanity Yeah question my understanding </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> questioning my own sanity my favorite </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> clip though is where you where you guys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> were YouTube the couch and you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> started going well it's oh boy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and they got in the most unenthusiastic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> way guys get hyped guys it's like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> most not hype Get Hype guys I've ever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> heard it just it just had such like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> house party Vibes and just like when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> stay up too late and that there's one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that one guy that just wouldn't leave </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah that was that was like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> was exactly what it felt like when I'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> just like I I need to go to bed gone is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that one guy who doesn't know that yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you are gone you are like at every </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] like all night karaoke God is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the last guy I mean I mean I was last </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> guy on the stream as well I'm just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you got you boys uh I mean not this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't a competition obviously obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> but I I was the only one to stay awake </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> right right if it was Connor that was in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> your position he would have been like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> weak you're all weak I won that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> conversation it was me I carried I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think because uh because I knew you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> guys were there and I was like so I can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> sleep and I was like yeah I will yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> but I think if it was just me alone I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would have had to I mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah I mean I mean like the reason I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> didn't sleep was because I knew as soon </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> as I closed my eyes they were not like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> going I could not go to sleep and come </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> back up to like stream again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I just I just looked horrible like I I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> remember the last 30 minutes when I came </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> back I looked half dead yeah I was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> oh good oh God I think I used all my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> energy holding in the laughs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so much energy not saying anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> during like the try not to laugh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> segments yeah uh that took a lot more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> energy than I thought it did it actually </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> took more energy than uh doing the quiz </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> talking or just like hanging out also </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> not to mention that I think we like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> greatly overestimated how much energy we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> were going to have because uh we had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a schedule like a preemptive </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> schedule that staff made and we probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did maybe 40 of what was seriously </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> scheduled yeah I mean it was it was it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was it was a few things because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously Chris was scheduled for two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hours yeah stayed for six hours which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not I'm not complaining I'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> complaining he was obviously having fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah uh but then we also had like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> bunch of spring a bunch of things that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we were meant to be doing with iron </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Mouse but by the time Chris left and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mouse came on it was just we were so out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of energy that was like we can only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> manage talking right now yeah definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> how uh how did you guys manage to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> recover afterwards where did you recover </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> easily I mean recover is a strong word I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I went home and like weirdly enough I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> think because I was kind of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> reliving the moment when I was on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> train ride home so by the time I got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> home I was like wide awake for some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reason and then I I was doing a little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> bit of work and then my body was just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I don't think so and I just [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> literally passed out on my desk oh my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God for like an hour yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> for like 14 hours I think oh my God and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then I just completely [ __ ] my sleep </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> schedule for the next day yeah I don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> know like like my body's so weird after </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an all-nighter I hate it I absolutely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] hate him because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um during the stream I'm like I'm gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to pass out as as it's well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> documented that uh how close we were to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> passing out yeah and uh so I remember uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with the stream finishes I do not even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember saying like goodbye to anyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the office even though I know we were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like eh congratulations and they </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> game that was uh yeah when are you gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do the DLC Jerry you know you know what </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> was like you can't pay me to play the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> DLC I want my happiness back in my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then the moment I turned off the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> stream I was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to keep playing yeah because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like you're like but there's more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah because because it was it was the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> fact that there was so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> encouragement online when I posted my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time and people were like dude you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> actually cracked and I was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> okay give me a little more praise the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> game almost as a way of humbling you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I thought the same thing when I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> did like the third DLC also I'm correct </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know I'll be able to do this new one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like yeah I was like I was actually like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> worried I was like What if I like beat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this DLC too fast too fast and it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not a good stream yeah yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then like the first eight hours of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> playing it I was like oh no oh no this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is hot this is really hard and took me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 48 hours to beat the DLC the fan made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> DLC but now I know what it feels like to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> be an alpha gamer yeah and now I can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> finally say hey God when are you finish </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> remember it's got to the [ __ ] uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> after the no he got not even there like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> before that the the town in the sky </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> bargainville that's it I mean I will </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> finish it just because I I knew it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> like one thing when I started it and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was just like it's I I have the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> inkling feeling in me where I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't it doesn't feel comfortable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> until I'm finish it take your time yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's been a few weeks since you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> last we're gonna get rusty you'll stop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> for zero again I'll be fine I'll be fine </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it'll be uh I I will be like pure muscle </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it'd be like you never left it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna be like dementia the game every </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> time he goes back to he's like oh I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> gotta learn this actually it'll be like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 30 like my playthrough would be like 50 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> hours or something look if if anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you now have someone else to compare </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yourself to and that's mailing because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she also started it as well and uh that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> stream last night was hilarious started </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it as well yeah started it Jesus Christ </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah it's like a virus but don't worry </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you if you thought look like mailing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just got to the bottom of the sewers and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it took her like a couple of hours to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> get there so I just think it's like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the best games to stream it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just so it's so intuitive there's no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> explanation needed yeah you know like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some games there's like power-ups level </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> UPS you know and then there's like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> you can unlock this thing and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone say oh what's going on but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> jumping is literally just you can see </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> one mechanic you jump one box you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> understand immediately for from washing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that they're trying to go up and when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they fall you're like oh I get it this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is fun to watch it's also just a pretty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> game it's good it's a really pretty game </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it's good yeah I love the aesthetic you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> know I I will say you know I thought </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're bullshitting when you said oh you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know it's a fun game it's a fun game but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> no it is I I do actually genuinely think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a fun game there's a high that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get when you reach like your new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> personal business yeah you know what I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> mean you're like damn you're like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is a good feeling and then that lasts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like three seconds before you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fall for the first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I know we spoke on jumping so much on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> this podcast now it's just like taking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> over my life but uh on the first map </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's like a very solid checkpoint </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you get to that you feel like I can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do this the 70 one right yeah yeah when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you get to the the church the church </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and then you're like oh my God I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can do this yeah that's when it feels </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> good that's when I was like all right I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> got this you got this King yeah yeah you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can do it then if you can get that you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can do it easily so uh DLC for me is a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is a hard maybe then you should do it I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> think I think I want to like maybe put </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in a couple of like other games that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've been wanting to play Maybe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> firmly planted on the fence like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was your was your viewership higher than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> normal when you were doing jumping oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah for sure for sure but you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like what do I what do I prioritize </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a clout or happiness it's a hard choice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just waiting for when the Kobe game </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> comes out dude that's when that's what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> real happened I play games now like when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm playing like when I play Pokemon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> artists I'm like there's just not enough </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> challenge even though there was there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> literally was like there definitely was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but the thing was is that I never once </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thought for a moment I wasn't gonna be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> able to do it whereas jumping has that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing where it's like I don't know if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can do it man wait but you did the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you did that last fight yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah and you struggled a lot with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it I did but like at no point did I ever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> feel like this is too hard real yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because like to me like that was easily </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the hardest in-game Pokemon fight it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it is it is even then I I like there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> no point by doing it where I'm like I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know if I can do this yeah I don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> think like I just felt like I just got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to grind a little bit more oh man Arceus </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was hot as [ __ ] okay yeah I want to see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you where's like new bay plus when I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> playing that game with jump Kings the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> second map yeah there was like I I did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it over three streams so one on stream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> second stream third stream the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> second stream after it and I went to bed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I had like anxiety I was like What </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I just like can't do it what if I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> can't do it yeah like I'm never gonna be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> able to forget this if I can't do it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> then I woke up the next day just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Bostitch destroyed it right right damn I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> think you have an addiction I do yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there's definitely an addiction because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know there's been like uh I've kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of got out of like um multiplayer games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was kind of where I got the kick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from yeah beating other people but yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know there's a hard ceiling in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> multiplayer games where you're like if I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> want to be able to improve at this game </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I have to put an absurd amount of hours </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> in right yeah consistently yeah wait but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is is 45 hours in one John King man </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can finish you could finish 13 cents </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> think about it an FPS first person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shooter multiplayer game whatever yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> 45 hours is nothing that's true that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> absolutely nothing you're competing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> against people who do 45 hours a week </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah how many hours have you put it into </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> all of jumping right now uh 100 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> something that's that's quite a lot yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the Persona yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Apex I have like over a thousand </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> probably yeah that's true like it's and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> even then like I'm I'm just like uh I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> got to master once and that was that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that was me going insane grind well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> why don't you get into more like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> challenging games then because you you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> said you don't really play like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> souls types games or like I'm gonna I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna do Elgin but like I feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's it's a different type of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> challenge because with jumping it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like one mechanic that you have to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Milestone and master whereas with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> something like Elden ring or seafood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a lot of things going on at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> once yeah you know there's a lot of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> different approaches a lot of ways to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> master the game yeah yeah I just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> jumping because there's no like there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no [ __ ] there's like if you [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up absolutely yeah nothing there's no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> other facts single Factor yeah because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with games like dark souls or like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seafood yeah it's like it's like you can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> blame it on like the enemy like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that one frame hit me with it yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah like I know I'll make up this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but a jumping there's no enemies to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> in your way it's just it's just you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're in the way of yourself you are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> your own enemy yeah yeah exactly almost </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like [ __ ] no don't trust anyone not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> even yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like the hdlc gets more brutal though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like on you know first jumping you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> only fold like two screens Max that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what I'm dreading man and I fell like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> 20. what if I like actually start raging </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I don't want that though I don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> want to get angry not like an actual </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> angry though like a like an angry video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> game Angry you know what I mean it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different kind of anger I don't know how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to explain it it's an angle where you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you shout but it it doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually like actually get you upset </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right it's kind of like ah all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> back to it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is it's just a slight frustration a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> slight annoyance oh no it's stubbing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> your toe well there's there's there's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> different kinds of video games I I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> know what that analogy is yeah but I I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not angry when I start myself like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not like a 13 year old on Xbox Live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anger where I just test out all the new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bad words I've learned right yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like a just a mild frustration </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like when the website when you fill out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the whole form and then it reloads for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some reason you're like oh yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> then you're like really that's that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the anger you feel dude when are you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> interested have you not had that I get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so angry with that that's that's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've like filled out a whole sign up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> form put the credit card info in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> addressing all in the right space you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about to go to the checkout for some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> reason for some of your times out or it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> reloads you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] guts theme goes through my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> head yeah it's even worth signing up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> again I don't know I don't know if this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> is worth it anymore I don't even want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the trampoline yeah the worst part is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you fill out everything correctly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> except for that one field but the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> websites are signed in a way that when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you press send it it goes uh this one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> field is incorrect we've reset the whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> but they reset the end </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> of that one field like imagine that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happens but just it happens to every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> website you sign up that's that's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's so many Japanese websites every </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Japanese website dude like I don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if Japanese people are aware of ux </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> designers yeah they certainly it's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> like the amount of times I've been like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] cupped by not using like half </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> width yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> my [ __ ] god this is the biggest joke </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Japan and like it's something you'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> never experience unless you've either </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> tried to buy stuff in like on a Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> website but for some reason they have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> full width and half width Katakana and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> can you explain that by the way what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what is the point of full width and half </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> half I'll tell you exactly the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> difference okay there is is none that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what's so frustrating about it someone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> explained it to me one time had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> something to do with how they coded way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> back the the initial internet oh yeah in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Japan and it was like a layover from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that essentially that they're probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> using and they never like decided to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sort out yeah because I mean like I've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> told the story of how I interned for an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I.T company and I had to fix a bunch of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like clients websites and I had to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like through the HTML and I had like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> almost had a stroke looking at some of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these codes because it's like oh my God </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you said you built this website last </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> year you're using Code literally from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the 90s I was like what of course this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like of course this page takes like 20 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seconds to load even though it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> text based because it's so much [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> code here because [ __ ] uh it's so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> weird because there's so much like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> convenience stuff and stuff crazy stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can do that you can't do in other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> countries yeah and then they're like how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about websites we just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> weirdly enough the best designed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> websites are the [ __ ] anime trailer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> websites right yeah the ones that are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like they use like [ __ ] like pretty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like Java and like CSS it's like oh that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> looks fancy yeah like when that website </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> of like when the last Pokemon like when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a guitar are you uh volume was coming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out yeah and you're just like scrolling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> down for the entire history yeah of uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of the series I was like damn this is a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> beautiful looking website oh my God </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> someone an actual coder yeah an actual </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> programmer made this dude like can you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> not add this to your UI design when I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> trying to [ __ ] buy something exactly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sign up to a site like Rockton is just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a hell hole of a website because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't know you go to like because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like on Amazon for example Amazon's so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good yeah they don't do this because on </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> is the purchase button oh it's buried </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> deep beneath this [ __ ] wall of text </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and every time I go on a rock dead it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so handy because you get so much stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on Rockton that you can't get on Amazon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but it's a [ __ ] it's it's just a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> struggle to try and like buy anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it doesn't even tell you when it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> arrives I don't know that's that's not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the final boss the final boss is Yahoo </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_06> something else that sounds like online </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pay yeah yeah and I remember that I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> confused and I clicked one of them and </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> yeah really annoying really really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> annoying I hate using it yeah just don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bother that's what I mean like as well a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> lot of the websites that offer English </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they're like okay you click English send </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it to a brand new website that doesn't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have half the [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> whereas like Amazon on its like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> changed English nothing changes except </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> the language yeah it's like great it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> exactly like you know when you when you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go to like a Chinese restaurant with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> your one Chinese mate and they're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> bring out the special yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why it's like Chinese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> restaurants in particular but it seems </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> like every Chinese restaurant has the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> special menu that you can only that you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> can only get by asking in Cantonese or </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Mansion or whatever and I bet they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not even saying like bring out the real </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> minions probably just like a code word </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you know it's like Mandarin is an orange </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're like I said the word all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> right we can bring it out right now I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just like it just it just blows my mind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> because like you know I go to a Thai </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> restaurant and I can ask them in Thai </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whether they have you know a you know a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thai Dish that they they only like do in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thailand or only time most Thai people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would know but like it's just like why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> is it that Chinese restaurant just have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> an unspoken understanding that there's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> going to be so many people asking for a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> special menu that they're gonna make a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> special menu for in every single </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> challenge why are they literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gatekeeping </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can literally gay people like if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're not Chinese you can't get the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> real [ __ ] yeah it makes me feel sad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there because I love Chinese food I know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> right I never want to go to a Chinese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> restaurant without a Chinese socks </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it feels like you've just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> unlocked the starter you're the starter </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> kit right and you need to learn Mandarin </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to to get to get like the actual good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> gear right do you know what I mean </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_04> I've only ever seen that in movies I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> went to one where it was it was in </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> it's like a a breakfast restaurant or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something on the top yeah we went in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> there and I didn't know the password and </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> we don't know what the password is yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> he was like it's a Daft Punk song lyric </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he was like feeding it to me and I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it was something like I'm up all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> night to get lucky or something right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay so he said it and he was like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> not even like an obscure Daft Punk song </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you just go through the entire disciples </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> which album or which album are we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> talking about okay okay can't be too </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> many lyrics yeah if it's the Punk lyrics </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> that that narrows is it around the world </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> so then um we're here and then some guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> comes and greets as we start walking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through this uh restaurant that's closed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and then like in a movie we go in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the kitchen and there's people like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> working in the kitchen and we're just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like walking through oh [ __ ] and we go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> down into a basement in the kitchen and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like boxes of fries and [ __ ] all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> around us yeah and then like like in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like in a [ __ ] spy movie it's got the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] beads </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's like no uh little like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chairs or anything it's kind of like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a very small room that's very dimly lit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and it didn't it wasn't that good the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drinks are okay yeah and I was like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the coolest part was walking to this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> thing oh yeah yeah I want to leave yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well I've always wanted to know what why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> would you opt to make a business like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that right like you you I feel yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> feel clearly like if you're going to opt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be like okay I'm gonna make this so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exclusive that it's like near impossible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> for a regular person to find then it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you're clearly not doing it as a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sustainable business you know you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> clearly doing it as like a [ __ ] hole </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean it's the assumption is you'll be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> able to survive on Word of Mouth I guess </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that's that's the Hope a lot of people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> like it's so cool you've got to go yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then the drinks are very mediocre </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah the experience feels worth it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because you feel exclusive yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> just bragging rights right yeah you pay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for the experience and not so much the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know the bar or the business or the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh drinks itself it's like uh it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> bars that are membership only right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can only get membership by having </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone recommend you okay that always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> seemed really silly to me but there's so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> many of them well that's like you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's like like half of like the golden </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> guy yeah um </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as well is like that as well yeah it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like if you don't know someone who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> either works there or goes there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> frequently enough they just won't let </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you in yeah yeah but at the same time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like I I can get it with the bars and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> golden guy because the bars are so small </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm sure that their regular </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> customers can keep them keep their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> business up and running yeah anyway you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just see like one or two patrons so you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> keep get yourself going and then you'll </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> basically set that's true sure it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> basically said it'd be pretty cool to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> own a like tiny little bar in Golden guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've always thought about that but it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like what but like it's delighted to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a ball though yeah that's what I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always wanted I'm like yo but like all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> those bars even though they're so tiny </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sure they're paying out the ass to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> have that space because it's a trash </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Taste Bar there of trash day Spartan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> goldfish tastes special build a bar </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> build a bar in Golden guy all three of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> us build our own bars and golden guy see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who makes the most money at the end of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the night </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I didn't even want a mystical nightmare </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't even want to think about how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> much it must cost to like rent out a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> space I'd get really claustrophobic </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> walking uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's cozy I think it's cozy yeah I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it's cozy it depends I've been in I've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> been in somewhere it's like I I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> literally can't stand up straight yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> inside of them it's literally a shoe box </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> um and I don't even know how they get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> into the bar let alone work well most of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> them are like you know four feet tall </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like orbachans right exactly they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> probably don't have any problems it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> not built for someone of my stature if I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stand up I literally my my like head </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> literally hits the ceiling like I feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like Gandalf in Frodo's house in a lot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of these players around I'm just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> constantly can I get a drink please it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> normally if you're wide that's the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> problem though not not if you're tall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah that's true but that's why I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like going in the winter time is the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> worst because you're like all puffed up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with jackets and [ __ ] you're just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> all right out of the way please sorry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> excuse me so I think it's best to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> winter in the summer if it's weird I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know why I feel in the summer it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> way too hot it's really hot yeah even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> though the AC is going and still though </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> either way it's very much a gamble I've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> heard so many horror stories in Golden </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> guy and like Nichole man all that kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> of stuff going to a bar if someone tells </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> you'd go into a bar that's the rule of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> thumb yeah yeah if somebody's trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell you to go into that bar that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably probably signed to not going </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_07> I've only been to that golden guy like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> two times I haven't been that many times </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um and it's been a interesting </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> experience every time yeah the last time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I went was with you guys and at that bar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh yeah that was fun yeah which is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really really fun that's a good time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah we're like what's up uh that's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> one that uh Jan came to oh that one and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> he immediately went behind the bar and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> stuff well he just basically just took </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> over the box he just took over yeah the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> woman who was at the bar got tired or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> something yeah it was like this it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> owned by this like what looked like a at </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> least 70 80 year old like old lady she </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was really really nice but she was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> clearly standing at the bar all night </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the moment Jan came in she was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh that looks like a charismatic enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guy to take over my bar for the night </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so she literally she literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ushers Jan over because there were no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seats left because yeah there was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> us three and like two other Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people and that that was it it was so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> small so Jane comes in he's like I got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nowhere to sit old lady just like ushers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Jano and he's like take over and this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just goes behind the back and we never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> see her for the rest of the night and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like uh we could just like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> could just leave if we wanted to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously we paid at the end of it it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like a thousand uh yeah a drink but like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it was like you were pouring the drinks </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> so it was like yeah I could just make it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> as strong as you wanted exactly it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> became a self-service bar I don't know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how Jan has this effect like basically </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> everywhere he goes where he just sweet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talks the [ __ ] the [ __ ] restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the waiter or the bar lady to give us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the special service or the special menu </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the menu that doesn't exist yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah you know it's always it's always </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> something like John who was able to get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Jan is the only man that can somehow </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pull out a secret menu from a restaurant </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that doesn't even have a secret menu </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah it's just like oh I guess we have a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> secret menu now [ __ ] all right bring it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> up this guy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine like going to like a British </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurant or something and like gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get out the secret menu and it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like I feel like toast sandwich </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately the crisp toast sandwich </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> crisp sandwich I think the UK is the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> place for sweet talkie doesn't do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything yeah they just like no really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> no I've never seen anyone sweet talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything in the UK maybe in a bar with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> one guy yeah like in a restaurant it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> will never work or maybe it's because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they just don't have like secret menu </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> culture maybe no we don't yeah what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> would be on like the Japanese secret </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> menu there was like uh if you wanna if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you went to like sign abroad </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> or something yeah I don't know I feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like we don't have secret menus here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> either just because like we don't even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have tipping culture here because we're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so like just so like these are the rules </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> we can't make any kind of exceptions if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you're proud of it right well like like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> what I'm talking about is if you go to a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Japanese restaurant not in Japan oh like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what would be like the Foods on there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that would be something that you a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Japanese person very accustomed to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Japanese Cuisine would know but not is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like I guess not mainstream enough to be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> on like to be so you're asking what the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> most underrated Japanese food is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would say it'd probably be something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> slimy like most of the [ __ ] that we've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ended up feeling in you know what's in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the box and the Charities </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah probably something like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like maybe like I don't know um not on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> in curry maybe because I feel like a lot </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of Izakaya Foods would be on there oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah definitely like yeah like uh like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the Blended squid and stuff like that or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like takawasa that [ __ ] oh that's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> ball oh no way no way hey man you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you're part of my team now because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're like NATO okay natto natto was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> actually right it was it was all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The Taste is fine but the Slime is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Dreadful yeah really vile the Slime is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's not even the worst texture I've had </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in Japan I feel like it it looks a lot </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> worse than it tastes and feels in your </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mouth I think like I think the bean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stays pretty good I mean it just tastes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like soy sauce I think I mean it smells </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> basically what it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> soy sauce on soy beans yeah yeah soy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> overload right right I mean I feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> though if because you guys ate it like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> straight out of the packet you got like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the full brunt of like the the sliminess </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and the texture but like when you put </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that on a bed of rice because you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> eating it with rice it doesn't feel as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> slimy yeah I feel like I'm sure like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> with bit of rice it would be perfect it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would be absolutely fantastic yeah I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> mean I I guess you know you gotta you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gotta give it a go give it a go if you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> don't leave it it's totally fine maybe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe you'll like it maybe you're not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah like I to me like I I learned that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh I just can't handle ketchup I don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know why I don't know why like that was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the first time that was that was a lot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> of kids that was the first time like so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so far live streams yeah to explain we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all had forfeits to do I had to eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pizza crust drenched in ketchup and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mayonnaise because I hate to ketchup and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mayonnaise and you don't need the cross </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I don't need the crust and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember like I was like I'm gonna give </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this the best go that I possibly can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's for charity and it's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> first time where I've put something in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my mouth and I had like immediate gag </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reflex </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> like to me like the natto like I was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just like maybe I'm gonna gag you into </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> nothing I had it and I'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you expected to gag I think you expected </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to like throw up so you're you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> psyching yourself out the moment you've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it touched your tongue you're like yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um to be fair that that smells pretty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Dreadful but I had to do the ghost </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> pepper that was a that was how was that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> experience that that hurt see because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know you guys were saying like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh you know and everyone in the chat was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saying oh look forward to the next </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> morning like you're gonna you're gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be [ __ ] through a straw and I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh God no no the ramen was way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> worse yeah the ramen was way worse that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> we had but um yeah I was fine like I had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe like one painful [ __ ] and then I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thought that was gonna be like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> beginning of the end the one that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> spicy is the other one yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but yeah I was fine after that I just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know I look back on the this clip of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> me like shivering for 15 minutes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> afterwards and I'm like I literally look </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like I'm about to [ __ ] die </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah I was like getting slightly worried </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> when you started shivering yeah I know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it's because your body is just going </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into shock yeah pretty much and uh you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like your body is rushing you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> with like [ __ ] adrenaline and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> endorphins and all that kind of [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like I just remember seeing you like go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like this and I'm just like so you are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> you around me and like you know I think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the worst part about it is when you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watch that out of context you see a dude </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who looks clearly sleep deprived with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like huge bags under his eyes shivering </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I just look like a crack addict like I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just look like I was having withdrawals </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like sleepy like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not the best lawyer I don't think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the sleep deprivation helped as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I can't imagine trying like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> trying a food that you really it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seven in the morning yeah it was seven </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> in the morning we were up for like 20 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hours at that point and you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> perfect time perfect time to eat a ghost </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no to be honest I couldn't taste </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> anything oh yeah there was no flavor was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it as painful as you thought it would be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I yeah I I find that like sauce sources </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like really like heavy sauce based </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dishes that are spicy are the hardest to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> eat because like you know like the hot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one stuff yeah I can eat all of those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hot ones sauce like the hottest ones on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> wings like no issue like I don't need </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> milk or anything like that it's just it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> tastes good like the last dab yeah like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I like slather everything in that right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's all it's all good because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> just a few bites but it's very solid </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like we did the ramen video for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yours yeah and that wasn't that spicy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like it it I'd say like it's not as </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> spicy as like a Ghost Pepper or a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Carolina Reaper yeah because it's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> sauce yeah It Coats your mouth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> culture like esophagus and then it comes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the stomach and it it hurts so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah and then it takes a while so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you just keep eating yeah eating I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> definitely struggle more I think with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that than the ghost pepper one burst of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spice is not that bad it's when you keep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eating burst of spice yeah yeah it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> builds up multiplies yeah you don't you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> don't give yourself a break that's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like eating one Carolina Reaper for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like totally chill I could do it now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we could still film the episode and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it'd be chill yeah eating like those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> competitions where they eat like 40. I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that's fine how has anyone not died </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> from that Ah that's [ __ ] I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because I don't think you die from Spice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> no I didn't go in the shock though you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> can go into shock but I don't has there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> been a recorded uh recorded case or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> someone dying from Spice I'm not sure if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there is there has been you can throw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the whole through your stomach I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> necessarily think that's true though I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> think yeah you'd have to have a pretty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> weak stomach that I feel yeah because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> like it's a factor of things because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like for me as someone who like loves </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> spicy food like trying to explain why I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> eat spicy food or why like you know like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Joey's Joey's said to me all the time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh I don't know how you can like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get through that or something like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think one thing that's really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> under like underrated about why people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> eat spicy food is that the spicy food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> needs to taste good yeah you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we we when we think of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spicy challenges we just think about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting through getting through how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spicy this spicy meal is or getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through like this [ __ ] Pepper or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> something but a big draw of spicy food </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is that if it's even if you're off in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] pain and you know your mouth is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> hurting if it tastes good with the spice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you want to finish it if you want to eat </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it because it tastes good I mean that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was it with the ramen video like I would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not have finished that if it didn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> taste as good as it did yeah and it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> tastes really [ __ ] good if that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> didn't not taste good I would just been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like no [ __ ] this yeah like I found like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for example like the Coco Ichiban level </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> 10 spice and it is spicy but it doesn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> taste good like it just feels like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're making it spicy to make it spicy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just artificial it's just artificial </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right sometimes it just feels like this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> is just you know this is just a flex at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the end of the day wait we can make it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this spice but it doesn't even like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taste doesn't marry you well with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> spice at all and it's just like if like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> proper good spicy dishes need to taste </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> good in this complement the actual base </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> food right yeah yeah exactly like I have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like for example I have like Thai food </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> without the spice and it literally does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like there's a there's a component </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's missing from the food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um so good yeah were you gonna say uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> conversation does cause uh tissue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> inflammation so a large enough dose </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could cause serious damage to your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> stomach I feel you'd have to have like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> an egregious amount though to hit that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> point uh or something really spicy and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have it all in one sitting you could do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> enough damage to potentially kill you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> um I I just uh uh my ex-girlfriend was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Sri Lankan yeah I remember when I went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to to meet her parents and stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything had chilies in it of course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was amazing yeah I loved it yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was like it was like breakfast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> omelette with like five of those Peppers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you put in like Thai food yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I and I I ate them all and then I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know if I told the story her mom came in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> why did he eat the peppers and I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like am I not supposed to eat the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> peppers and she was like no you'll get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stomach cancer if you eat the peppers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like why would you put them in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> food what the [ __ ] they were delicious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> he was good yeah it was also like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> another restaurant because she stripped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me around to a bunch of the local </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> restaurants and there's one thing where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like deviled mutton it was called </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> or something yeah and it was like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sounds badass it was like the most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> delicious marinated mutton I'd ever had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in my life damn but it was like like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Doom level of spice or if it's got the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> word devil yeah and it was like I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tearing up but I'm like [ __ ] so good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was like even though I said like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> so much pain I'm like just another bite </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's so good that's the thing about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> spicy food if it's really good spicy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> food you're like you power through it I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just just one more bite take the bite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you're in a pain but you're just like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just tastes so good though I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> know how to explain it but like when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's super spicy and super delicious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's almost like it's searing in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> flavor yeah so I'm like this is so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> flavor because it's almost like if you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> take the splice out because I'm like for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> example I've had like very you know you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know I've had unspiced Thai curry I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had unspiced Indian curry as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because you're not in England and uh and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the best way I can describe it is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it just tastes flat it tastes flat so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> there's something that's missing from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the taste right uh uncarbonated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> certainly yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's a good analogy actually it's it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you the flavor's there but there's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a texture so the flavor is there but the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> personality is gone exactly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> engine car you know if you have rice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with it too or you have none I feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that's so nice to have like spice with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it because yeah it kind of help smell of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it out a bit yeah yeah yeah yeah see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like I never for the longest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> time I didn't understand that concept of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like spice enhancing food because you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know up until I'd say maybe like three </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or four years ago I could not handle </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> spice at all like if I went to Koko Ichi </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would do like level one yeah which is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the most basic [ __ ] and I'd just be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like no too spicy I can't do it and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what it was that like where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just one day I kind of just flipped a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dime and I was like you know what this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it hurts but I'm enjoying it for some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> reason </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> what is this see I I had like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> opposite journey of Joey some of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> someone who's grown up on tife with Thai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> food and stuff like that yeah so like I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would I like I remember as a kid I like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> really did not like Japanese food at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> because a lot of Japanese Cuisine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> revolves around you know the natural </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> flavor of savory mode like savoring it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and just bringing out the natural </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> flavors of the ingredient and me a Thai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> person being like there is not enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ingredients in this dish what sushi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sushi what that's that's just two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ingredients that's rice and fish what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where's the spice where's the flavor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah three ingredients like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rice yeah rice with a bit of vinegar in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it yeah uh fish and wasabi I'm just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where's the five million spices to go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with it what what you dip it in soy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sauce where's where's the chilies in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> soy sauce what's the kick yeah where's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the kick and uh like like Japanese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cuisine was like my least favorite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Cuisine because to me that just wasn't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> weren't enough like extra spices or </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> extra ingredients yeah cause the flavors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> unseasoned Sushi </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then As I Grew Older I'm just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you as as a gorilla I learned to really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> appreciate the subtleties in the flavor </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of like Japanese Cuisine where you it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> really enhances </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> um it really enhances like you know the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> good ingredients in it just rice all the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> same you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for 20 years to get the perfect thick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> rice so rice in it it's all the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we're just Uncle Ben's what does it says </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a microwave brush right five minute </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> rice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Minute Maid rice yeah well I [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> love the golden rice in those microwave </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> packets though I [ __ ] love that Rice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> oh the the ready to make ones right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it tastes so good yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly fast food rice how do we make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> rice unhealthy super unhealthy we found </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> a way </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah honestly like the false food uh the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> the packeted fried rice that you can buy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> is actually pretty damn in Japan it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty good in the freezer yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was like oh well I made Curry and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't want to make I didn't have a rice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cooker at the time yeah yeah and I hated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> making rice the way that my mom taught </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> me which was just boil a pan full of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> water yes yeah which sometimes worked </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes didn't yeah uh but doing it in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Japan is like Blasphemous I know I know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know but it's like it's weird because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd think that like the first people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to adapt an easier way to do it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> would be white people because they love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> being lazy that's true so like you'd </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think they you'd think Rush hookers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> would go down like especially for the UK </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where we love rice yeah like we love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> eating it with curry so like you'd think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> too dude do people in the UK love rice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> with curry that's pretty much it though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's the only thing we eat half </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> the time chicken tikka masala is like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> every every week that's true you'd think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we would figure out like hey these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> rice cookies aren't so bad yeah because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like I remember growing up in the UK </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> whenever I'd like have my pack lunch or </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever my it would be like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you'd never make rice for a packed lunch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's the dinner thing yeah I know uh no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] um </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> sorry sorry the tea to me is the drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> as as with as with motion as with most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> of them for me is a twit longer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> awful joke awful joke no but like I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> remember having this conversation with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> my mates but and they were like wait you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eat rice every day with every meal and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like yeah yeah like you you have it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with every meal and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they couldn't like wrap their heads </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> around you bougie [ __ ] yeah you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eat rice with everything everything you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't take a brace from right I break </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> from Rice you just it's everything I'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like yeah it's it's Asia it's Asian </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Cuisine you could you literally eat rice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> with end every with everything I'm sure </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the Asians are asking the same thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> being like wait you eat you use bread </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> with everything but also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> every meal is bread it's bread or </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> potatoes yeah wait is that is that it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that it bread or potatoes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> carbs on carbs I mean I think it's I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> think it's grown a lot popularity there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in the last 10 years especially rice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah definitely not when I was growing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> up at all yeah because it's become way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more popular like rice based uh dishes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in general but uh you know I think uh I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I say finally right yeah yeah but I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> think there's enough dishes where people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are making them wear a rice cooker </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're peeled by bread makers people are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> making bread every [ __ ] and if those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> things are [ __ ] massive yeah right by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the time my little rice cookers like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this big but the point was before I did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this uh I used to just buy the microwave </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> packets they're amazing like yeah 300 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gram packets yeah perfect portion tastes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> great slap it on the plate they're good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to go yeah yeah amazing amazing I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> actually you know I actually think those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I I also survived without a rice cooker </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in University for a long time because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because the microwave packets were good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> enough and the problem with a rice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cooker </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um I find is that the rice goes off so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] quick so either you like cook a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> tiny bit of rice in this massive rice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cooker because I'm Asian and of course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if a mum if a mum buys you a rice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cooker it's like the biggest [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rice cooker you could ever imagine how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> many families </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like this restaurant one where it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like this big luckily there was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> humanitarian crisis but it wasn't for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> long because gone had his rice yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because because like my mum my mum like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> bought me a rice cooker for University </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> because that's like that's like one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the essential pieces of equipment that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you do for University for every Asian </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kid that the mum provides of course and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you they provide you a rice cooker that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> could survive a nuclear winter you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you you you you could pretty sure you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> can like I'm pretty sure you can like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> hop inside of a Survivor blast yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right right but the problem is like I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> would always cook too much rice or too </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> little rice right that yeah I would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> either like it would be like either too </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> much for the meal I was cooking I would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have some leftover rice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um or I'd have cooked too much rice and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the rice just goes off so quickly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> even if you put it in the fridge or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something because unless you're this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is the Asian trap right because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the rice cooker you have to eat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rice every day in order to cook in order </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to eat all the rice that you could with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the rice cooker otherwise it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to go off exactly um so that's why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> actually the microwave packets were just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the perfect portion yeah for for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like one meal and it was just like a lot </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> less effort yeah because then you have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to like start experimenting like you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> look in your fridge and be like all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right what can the rice go with that I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> haven't tried I don't know can you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> dehydrate the rice that you've cooked </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> turn it back into a rice grain is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> possible well I mean uh if you had the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> technology I'm asking is it possible </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well I mean like I I put it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> no it's like popcorn you don't turn back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to it oh that that form is completely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different though the rice stays the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I think if you took the water </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out somehow maybe we could do it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> scientists </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my family uh actually a lot of Japanese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> families what they do is if they make </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> too much rice then you put it into like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> small you know like maybe </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> microwave-sized packets and then you put </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it in the freezer yes yeah that was also </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> what happened as well yeah but but it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like not the same like the next morning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you wake up and be like you know okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's some leftover rice if I don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eat them my mom's gonna [ __ ] throw </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> hissy fit so let's let's just get it out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> defrost that [ __ ] but there was no space </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> in my freezer to put extra packets of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Frozen rice you know why as a universal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here what happens when your mum comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> over she brings you eight [ __ ] eight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Tupperware boxes full of takeaway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> foods and then and then you gotta put it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in the freezer and it just lasts the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> it'll last you the entire day you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> the entire [ __ ] term I was that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] you know when you've got to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> share a freezer and some [ __ ] makes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> takes up the entire [ __ ] thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because he decided that his he was going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to meal prep like like an entire month </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and you're like you're a [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> know that like we gotta share the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> freezer where is my Ben and Jerry's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna go where am I gonna put my body I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> just wanted one Ben and Jerry's in here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is that too much to ask you know like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stop playing Tetris with all the rice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> packets yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like my mum would come to visit me once </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a month in University and every month </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she she'd bring like two full like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sainsbury's bag worth of like takeaway </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> boxes of holy [ __ ] and I'm just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that that is I don't know I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how many people were in your like were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> you sharing one fridge with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like uh six or seven or something like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that so at best you get you have half a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> shelf to yourself yeah and then you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one like a freezer's even smaller yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so you had like what two items to put in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the freezer God you must have been hated </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> like we moved in it was a bit beat up it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't like great my mum was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mortified she was like oh my God this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place is a [ __ ] oh my God you can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't live here I'm like it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that bad I'll get over it I'll be fine I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just remember her reaction she was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I thought she's actually gonna be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you can't you can't you have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> find somewhere else this is too old I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> was like no it's fine I wasn't even that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> bad it was kind of messy is this one in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Swansea yeah but it was and that one was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the one that later had like rats oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think the rats were a part of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> the initial moving in thing they joined </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> later they moved in with me they were </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the other roommates </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no I didn't I didn't I didn't pre-order </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> those unfortunately uh yeah no I mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] I I think that everything I I only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ever had like white roommates actually I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> guess in Swansea there isn't much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> diversity there was I did have some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> friends here from like uh from from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Chinese schools but most of them did </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Super students or they just a lot of a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lot of foreign students come together </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right right yeah there's a there's a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> very like the UK has a lot of foreign </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> students yeah that makes sense </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] spread run death dude like I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like Speed Run death oh yeah no listen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you never said you go to a boba store </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> now there's like maybe one or two people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> there that's nice that's true well this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> there's still a thing in the UK from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> what I can see they still like exist the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stores I don't know it's still around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's not just just rightly so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because I thought it was like overrated </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the [ __ ] I think so I did I didn't get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> what the craze around it was I mean I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> drank I drank a shitload of a dream uni </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because we had like a boba store near </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like where we studied but like I get it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but that was before the explosions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> a while because it's cold so you can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of just sip on it throughout the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> day if you if you ever get a big one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> also if you're a uni student it's a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> great Sugar Rush yeah concentrated I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> guess everyone everyone after a while </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> was like in Japan at least we're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> all right back to Starbucks now yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> back to Starbucks to the way life should </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have been I just I just I saw nothing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> with just iced tea or iced coffee I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> don't know maybe to me it was like but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not fun there's no there's no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> personality I'm a hot boy I like I like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> my drinks hot I don't really like cold </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> drinks that much that hot Boba too </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> though right I think hot boy bridge is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not it's not the same yeah I think they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do but it's not it's not as good I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> believe you can order it with like no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ice sometimes you know when you can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> customize lukewarm though that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lukewarm it's like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know I don't know what Maniac </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> would order warm Boba but it was an </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> option in some of the Bible stores I've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> been to it was like a specialty I'd be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like okay if you say so is that was that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> a secret menu did you have to wait a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> secret menu did you have to speak </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Chinese together it's like I'm a Chinese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friendship </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like oh so you know your [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know like I I don't know power </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> wire exploded but I remember it just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like not just in Japan but just pretty </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> much everywhere in the UK everywhere in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Thailand you just couldn't get away from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it like even in the states it was just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like fashionable I think this is a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> fashionable drink yeah I guess so and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> think it's instagramable </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> you know let's be honest 2014 was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh was although like the Frappuccino </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what it was yeah that was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> thing everyone just wants a photogenic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> drink and Boba looked photogenic but I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> feel Japan took that like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> photogenicness of boba and just like was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> trying to stretch it out to such a high </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> degree where it was just so unnecessary </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like everything in Japan though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> everything is about taking photos like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> afternoon tea I love my afternoon tea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's much worse thing I've ever said I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> really really enjoy going for tea and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> having crumpets or scones that is like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> weirdly popular subculture in Japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't it it is but everywhere I've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just does it really badly really they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they okay I mean not badly oh it's hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to say not as good like I to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> afternoon is just as much about like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> food you get as it is the tea yeah right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right and the food isn't great it's it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the food here looks so aesthetic but it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> doesn't taste good yeah yeah that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> literally all they do is they make they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> arrange it and they get these like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> beautiful colored things and then you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> take one bite of the quiche you're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> why does it taste bad yes I actually </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> agree so that this is like afternoon tea </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is one thing that England does the best </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that I've had so far because the the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> afternoon tea food is actually good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> whereas in Japan every time I've had </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> afternoon tea it just looks pretty also </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's got to be layered right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so like the layers are to distinguish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the types of flavors bottom is for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sandwiches then maybe you get like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> the quiches or the more like Savory kind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> of uh like kind of the dishes it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always sandwiched pastries yeah and so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> so it's like Savory sweet Savory and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then sweet yeah but it's right it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sweet sweet Savory and also sweets but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like it's ridiculous it's like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't because normally afternoon tea you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of have it at like and we have it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the afternoon yeah but you know if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a good place you can all we like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> skip lunch or dinner with it because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's pretty hot like it's quite a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah some places even refill yeah in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> UK they refill the sandwiches or stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in some places so you can just light you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can Chow Down dude yeah if you like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sandwiches or you like the whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they're offering dude it's good it's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you get money's worth yeah expensive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> though in London it's very expensive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I bet it's good it's really good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's an experience you're paying for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> right yeah yeah yeah yeah one thing I've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> only seen really in Asia as well going </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> off like the Boba thing before like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> guess the baby crazy thing I've ever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> mentioned by the way I just realized </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> privilege maybe like the tea isn't good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> enough it's disgusting no sandwiches I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> mean I mean it's one thing I feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Britain does well so I I think it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good it's no correct </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but yeah like uh dessert dessert cafes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's that's one thing like I only saw </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> in Asia oh yeah and I don't I don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> if there is more dessert cafes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dessert buffets what's that it's it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's literally exactly that think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> of a buffet but it's all desserts yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because whenever I'd hang out with my uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like some of my friends in Thailand </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they'd be like oh let's go to this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> dessert cafe I'm just like wait like to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me growing up in England dessert was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> something you have at the end of a meal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> at a restaurant right you don't go to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> specific place to to eat dessert right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was that concept was just alien to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me yeah and like I to me it still feels </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> weird right because I would like if I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want dessert after a meal I would order </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it at the restaurant yeah but like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to a dessert cafe and it's like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like half a meal you know you know you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know because like you never you never go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to a dessert cafe after you finish </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eating at a restaurant yeah but you go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to a dessert cafe at like really weird </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> times the other day and yeah yeah three </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> or something yeah I go to a dessert cafe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I have to dessert and then it just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with my eating schedule because then I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> just don't want dinner yeah but it also </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> doesn't fill me up as well it's it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> really weird so you get hungry at like 9 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> p.m yeah it's like a really weird time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like oh it's kind of too late </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to eat food yeah right but I'm I know I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> won't be able to sleep because I'm gonna </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> get hungry yeah yeah no I get that yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't I don't want it I don't know I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just don't feel satisfied if I've eaten </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of something sweet but yeah when I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> eat like a Savory meal yeah I just feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like happy I just feel sick if I eat too </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> much sweet stuff now yeah yeah I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> always like that though like I could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never eat too I like sweets but like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> could never eat too much of it because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then I just get I'd be filled up but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then that feeling of being filled up by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sweet [ __ ] it just made me feel really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ill which just made me want to eat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> regular food anyway man I I said this uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like a year or two ago but man I I still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't like themed cafes in Japan they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like collaboration cafes the food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because of the food the food and drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like a jerk it looks good that's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing is that I hate the fact that we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> turning like food impractical we're like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we're we're like okay well we put a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> little uh I went to the Square Enix one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> oh yeah and then they made me a latte </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like this latte tastes really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> bad yeah yeah but they put a slime on it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> so I guess now it's worth nine dollars </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and I'm like what uh there's only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> been I've been to so many themed cafes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because akilov's going to them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> um like because she makes content out of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it so it's understandable but uh I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the only good one where I would actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> go back for the food is the Kirby Cafe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I know it's good because no no I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know it's good because the biggest Kirby </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> facts </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Cafe has the best food it does water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> what a coincidence it legitimately does </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and I know I'm not the only one who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thinks that because it was a temporary </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thing at uh [ __ ] Tokyo Skytree but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> now they made it made it a permanent </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thing so you know if a themed Cafe turns </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> permanent that that's how you know that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the food is good because if the food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sucks then people don't come back it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a novelty to it that's really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> short-lived and once you've like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experienced all the food and you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experienced that themed cafes like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know style and everything and you've got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grabbed all the [ __ ] merch you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> because there's always a merch shop </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> attached to it as well then you're not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna go back I don't know because to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like the food itself is is the art </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah don't draw all over my state don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> reassemble the carrots to look like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> smiley face but I think that's why I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the Kirby Cafe because the Kirby </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cafe they don't [ __ ] around with the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> food they [ __ ] around with the cutlery </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so like the plates are like certainly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] like shaped in certain ways or like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the cups are shaped in certain ways but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> the actual food itself is normal once </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you once you put it on a regular plate I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know if I'm like a scrooge or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something just don't enjoy fun or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> whatever but like I just don't want </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> people like making faces or [ __ ] out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> with my food I don't want my food to be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like a toy I get I I I'm I'm exactly the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> same way where if I go to a themed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something of like something I'm a fan of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> then I don't want them to [ __ ] around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> look look I'm I'm here for a good time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to enjoy the thing I like I'll buy them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> give me like cool much any like cool </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> exclusive merch that I can buy in a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> better way to get one with the show than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to digest the show I'll do like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> typical examples when we went to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Bucky exhibit right yeah I saw this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> poster that was like oh just down the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> block there is a the Bucky Cafe like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Bucky themed Cafe and my friend and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were like because you know I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hitting around you know lunch time like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> early afternoon we were like all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> let's let's go check it out all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> let's go see the menu and I saw the menu </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like this is the laziest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> attempt at a themed Cafe but one of them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> was like retsukayo's Neapolitan pasta </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like what the where does retsu </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ever eat Napoleon pasta in [ __ ] Bucky </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like they are really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stretching it they're like they're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really stretchy to make it on breathe </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's Mickey Mouse's world famous </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> lasagna yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> one of them was like you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it didn't even have uterus face on it it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> was literally just a cappuccino nine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dollars </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> so themed cafes are meant to in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where they have a dish on the menu </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just like you know [ __ ] uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> rin's special Curry from Fate Stay nine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like when when did this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> happen how is this on brand why did you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just add it you literally just added a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> character to a random dish you caught </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> you call it Brands I find it like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> insulting it's like you're you're you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> insulting my intelligence yeah you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> insulting my fandom yeah yeah I like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> think I'm just gonna buy this because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you put this character on it I'll take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> two but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like you like if you if you had put </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the [ __ ] like Neapolitan pasta in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> front of me I would have been like oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just the rail in the Paul's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> impossible like do you think that if if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like but it's retires no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> problem then I'd be like well [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sign me up then I'm gonna eat the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of this like this is why like when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you go to like Wolfgang Puck's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> restaurant he doesn't serve like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> smiley faces on his stage you know I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mean like I just don't want I just don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> want that like I don't want it it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the stage it's a really nice restaurant </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah there's initials yeah what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is this what is this is a horse like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're branding it was it running away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like what's going on like this is our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> state yeah like I I just don't like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah to me it's like it's such if a food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> has done well it itself is so beautiful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now pay for it it speaks more but you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> know just have the decor of the cafe </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> have everything else be like just just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> make it like everything else but the </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> yeah and I can sit and [ __ ] I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that's what I appreciated about the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Kirby Cafe was that they didn't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> around with the food they [ __ ] around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the cutlery which you can then buy </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> like even then it's like they couldn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even put the effort to do that and it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh the thing I felt the most sorry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about was the fact that like I looked at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was like two like clerks who were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like standing behind the counter and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they looked so dead inside because pen </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> just shove a pen in my ears just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> blur out the sound they look so dead </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> well that's that's kind of how I feel </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like all of the truck drivers who drive </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> around like [ __ ] Harajuku or whatever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they have to drive around promoting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> these Idols or whatever </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_00> we talk about I swear we've mentioned it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's these trucks that drive around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Japan where they'll play music yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> really loud yeah or decorative trucks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah and they're awesome they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> awful it's basically just like a moving </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> billboard basically yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can't make noise in your own </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> apartment but anyone can make as much </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> noise as they want on the street it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really weird yeah right someone can come </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> back </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> potatoes and uh intrude our like streams </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> running for government just scream in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> public yeah it's just like what what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> year are we in well you don't don't you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have like social media you could promote </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh no but no I'm sure you're really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> connected with the Youth of today by </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> driving around a truck what do they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> expect for like everyone to come out of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> their houses it's like guys honey wake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> up it's up for new politicians in town I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> mean even if it's old older people right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> well they're not gonna get up to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> outside to listen to you drive by maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why they're loud otherwise </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're not gonna like hear it right so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> they just like broadcast </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they broadcast all the houses honestly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> probably we're going to make it through </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the hearing aids </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in an interesting spot where like they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> have to uh political people have to try </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and go towards the older generation yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so all the techniques they use seem like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> archaic as [ __ ] yeah it's the only way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they can get elected because if you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not in someone's letterbox they're not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're not getting interested isn't it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> weird isn't it like they just the whole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> political system is just catered what I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just don't understand though is like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah I'm sure they're like you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> being loud as [ __ ] right on the street </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so that again as you were saying like it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> can reach the old people's ears right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah there's a lot of people yeah as old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> age comes naturally you become hard of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hearing and yet these same old people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can hear like the tiniest Creek from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> upstairs and be like oh my God that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> too [ __ ] loud how dare they walk so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> loud in my apartment meanwhile I'm </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> bag and just didn't put it out I heard I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> heard I heard that apparently they were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cycling even though they they make you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shorter very strict actually when it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> goes to the planet apparently I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> know how true this is that it's not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actually like they don't recycle it as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well as you think they are yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah I would believe that yeah I mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> fair enough yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but [ __ ] dude I I one time I went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down to my recycling thing in my current </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> place I thought hmm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I I was just I was putting out my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bottles in the bottle thing I noticed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that there was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> plus Bombay Sapphire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gin bottles right and I was like who who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has drank this much Bombay Sapphire this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was gonna say I thought that was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> another person who enjoys Bombay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> soundtracks and I was like huh I wonder </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who's bought this much Bombay well I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna keep saying it's very satisfied </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> well it is another British person in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your building I was like either </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somebody's running a bar secretly in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> their apartment but specializes in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Bombay Sapphire cocktails someone had a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good night well there's a really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> depressed British person somewhere in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this apartment building who is really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really spending a lot of money on gin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I just thought why would you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this many they're all neatly stacked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like almost like a jenga-esque stacking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> style I'm like this is a prep this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> definitely one person who brought I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wonder if they collect them for a long </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> time they thought no this is ridiculous </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't collect this many bottles </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because some people keep their alcohol </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> containers afterwards yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like a memory but yeah I guess when you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> drink too much you're like yeah okay how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> many how many Bombay sapphires is too </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> many I just thought I was like this is a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lot I'm like yeah what's going on here I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wonder I was like what a weird trash do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you ever see people's trash and you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> think what's going on oh yeah yeah get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> on with that many times I remember the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> weirdest one I saw was uh it was a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> vacuum cleaner that had been perfectly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> cut in half down the middle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what happened someone's like damn man I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just wanted to ask you to see what's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> inside it was like it was like a Dyson </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it was like the body of a Dyson but it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had been perfectly split down the middle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but there was only one half and I'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> where did the other half go serial </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> killer yeah just one half it was only </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> one half and I was I was kind of I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like I feel like five minutes I was kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of like looking around seeing like I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wonder where the other half is I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't find it so he's either kept the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other half or I've witnessed uh some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> crucial evidence of a crime scene or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> something like I don't I don't know what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> specifically it was the weirdest thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> at least I was like oh well now I know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> what's inside of a Dyson </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like something you see for like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> YouTube channel yeah I know how what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> happened what's inside of a dice what's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> inside of a Dyson but if I cut this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Dyson in I just want to know how they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> did it they must have like that it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> either someone has a laser cutter inside </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of their house or they just went ham </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with a saw I don't know either they have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a shorn in their house yeah it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> somewhere else and then they brought </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> half a dachshund to your apartment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> building and then they decided that they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are done with half a dice they're gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> throw it away it was the weirdest thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I've ever seen so annoying having to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rid of big stuff in Japan it is you buy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> those stupid stickers from the comedian </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you can't throw out a a if it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> bigger than I think 30 centimeters in my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> apartment yeah something like that which </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is nothing yeah there's so many things </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that are 30 centimeters or bigger and if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you want to throw it away you have to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> book and it's normally like three weeks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> away yeah usually it's like a month so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> normally now I figured out genius Strat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> which is just break the thing down yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> below 30 seconds oh yeah yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> then you're good yeah yeah it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like uh you know how like in prison </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> movies right when they when they escape </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> from prison that they start dumping the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> soil one like one by one yeah in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> courtyard or something yeah it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right you gotta you gotta break this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> wall this cabinet into like small pieces </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and slowly recycle it every week </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember because like I remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seeing like I would go take the garbage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out and one day I'd saw like the bottom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> offs like the Wheels part and I'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like why is I'm just getting rid of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> the [ __ ] Wheels part and then next </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> week I go go go to put the garbage again </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's like the seat then this is and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then it's the sea eat and I'm like oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> someone's just playing junk with office </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> chairs and then next week hold it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> the backrest it's slow but it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> offensive it's the exact reason why I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bought a saw I'm not kidding I bought a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sword just to Source [ __ ] oh yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> don't have to deal with that I had like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of wooden [ __ ] and I'm just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not paying to get rid of this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] wooden playing I'm just gonna </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> saw this yeah it's also annoying because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you have to you have to measure it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly yeah yeah and if it's even a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> little bit off though they won't take it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you need to wait another three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> weeks and buy those stupid sticker </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> things again I don't I had like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> metallic like coat hanger or a coat rack </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah kind of thing and of course it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like way too big even if I took the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> parts off so what did I do I I put it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back up I put it on my balcony and just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let the weather wear it down as much as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> possible so the point where I could just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> snap it in here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I just want to rust to [ __ ] and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> grab the saw or like just snap it in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> half to the size I'm like perfect just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> let nature take its course </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> erosion like three months later I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like all right I can finally see the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> worst way to recycle something but I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> have respect I respect the the the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> effort you'd go to to not deal with the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> beauty yeah yeah dude it probably would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have taken just as long to [ __ ] book </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> a time to throw this [ __ ] coat hanger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out I just don't want to deal with it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know I just or I just wait for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> someone to come over and be like do you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> want this shitty thing I don't need just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> take it dude it made me feel like such a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bastard for you for using batteries like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I just I just want to use some double a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> batteries yeah and they make it seem </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I I was like like using like some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of radioactive material the way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're gonna get rid of it I'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> what's wrong with me yeah I don't think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've ever like properly gotten rid of my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> batteries right because I'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay I'll get rid of them next time the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other time um so I have like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> draw just full of like two batteries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> used dead batteries that I've not been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> able to get rid of because I've always </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> draw an existence yeah I'm sure we've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got a whole draw full of batteries </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Sydney go and grab a pair none of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are working gone that's all you should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> do is like a joke just be like just get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> one like actually working better and put </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it in that draw and being like there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one way battery </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean I'm getting special I'm gonna get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rid of it someday but just like I I just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> keep </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> getting rid of the batteries </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's one working battery you have 15 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> minutes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> find the working battery </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my God yeah I don't really use a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of batteries but for a lot of the uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> filming stuff that we have yeah it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> basically all for the filming because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that's all for like yeah Mike's camera </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> accessories it's all batteries it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really annoying because you have to get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> batteries for that and it kind of sucks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like get rechargeable ones yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but I always forget to recharge yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah but then if you get rechargeable </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ones you forget to recharge the before </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the shoots which is yeah and luckily you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> can buy AAA batteries like everywhere </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah man so yeah pretty good for that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's pretty good always always done well </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_07> they yeah I was surprised when they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> announced that they were making a movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just because it felt like it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> wrapped everything up yeah I was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> we're done aren't we yeah also it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> weirdly seemed like I didn't think it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was as popular on the surface did you </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_06> know I thought I told you I finished it </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_07> an anime Joey what the [ __ ] I liked it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah I liked it it was good but yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> again like I was surprised not only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> because yeah as as you said like the the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Show wrapped up nicely where it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how are they gonna make a movie out of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it but also it's like I don't know I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel all taxi was one of those shows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where like it got really popular from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Word of Mouth yeah where like is it like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like did it really get that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> popular to Warrant a movie that's what I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> know how popular it got because I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> remember when I made my video on it I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> was just like I made it because no one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> was talking about it yeah right at all </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and uh I thought it was kind of like The </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Underdogs everyone who watches it I know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> likes it yeah yeah yeah right sure but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's the thing it's like it's one of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> those shows where like I feel you start </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watching it because someone who gave it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> a go was like it was really [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah I feel like it had a similar Arc to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> uh made in Abyss because when made in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> the best came out it just no one was was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watching Maiden the best at all because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone saw the art style and everyone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> was just like oh this is children </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> children show which uh couldn't be more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> further from the truth honestly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> um but then like there's a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> children in the show I mean yeah it is a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> children's show in some sense yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's one for the kids one for the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> whole family they can relate the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> children's conversations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> um but yeah I mean like it it kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like that was another show that really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> spread through word of mouth and then it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eventually like it won like anime of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> year the year it came out yeah uh odd </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> taxi I feel had a similar thing where it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't really have much promotion or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything like that at least not not that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could see outside of Japan in Japan it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually had some kind of decent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> promotion because every time I remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when it was airing every time you go in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a taxi they would have an odd taxi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> advertisement today yeah yeah did you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not see no I didn't like they'd always </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> have it like playing </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> and it left an impression on me whether </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I enjoyed it or not oh that sounds like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> something else yeah I I've watched it </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> because I remember watching the first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three episodes of Sunny Boy I thought it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was boring as [ __ ] I thought it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> boring as [ __ ] this is like if you this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is like this is like holy [ __ ] I'm gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be like this is like [ __ ] our house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] pretentious [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> um and then like the soundtrack got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recommended to me and I'm just like holy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah this soundtrack just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like is everything I want it's like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of soft rock alternative rock in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> soundtrack yeah if you listen to some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> tracks I'm just like I kind of want to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> watch a show just because it's yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> soundtrack I found it because I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> buying a bunch of vinyls and yeah on the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> front page of the store the online store </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that I go to buy my vinyls it just would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> not leave the front page and I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what is this sunny boy thing so I went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> onto YouTube real quick looked up one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> song and I was like yep sold yeah right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah right and that's like the best </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> thing I could say is like the soundtrack </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just sets the vibe of the anime okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah where it's less about the plot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> points and it's more about the feeling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it gives you did you end up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> finishing it oh yeah I did end I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> finishing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um I mean like I I finished it and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't know what to think about it but I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I knews like some of the ideas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> presented in sonny boy it's just kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's one of those shows that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know exactly what you think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> immediately but the like I I just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember some scenes so it's kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like fully Coley in that sense yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of kind of like fully cool right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> right where it's just like fully cooly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Donny darker that kind of thing where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> you watching you're like I don't really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know what I watched but some parts of it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just really stick with you and just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> refuse to leave right that's how I feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with sonny boy yeah okay do you think it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> deserves to be nominated for an anime of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the year I don't think you deserve to be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> nominated for anime of the year didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it win like the Reddit one though like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> the Reddit yeah yeah of course </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it won the hot house pretentious one the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Reddit it's not not the user not the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> user the critical oh my God </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> which [ __ ] which doesn't help which does </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> not help its uh image at all yeah the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Reddit armchair critics uh gave it the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> the award for like anime you know I hate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> bashing on low-hanging fruit but yeah I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> mean there is sometimes normally an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> indication yeah like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah I mean like you know whenever I say </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> like Donnie dog is one of my favorite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> movies I'm I'm waiting for it like I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like dangling the low hanging okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> he's normally that guy yeah in our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> podcast is like the pretentious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> did you like it immediately no yeah no I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I only liked it maybe after like my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> second or third viewing sort of young </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when I watched it yeah yeah exactly yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that was the problem like when I first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watched it I was like maybe like 13 14 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> years old right and when you was when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you watch those kinds of movies at 13 14 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't know what the [ __ ] going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all you think is oh creepy bunny wow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but then I watched it again when I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like 17 18 which is like the peak of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> pretentiousness well when it comes to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> consuming media I definitely had that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Facebook yeah do you understand Lonnie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Darko only after I watched like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> load of like analysis videos on it right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> uh but like I had a I had a friend who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recommended me Donnie Darko during like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> high school or like Middle School uh who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like a massive fan of it so like he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would tell me like his theories yeah on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it and we would kind of like bounce off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ideas and I'm like I found that I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the reason why I like a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> those kinds of media because it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when you have another person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like a group of people like discuss </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it and like kind of like theorize and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hypothesize like oh this might be this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or this might be that whatever right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that's kind of fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and then you know once you actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like sit down and like read into what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's actually about according to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Creator or whatever then you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> realize oh it's not as deep as all these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] pretentious critics made it out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to me my favorite thing is when uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people like speculate about media and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff and then the Creator is like no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's not it and then they're like no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> no no no I don't think you I don't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> you understand what you did I think it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> actually this shirt that's literally </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's literally like no no no no no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah my theory is right please uh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> no I mean yeah I I I think there's anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that don't appeal to me as much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> unfortunately yeah no and I totally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> don't blame it no like it doesn't even </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> appeal to me it's just like I I had to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> be I have to be like in in a really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> specific mood that comes along once a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> year or once every two years where I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> just like I just want to watch something </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and just not understand it and make me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> feel things I mean the thing I like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about this podcast is that the viewers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> can like align their who they trust's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> opinion on a show based on what type of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> media they like right right so if you if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you get if you're like more to me I'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like and I'm like I don't like 86 and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like you shouldn't then trust my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> opinion for other anime right yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I I that's like that sheriff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> weirdly is like people are obsessed with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it and I just didn't enjoy it and I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't know anything about the series I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> didn't know anyone's talking about it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah I just didn't like it yeah but I I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> think it's like I think part of being a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> good critic uh at least or like or talk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like on the online at least or part of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being a good critic is acknowledging </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you have taste because people look </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at like people who talk about media </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> online and they should be like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> should be able to judge every single </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> piece of media objectively equally you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know you could you should be able to be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> able to judge them with no bias and I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like that's complete [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you're not a [ __ ] robot yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like when I look at you know for example </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like donkey for example when I look at </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> one of his video game reviews I know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly what his taste is and that gives </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me a better perspective than a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] IGN reviewers right because at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> least one one donkey like I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recently like I saw his review of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Horizon forbidden West and like he like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he didn't like he completely okay he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like he's shocked not not completely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like compared to some jrpgs yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah but like I I saw his criticisms and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was just like wow that this is like I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> can completely understand why he feels </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this way and I could and like but me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> knowing what kind of gaming games I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> understand and that gives me a better </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> perspective of what this game is like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> compared to to a lot of other critics </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah I would say like the best critics </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> online are the ones where you continue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to keep watching even though you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> disagree with most of their opinions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah just because like they because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their opinion holds like even though you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't agree with it they explain it and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're articulate enough and they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> honest enough with what they like and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fact that you know there's no way to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> completely get rid of bias with anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and and they own that and you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well you know I I knew before coming </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into this review that you are probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going to think a certain way about it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I might not agree with it but I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> respect the fact that you can still </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> stick to this yeah because it's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like probably everything I like in a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> game Conor's gonna complain about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> exactly it's just like I you know and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> vice versa probably yeah yeah and and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> vice versa you know but that just comes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with our taste and games yeah and that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> fine it's the same could be said about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> anime and stuff yeah I think I cut you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> off there no no no no no no I didn't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> want to know what I was gonna even gonna </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> say yeah yeah I took Avengers is okay I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> really like the first half and then it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> got really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and now he's going to have Tokyo </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Avengers fans on his throat tiger </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Avengers was like I saw the first four </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> episodes and I'm just like this is a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> read the Manga show like I definitely </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> felt that you know what I mean like like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like a fight at the end have you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watched all of any anyone watched all of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it here I I watched the first like two </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> episodes there's um there's a fight that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> goes on for like nine or [ __ ] nine or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> eight episodes at the end and it is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> the dumbest fight I've ever seen in my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> life that sounds like some eyes and [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> dude it's like it's like it's like just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> constantly it is literally the fight of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weight there's more yeah like something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happens wait there's more yeah wait </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's more and it's like this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> stupid just just [ __ ] resolve it this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is ridiculous this isn't Dragon Ball </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> fight story has been somewhat concise </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah they drag on a little bit here and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there yeah they have had some long </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fights but never more than four or five </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> episodes I think it was just it just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> felt like this last fight in particular </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just took the absolute piss yeah so the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> point where I was like this is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stupid yeah and yeah I had a good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cliffhanger but like the the last I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so bored for like four episodes but it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> doesn't matter man all the characters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are hot as [ __ ] but like according to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the fan base one of these characters and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like yeah I like some of the characters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in the show but my God there's so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of them insufferable and like I I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh God I mean I like the show I thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was good but [ __ ] man I felt like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> just it like they like blew its load and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then it just like is it even over is it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> even over no it's not over it's not and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel like where they left it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty good and it might it might pick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up but like it just felt like every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> single time something happened it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh my God there's more oh my God </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> there's more I don't know like I know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is gonna sound really unfair and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is totally my bias but like I I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> think I only managed to make it through </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like the first two or three episodes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I immediately saw what kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> theming they were going for with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> story you know like just like a bunch of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> dudes just like you know fighting you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know you know it's weird as well good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff but in my I I hate the fact that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the moment I knew where the story was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> heading in my head I was immediately </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd just rather read Bucky to be honest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I was kind of pissed off as well that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like all of these kids are like 13 14. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I was like why not why just just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> make them 17. it would make this story </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> makes so much more sense but here's the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thing isn't it weird that you felt that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about that show and yet you see hanaya </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mccolder who's 14 years old you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> perfectly understandable have a nice day </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because it makes it for some reason it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like it checks out like I'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't doubt it right because backy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> never asks me once to like actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> believe this world is a real world yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it just completely is like listen bro </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> this is literally like the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> equivalent of an Internet Forum like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> debate where like can Goku beat saitama </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like that is like it never once asks you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> to be invested in this world that's true </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whereas like Tokyo Revengers for me felt </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it was trying to it was trying to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get me to get invested in the gangs and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the culture and stuff but at the same </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> time how are you gonna make me believe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that this is how 13 year old and 14 year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> olds react that they like that they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drive by motorcycles they do all this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] and it's like they're willing to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like Rob and kill each other listen if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you made these kids 18 they can still be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> in school yeah although this would still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> make sense yeah and it's like just just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> do that wow that's like that's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> basically 90 of anime where it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> they don't need to be that age because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> nobody actually their age actually acts </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> like them this is one where I actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> felt like it was to a massive detriment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that they were like super young and this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> every single plots </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not so unbelievable but like it made it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> so to the fact that you're like it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> constantly asking you to just have this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> level of disbelief right yeah to give it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> like okay I guess this is how 14 year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> olds would react and respond to this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> situation and it's like just just add on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> four years they're still in school this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can work in college it all still works </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the universe totally works it can work </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if when you're an adult as well yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and now they can ride motorcycles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no question about it this is in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah no one is breaking the law injury </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> people don't even like they they the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> only law they break is stealing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> umbrellas that's literally it that's all </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they do they don't do it that's what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they do yeah no one is gonna how the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] are they gonna get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel like when I like the last time I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> felt that like when when I felt like the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> characters just weren't acting their age </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> at all uh was when I watched a race </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> was just like man these five year olds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how old were they like they're like nine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> they're like nine year olds acting like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like three they're like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she's in the forms of Relativity and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> quantum mechanics we can actually </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> predict when we were really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> they were like more capable than like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like like veteran detectives in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> force and all this [ __ ] and I'm just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like bruh these are like nine year olds </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and they're acting like that's what it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> does that's why I just couldn't get into </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a race this is the exact same thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> where I'm like this nine-year-old like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> girl is like solving Mysteries that like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] 30-year veterans </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I know we've ranted about this before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and that we've we've you know we've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> talked all about the age and stuff and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> do understand that like a lot of shows I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't give a [ __ ] like it's totally fine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's fiction whatever it doesn't matter </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah but like again there are some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> shares like a race where I feel like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> doing this is just completely to the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> detriment of the show and it makes you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> send suspend belief Beyond Reasonable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Doubt yeah I don't know there's a lot of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the shows where I'm like this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> just stupid I mean like there's also </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> like your line April as well where a big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing that took me out of the show is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I feel like they're in middle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> school or something right I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they're 14 yeah 15. but like everyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> talks like a [ __ ] poet you know you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> know everyone everything the writing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> needs to match the Apes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't give a [ __ ] if you put them in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the school yeah you've got to write 13 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> year olds like 13 year olds so Corsair </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> was talking like [ __ ] Mozart was back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you know and it's like dude you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should be you're 15 when I was 15 all I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was thinking about was poo poo peepee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like that's all I think about that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's all I think about now you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like you are you you always way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> more sophisticated than you should be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> for a 15. like this this guy like came </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> out the womb speaking in sonnets and all </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> this [ __ ] like he was studying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Shakespeare by the age of three like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Michael like my my God like that that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> took me out so much and uh it was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> small thing but it was just like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could have easily made them at a higher </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> age to make them feel like they were you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know they had the ability to speak like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this but it was just they were 14 years </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> old and yeah that was that was the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> biggest thing that uh just it's annoying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so sometimes it shows where like they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> write the characters like 17 year olds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they act and talk like 17 year olds they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they behave like 17 year olds why not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just make them [ __ ] 17. that's that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> why I think to this day the most perfect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> example of like a perfectly aged uh and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you know a character's acting age </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> appropriate in a super realistic way was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> golden time because it was like they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were in college and yet they were super </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> immature like most college students yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know like that's that's a realistic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> character that's why I love golden yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's why that show was so good and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it was so immersive because it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah I I know people who are like this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you're such a breath of fresh air to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> have say in college yeah yeah but they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> were acting more like high school </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> students than most high school students </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> were you know in other shows and it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like that's so [ __ ] ironic yeah like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's what I feel like that's why to me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> even now golden times like one of my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> favorite romances in all of anime just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just because it actually felt like these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> were believable characters set in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> world that felt like it was based in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> reality yeah not in this anime world </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where 15 year olds 15 year olds are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> doing quantum physics 15 year olds are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> doing quantum physics </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um like [ __ ] I mean you look at </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] like Naruto and Sasuke like they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Hunter Hunter was another one where I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> felt like they got the characters ages </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like actually reflected their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> personality you know yeah like gone was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> an idiot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like he he would like be convinced to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff by strangers like a child like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 13 year old unfortunately no no one over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the age of 18 is hanging out with hisoka </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I mean let's be honest for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> good reasons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone's like oh he's talking to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> okay I'll talk back you know I mean like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I I appreciate it when shows like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> actually treat the characters like they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> right yeah pissed me off because like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of people like for example Naruto </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like a lot of people forget that like in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the OG Naruto they're like he's like 10. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're 11 and 12 years old yeah and and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you you look at some of the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they go through like Sasuke's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to Revenge his entire [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> plan at the age of 11 11. he's he he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right he's doing that right this man's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> listening to too much my chemicals </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll avenge my [ __ ] Big Mac if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> someone slaps it out of my hand so I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> believe that actually I was a very most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> realistic character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no I don't know man I just I just kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of wish that it would it would it would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> change a little bit and then you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that was one of the main reasons why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I I was was a bit harsh on Tokyo </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> adventures and that's why I got it more </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> annoyed at it because it felt like it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> was just getting stupid right now I mean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know if I'm just like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've just seen so Adam so much anime </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that I'm just like immune to this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> but just like it's it's I it's it's very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rare that a character his age really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comes into like any kind of specific </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plot point or any bearing on the plot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> itself because there's no like it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hard to tell a character's age and Anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> based on just their looks and their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actions because the range the range of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Anime characters from like 13 to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> 28 yeah they they all look the same and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> they all act the same it's it's almost </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like kind of like Japanese people in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> real life isn't it maybe that's why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> right they turn into adults yeah like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you look at it like you look at like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Japanese girl and you're like you can be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 12 or 30. did you see this one I'm kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> of afraid to ask as well for the Tokyo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> uh Revengers they had to they mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> uncensored version </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> um where because they used a Sim the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> temple symbol a lot oh unfortunately uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> he's you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and uh really unfortunate and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they just that's a sense of that they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> sent they made a censored version where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they just don't use the symbol in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> title </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah it's weird in some ways I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I mean I feel like they didn't need </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to do that but I also kind of get it why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> they wanted to be careful yeah I don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know yeah I mean I I can see why they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> did that it's uh it's unfortunate but I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mean with how international anime is now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of people could have taken it the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wrong way also maybe a good a good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> moment to learn about another culture </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you'd be like what the [ __ ] I'm gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Google is this okay you know to me when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that when I first saw it I was like whoa </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you Google it you're like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah oh okay it's only been assemble </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's been around for like a lot longer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's very important did they censor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a narrator as well because I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like neji's like Clan symbol that he had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> on his like forehead or something was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> originally based on that I believe I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> don't there's a lot of shows that I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> think use those symbols and yeah because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it means like like uh yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's yeah it's a Buddhist right it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very unfortunate dichotomy of uh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> is that the anime verb what is that the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> anime version of the Manga version it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was the enemy bit okay so so the manga </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what was the Manga version of that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah they made a whole version where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they they added it and then a whole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> nother version where they just went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through and got rid of it yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really odd yeah never mind all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> violence I feel like if you're just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna get rid of it just get rid of it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah I mean it's not gonna be a bit it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> not gonna be that big of a deal but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> actually here's the uncensored one for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> you cultured interviews out there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> actually culture in a different in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different religion yeah yeah so like in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the manga yeah it was legitimate yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah that's what I thought that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what I thought so yeah it was I get it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> if you want to avoid the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> misunderstanding I get it yeah have the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> awkward guys we promise not a Nazi it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the same thing with the Google Maps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> oh yeah yeah because on Google Maps they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> use that symbol to mean uh I have that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> on mine I'm in English Google Maps oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really yeah it's there yeah yeah maybe </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> in other other languages I'm I swear to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> God I'm on my on my Google Maps in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> English I still see the the symbol oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> was like what is this on the Google Maps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> maybe if you're like not in Japan yeah I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like it's it's on the person who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comes to Japan to educate themselves </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of yeah because they're the ones </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that are going to throw a hissy fit and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> look like an idiot yeah like I said it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> a very unfortunate thing obviously with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> whom Japan Allied themselves with yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can understand why the mistake might be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> made it's scary how 45 degrees changes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> everything you know right it's just a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> slight shift just completely changes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the power of angles do you still want uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> do you either want peace or you want </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something that's definitely definitely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the opposite of Peace </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Buddhism </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Buddhism doesn't actually distinguish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between the orientation and like which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> direction the swastika's facing is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> technically all of them are mean the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> same right right right but yeah I mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> most people wouldn't know that though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah you know like obviously when I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> saw it I didn't feel like I was like oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> my God this I was just like oh what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> don't I know yeah clearly I'm missing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah I'd like to be educated yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly I felt exactly the same way I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> was just like that's it's weird seeing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that symbol but I'm sure they would not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> be there's a good reason I'm sure they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> wouldn't be putting that symbol if there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> wasn't enough for that yeah I'm sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these 13 year old get uh these this gang </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is not into that I mean I mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I I mean I know it's a gang see if only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone on the internet thought you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> know had rational thinking like that you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> know and instead it was immediately like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> oh how dare you we've said it a number </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of times people aren't willing to give </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the benefit the doubt people anymore </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that that's that's gone out the window </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> in the end of the year 2022 so also they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> forget that different cultures have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> different backgrounds and histories </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that's what's strange is that people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> really want to give benefit the doubt to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the country or even hide behind the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> country's flaws uh when it's convenient </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for them yeah but when they don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> understand something they're like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> well you know what I mean I don't know I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> don't know they should have explained it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> better anyway keeping on anime I guess I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> guess I guess since since I finally get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to talk about anime come on uh I guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh it's like I didn't actually watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much anime this previous season because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think there was actually much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> good things oh God don't say that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone get angry there's no good anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm 2021 well I think 2026 has been a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> pretty weak year for anime so far but I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> don't like I yes like the only real </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> recommendation I would have since you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> were going through like last year uh is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> uh ranking of Kings that's literally the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> last one I've been meaning to watch oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I've done with last year I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's continuing on to this year so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> last last year was it I mean it's a 23 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episode show so last year we only had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like 12 episodes oh I mean I guess I'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just wait then yeah I'll actually wait </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> till it's finished yeah I mean it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> almost finished but uh I feel like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> only going to be a part one of the story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah ranking Kings is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> incredible I've heard it's amazing yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> unironically a lot of people like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know Maiden best didn't watch it because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they looked like a children's cartoon no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I also didn't I didn't I I also didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watch it because it looked like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> children's cartoon initially but it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of like a it's kind of like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> closest thing to like a Ghibli movie I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guess in terms of like aesthetic yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I I really don't like Ghibli movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but it kind of gave me that kind of you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> know you know when you're like watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> an anime fairy tale that yeah it feels </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like that's like I I can only point to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Ghibli that gives you that same kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feeling but that's the kind of feeling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's giving me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but it also is written really really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] well like it's been a while </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> since I've seen just an anime just this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well written and with characters this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interesting as well damn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um it's like it's like to me like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spring season no sorry the winter season </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like basically Attack on Titan and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> demons layer everyone was like talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about yeah but like to me ranking of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Kings is like close to that level of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> quality in my opinion or just like how </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> good the show is I mean there's also my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> dress up darling as well there's also my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> dress up darling but that like that that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> occupies a different space in my opinion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you know it's a different faction that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a different faction yeah sure there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> the there's the attack on Titan Demon </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Slayer like core and then the [ __ ] my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> drones darling all the way over here </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah which is like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was surprising to see like in in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Japan my ranking of Kings has really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like shot up in popularity I think I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> think it's like the most watched anime </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> right now it's because there's a lot of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> voice actors who are saying how good it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> is so like they're like they're all like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah this is really fun there's a lot of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> power here yeah yeah they do I mean the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> top tier celebrities here I mean yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they're just like they're not even just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> voice actors here they're just actors </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> with uh celebrities they're just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> select going to celebrity status as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that's why they can make uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> questionable decisions like hanazawakana </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> selling nfts you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> which uh I saw that and I was like this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> has to be a joke and then I watched the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> video I was like please say psychonicana </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> please and then I saw a lot of people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are like no no I'm sure it's just a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> management I'm sure it's just her </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> management yeah and I'm like yeah but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like but she agreed to it yeah someone </SPEAKER_06>
