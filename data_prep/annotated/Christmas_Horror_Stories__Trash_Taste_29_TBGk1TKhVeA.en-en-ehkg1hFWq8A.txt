<SPEAKER_01> - So my son's left cookies and milk, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on his bedside table. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How do I tell him that
Santa is lactose intolerant? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So do I just drink the milk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and take the shits for my son? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well...
- Do I leave it there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and break his heart? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember one time my dad was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "No no, no Connor, Santa likes beer." </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.

<SPEAKER_04> - Do Americans have Boxing Day? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Meilyne, do Americans have Boxing Day? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] What do you mean Boxing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, no they don't have boxing day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Boxing day is the day
after Christmas Day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] It's not
anime so I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, that's true.
(thuds) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So they maybe riding on the on the thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Both] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, the box is fine,
so you can open it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Both] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But they maybe writing
on the thing in Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Joey, ignore it don't read it, just. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, I wanna look at the box. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, so you can, just open the box now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but when inside, I think
they'll be a label on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Just don't read the label, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay.
- Garnt it might be in kanji. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you should...
- Okay, well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't read anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just rip it open.
- So I'm all good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey shrieking) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, to explain what Boxing Day is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> isn't Boxing Day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the actual day you're meant
to open your presents? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't that why it's called Boxing Day? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that what it is called? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think that's why
it's called Boxing Day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was just the day you
ate all the leftovers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was told Boxing Day was like an event, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where everyone boxes it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it's a little music box. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So don't open yours yet, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't, you might wanna
play it up to the microphone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay.
- Everyone needs to be silent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (music box winding) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let me play this.
- Guess the song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, guess the song. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> Yes. Oh my god, thank you so much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor chuckling)

<SPEAKER_02> - I think I know exactly
where he got this from. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> All right, I'm not gonna look

<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, don't look at the labels Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (music box winding) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I got Joey something too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, I have to
wait for yours to shut up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, wait, let's

<SPEAKER_02> (bell chiming)
(Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, that just stops it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Huh!
- I think it just stops it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (bell chiming) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Meilyne] I can't hear it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can hear it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (singing in foreign language)

<SPEAKER_00> Fucking, that's also your name, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the same band, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's Radwimps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's the ending, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause Joey always sings
this song in karaoke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so it's a... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't sing this one in karaoke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you know what I fucking did? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, I sing a fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I sing Zenzenzense mostly. </SPEAKER_01>

hear in the background, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's just going on now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I shouldn't have winded it so much. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] And you can (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> Did you have boxing day in Australia? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just so... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if the mic is picking that- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is loud as fuck in this room right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I know exactly

<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I bought one as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, did you? </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> - This is an awesome gift though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah there you go.. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> - You're welcome boys, thanks for my gift. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thank you very much.
(Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll get you a present soon don't worry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not like we literally just decided </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this was the Christmas
episode, the day of recording. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we didn't know this was gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> be the Christmas episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just thought I'd bring
a gift, I'll be nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Wow it's really going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just fucking going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It just keeps going, doesn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Meilyne, do you wanna have this for now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, do you wanna hold on to this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Just get it off screen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Meilyne] Okay, I'll
just put it outside. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Put on my desk,
- Yeah it's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just put on my desk it should be fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah but..
- It will turn off naturally, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't turn it anymore.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, just leave it, just leave it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Just let it sit on the
desk it will be fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, but I know exactly
where you got those from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you took a trip, didn't you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did, I went up to
Hokkaido, but it's all good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You should chill a little vacation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Just relaxing, it's nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every YouTuber needs a
vacation every now and again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and just eat all their
food, food's amazing there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I told you they've
optimized the food, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's good, man, it's good.
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's as good as everyone says it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You should go.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Go if you get the chance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are some like, specific
dishes that you had up there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that you would recommend to
people who wanna go to Hokkaido? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anything with milk in
it is just like the best. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Does it meet the hype?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I've heard so
much about Hokkaido milk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and what is so good about the milk there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the breed of cow... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know it's rich, it's real rich. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like full cream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I had like a milk ice cream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't normally like milk ice cream, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was just like,
intense milk hit you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor sighing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I saw you posted a picture
of beer ice cream as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] That's like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just to prove that Japan does
every flavor of self serve. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why you'd
ever want beer ice cream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, there was like ice
cream, that was just beer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, I mean sure, I'll try it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I like both these things individually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even alcoholics will like that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah this will be good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It tastes like shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't imagine a beer flavored
anything aside from beer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and it tastes... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like a musky ice cream. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's the weirdest
flavor ice cream you've had? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Rum ray, am joking.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - How dare you? Probably the beer right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably the beer right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I've normally, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've had fish ice cream before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh,
- What, where, Japan? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Japan.
- Oh, that sounds disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it was like a salmon ice cream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt exclaiming)
Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They do that shit here with food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like, I don't
care about the boundaries. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I like both these things
let's make it into food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like the equivalent of fucking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what some Americans do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like buying of McFlurry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then just dipping it with fries. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, but I...
- Which just blows my mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, but actually I kind of like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why?
- What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's pretty good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I went to, fucking Oki took
me to a Steak n Shake once, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> which is where like, the optimal
place of where you do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I just saw like six
Americans dipping their fries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into the shakes, I'm just like, I can't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't be here, I have to leave. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're living in a
first world country dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckling)
Why are you eating like this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, like, I don't do it often </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it tasted pretty
good when I've done it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't get it, it's like a nice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the synergy of the
saltiness of the fries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and the sweetness of
the shakes, I'm like no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't understand why it
works, it just does, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It doesn't though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also Steak n Shakes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there the most depressing
place in America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I went to one at midnight,
'cause I was like, yeah... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe because you went at midnight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was $1.50 burgers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was just like, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, you've never
been to a White Castle before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's true depression. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never been to
a White Castle before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Does it meet the hype? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - White Castle, the hype of what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I only know White Castle
because of that one movie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's it? Harold and
Kumar or something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah.
- And... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, White Castle doesn't sell
burgers, they sell sliders. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, so it's like the tiny buggers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's the difference
between a burger and a slider. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a mini burger, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A slider is just like a
mini burger, apparently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know where it comes from. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But basically they sell
sliders instead of burgers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like normally, right,
like when you buy a slider, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you go to some American restaurants. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I like meat, like my
chicken Parmesan sliders, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that shit's bomb... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They don't say it like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What?
(Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Parmesan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Parmesan sliders. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, what do you say? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the way you added that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Chicken Parmesan sliders.
- Parmesan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Parmesan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just call it Parmesan, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Parmesan?
- Parmesan yeah, Parmesan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh dude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that hurts me hearing that.
- British man's language. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Alright go ahead then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anyway, that chicken, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my favorites are chicken
Parmesan sliders right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's like the chicken Parmesan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you put like some lettuce in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fucking nice, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but White Castle slider is
literally just two soggy buns, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the thinnest patty in existence. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
(Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like paper thin patties. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's pathetic.
- Oh God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you can get like a six pack of... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Six pack of sliders.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's like a six, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they box it like a six pack of
sliders for $4 or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, "This is true depression." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - All I know is that everyone
I know who goes there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has like the shits afterwards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me that's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how on earth we've got to the point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where that's just an acceptable outcome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How is it that Americans have gauged </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the tastiness of a fast food joint, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> by how much this stomach is
just destroyed the next day? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - People are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, yeah it's not a good chili's meal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> unless I'm shitting myself
constantly the next day." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I feel the same with Indian though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to destroy the toilets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sure.
- After I eat Indian, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so I can kind of get it,
but at the same time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I can only do it, like at
most once every few weeks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like a burger shouldn't do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing)
A burger shouldn't... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Indian, I've always
accepted the Indian does that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because of the spices right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's all the spices, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's just like bread and meat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what is happening?
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What went wrong? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the oil. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> also the most egregious
thing that I hear they do, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that they put the grease
on top of the burgers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's disgusting.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who did this? And who likes it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I remember I
went to Steak n Shake, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they did this to my
burger, and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Well, I don't want this anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would you do this?"
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "It's like you took the
worst part of the meat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is the part that
makes you feel sick." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - "And you put it on top, why?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember when I
was staying at Sydney's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> family's house in Wisconsin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they got a takeaway
pizza joint one day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And one of the big selling points </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of this takeaway pizza joint,
is they had garlic bread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the selling point, was that
if you put a wet paper towel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the garlic bread, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it would literally soak it in oil. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they were hyping this up to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yo, if you put that, if
there's so much oil on this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That if you put the wet
paper towel, it will soak it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it will become completely wet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just thinking, "How
is this a selling point? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why would I want to eat this?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like that Simpsons episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when Homer is trying to get so fat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that he gets the disability like being, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And Dr Nick's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Grab the burger, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> rub it against the piece
of paper' (chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then go, see through, you can eat it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought it was like a joke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought it was satire,
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But no, they literally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like market it there, as
this garlic bread is so oily, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can literally soak up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an entire paper towel,
- That's disgusting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I just think about
it and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hold it in my hands and
it was literally dripping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I took one bite,
- That's.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And one bite was enough for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like the pure survival food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause the sheer amount of
oil, could power a lamp, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for like decades. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you ever heard of
this American burger joint </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> called the Heart Attack Grill? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, of course.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The fucking... I was
watching a video yesterday, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of this guy who ate the
the biggest one there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> which is called the
quadruple bypass burger, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's literally think of a Big Mac, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but stack six big macs on top,
- Yeah, I've seen it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it was like, I already thought that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like 20,000 calories as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This guy demolishes it in five minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how the fuck he did it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the part that got me
was, he was like alright, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we're getting to the bun
now, the bun by the way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is soaked in lard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like,
- [Garnt] Oh, disgusting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - "You shouldn't..." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's so veil. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "A piece of bread should
not be soaked in anything." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nothing should be soaked
in pure fucking fat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, also the fries were
oiled in pure lard as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's disgusting.
(Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you get a shake on top of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't understand the appeal of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's just ridiculous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just sounds gross. It looked gross. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It looked like something
out of the alien movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, why.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't wanna put that in my stomach. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why do people hate their bodies? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like...
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's only like
some, let's say cuisines </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can only enjoy when you
want to destroy your body. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's probably, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like at 3:00am,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - After like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - After five guys.
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - After five guys or like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I can never eat a kebab sober, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like something has got...
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something has gone wrong with me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like something has gone
wrong with my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> If I'm eating a kebab,
and I'm completely sober. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know I'm hella depressed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when I'm eating a kebab for lunch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love a great burger
with a bit of grease on it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a little bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Just a little bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But there's a clear line, that
no even drunk me would pass. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the Heart Attack
Grill to me is just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there is no reason why
I would wanna come here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other than to feel healthy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like and just look and be like damn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because any meal you have after, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to the Heart Attack Grill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You'll be like damn,
- But also you just stay there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you see the other
patreons and you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, I'm doing pretty good for myself." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, like damn, okay.
Maybe I am in shape." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I think the selling point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the Heart Attack Grill
is that, first of all, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, when you walk in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they put on like a hospital gown on you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they sit you in a
wheelchair, to wheel you in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And here's the kicker, if
you weigh over 300 pounds, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get the meal for free. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like it should be the opposite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You should be like, it's
like taxing the rich right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you're already fat, you
should be charging at least, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling)
[Both] Double. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - To force you to maintain,
this egregious weight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like the concept
of Heart Attack Grill, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just kind of like, if you you hear it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like, this
is like fiction, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> This is from like some dystopian society. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, this is from
like some George Orwell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So this is how they fatten you
up, before they dispose you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know when we watch this
like 500 pounds life videos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, 600 pounds life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That one whatever, you watch it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you realize that most of
these people just have trauma. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like at what point do we start like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, maybe it's not trauma, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if he's walking into
the Heart Attack Grill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe that's on him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt chuckling)
You know what I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that there's going
beyond a point of comfort food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's gonna be like,
this is just his fault. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because this shows, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these videos with these 600 pound people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> do you really fucking good job </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at making you feel sorry
for them and be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yo' man, okay yeah, like
his parent died at five. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Yeah, eating disorder. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For some reason, at the age of five, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> his mama is taking him to
the Heart attack Grill, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's the only way
that she can remember him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, I get it."
(Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I sympathize with you, but should you?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause it's like, what
if my parents were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's all have had since the age of 10." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> would I be doing crack </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would I be doing crack,
but it's just comfort. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey chuckling)
- It's comfort food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To me, it's like, there's a clear limit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the point where you're gonna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> alright, well, maybe I should
stop feeling sorry for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- That's just... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no, I never watch those
shows that like feel sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well 'cause I've noticed I watched them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they do a really
good job making you think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> damn, like I guess, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that could be me.
- Yeah they set up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the thing, they
set it up as a sob story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- But what you're seeing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and what you're hearing is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the complete opposite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Two different things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Two entirely different things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well I think, as so many
wished, a little chubbier, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not knowing in that level.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I get it, I get
how you can gain weight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But there's like a limit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of where I think, that it
would go beyond anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like some of these that, you dint like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know like fucking
15 hotdogs in the morning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with cheese and chili on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I would draw the line, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I can't (chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right yeah, but that's the thing... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The thing that surprises me more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is not the fact that there's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like complaining about having
all this weight problems </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they proceed to eat
a whole fucking box of chilies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's also just the egregious amount </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of food that they can somehow stomach. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, it just looking
at it makes my stomach hurt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just doesn't make sense to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I feel like you must have
like, just grown up with this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and because, every time I go to America, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I always like the food portions in there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We've talked about this
before, are massive then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm forced to have to, have
these massive food portions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like the first week, fucking great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> After a week of staying in America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanna go home.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, is that salad? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I ask for the salad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and what comes out is a fucking forest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing)
You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> This aint a fucking salad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like six heads of lettuce. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The amount of dressing is
like the same as the meal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> its like 1600 calories. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, what of like a fucking rabbit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like did you deforest
the entire Amazon rainforest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just to put on my plate like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the kind of like free portions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we're talking about here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This sucks man, 'cause
it's such, it's so unfair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because if you get fat in Japan,
I feel like that's on you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey and Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But if you get fat
in America, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything was set up against you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Welcome to the system. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everything was set up to make you fat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it's like how the fuck,
it's not fair, which is why... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like my diet in America is awful, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously 'cause of the food there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I keep saying whenever I go there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But also, I get to the point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I want to have something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but something not greasy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and especially like in the
Midwest, where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the countryside, there's a lot less choice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a lot less healthy choices as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So, you're kind of forced to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey, you can have, to cook for yourself." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And if you can't cook for yourself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then you're pretty much fucked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey And Connor] Yeah.
- And that's why, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> its so much harder to
eat healthy over there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> than is, say like in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But even then in America,
I remember I went to the... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to Walmart, and I was like, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> lets get some healthy foods, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was really hard
to find the actual stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The actual healthy stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I go to the next
aisle, there's a whole aisle, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this blew my mind, of hotdogs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a whole aisle of hotdogs,
not sausages, hotdogs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like this is insane, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought there was
only one type of hotdog. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't realize that hotdogs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were any different from each other, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they all taste the same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Hotdogs never taste any different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you ever notice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you go to your
friend's barbecue, whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they give you a hotdog, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have you ever been like wow, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this tastes different from my hot dog? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
- No it's always like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I put mustard on that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's how you differentiate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They all taste the fucking same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it's all the different brands. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and somehow they had like 10 rows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on a whole aisle of hotdogs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was blown away, I was
like this is insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think like there is difference, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in sometimes it's filled with cheese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and sometimes... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's vile. Don't do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want-
- Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> No I like that.
- No, no because... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because this is American
cheese we're talking about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that's a real cheese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If it was filled with
actual like real cheese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> then yeah, I'd be a little open to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm pissed off they've managed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to infiltrate Japan somehow, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause whenever you get anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with cheese on top of it here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> its such a gamble, whether
its American, like fucking... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Plastic cheese, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fucking Americans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - See this is the advantage of not putting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> condiments and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can actually- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Taste the fucking difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between a normal hot dog
and the cheese hot dog </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because that's an important
life skill, isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, I know I can't differentiate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> between 10 different brands of hot dogs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because otherwise that's life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you just put condiments
on it all the time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> then it just tastes like
the condiments, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't get to taste the
softies and the difference. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Again its this energy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you think we are fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drowning out hotdogs and sauce. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, it looks kind of
looks like a lot of the times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jesus Christ.
(Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I gave you five
brands of generic hotdogs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would you be able to tell the difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between any of them? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I wouldn't be able to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean.
- That just sounds like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a Trash Taste special.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not that big of a fan of
hotdogs, but I mean I can... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is like a food like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if we gave you different types of it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you'd be able to differentiate? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt exclaiming) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Myelin] Not tap water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not tap water.
- Tap water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can differentiate between tap water </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and normal water, but not like say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not say like Voss water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't understand Voss water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck is Voss water? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you never heard had of Voss water? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
- It's like the.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> really, really posh water
that comes in a glass bottle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You can see it on screen now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's only at like-
- It's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really high class hotels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I've sampled one before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember 'cause it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was really, really thirsty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was the only water available, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it just taste like water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There is no difference
between the bottled water brands </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm convinced, and when
you watch how they, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> half of it comes from
the same fucking place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is just the normal taps, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that all the people are using in the area. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, dude you know what's
the one type of person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I'll never be friends with? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When someone will take a sip of water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, this is hard water, can
I get some soft water please?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> People like that... I know
people like that in California, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I knew someone who could
only drink a brand of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember which brand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Both] Evian. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally refused to
use any other water, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and if they used bottled water,
like in like cup noodles, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had to be bottled Evian. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Can you believe this.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I don't know man,
I don't like tap water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have gone through a phase where... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have got one million views on YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then this is what happens, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> he's like 'Only Evian on me'. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well I mean because is tap
water drinkable in the UK? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Both] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's drinkable in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Right.
- Where I live, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've grown up where every where in my life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tap water is sucked.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I've heard about this
mythical good tap water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that people talk about some of the times, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor is one of those people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Come to Australia bro,
we have great top water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've always had like, shitty tap water, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It depends, 'cause if
you get it from a quality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like this, to me this
clearly tastes like tap water, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause if I can taste
the sink in tap water, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> its like inferior water fro me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna taste something metallic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna... sometimes
I get the hard water thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause sometimes I drink
tap water and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel even more dehydrated- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd like a little picture.
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Than when when I first drank this water. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> - Thank you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thank you, to Raid for
sponsoring this video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like the best time to judge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how good water is, is
when you're hung over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause when I'm hung over, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there are definitely different levels, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel different levels of
hydration when I'm hangover. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I need, when
you're feeling like shits </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you want to feel re hydration again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's when like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I will stick by the bottled
water every time over tap water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean I will take tap water... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, I just drink a liter
of whatever is near me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh dude, if I'm like,
depending on how hungover I am, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll fucking drink a
liter of toilet water, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything to just get something
like fucking fluid in me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I know that's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have ever like (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have seen a Japanese
YouTuber do that before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Oh God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, well it go didn't
go out well though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh yeah, I don't know, I
guess maybe it's because, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> at least in Sydney bottled water is almost </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> non existent in Sydney. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because legitimately the tap water is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> as good as the ball water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And also bottled water in
Australia is fucking expensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, a bottle like
that big is like $4. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I only buy bottled water because I'm out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I can't just find a tap to drink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah no here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because bottled water is cheap, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but t's like 100 yen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so that it's a little bit more affordable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But in Australia, if someone was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, I'm just gonna go to the Woolies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What about water fountains? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you drink from water fountains? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I drink from water fountains </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when I am desperate enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It depends where. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it depends on where. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And how clean or dirty
that water fountain is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like a lot of this
has come up from my upbringing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> cause in Thailand, you
can't drink tap water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I've just gotten used to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like always buying bottled water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That makes sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, that makes sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do genuinely think
the taste of tap water </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tastes like shit where I am. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can taste the chalk where I... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No in Brighton.
- All right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- It taste really metallic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I am not a fan of the metallic taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean it was nice in Wales, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and here I felt it... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But in London is fucking salty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, London I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but then in London you're
getting that like cholera shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't trust the water in London </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean Wales is nice, the
quarry was right next to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like because,
I don't know how it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but everywhere I've been to
where it's like a big city. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Normally I don't... tap
water tastes like shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Countryside is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like if okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like if you're in a hotel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you're already thirsty, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do you go for the bathroom water? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Or do you go for the fridge minibar water? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where you pay for it? No fucking way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> am I paying for that water. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no I'm not paying that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause that's-
- He fucking did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The hotel bathroom
water is like the worst. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No dude,
- That's where I draw </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No dude, I'm never... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am never paying for water in a hotel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
(Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's ridiculous, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's ridiculous, it's like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like a hotel is the one place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that should not be allowed
to charge for water. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Am literally paying.
- Like you're already, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like you're already
charging the (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm paying for a basic necessity, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is just like being some where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're gonna charge me for water? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- No way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, for me, I genuinely can't taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the fucking difference
anyway, so if I'm like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shout out to hotels that give
out bottled water for free. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, shout out that you are the G's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I don't have to fucking
go through all the voss water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And not like just one
bottle they give you like four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're like go ham man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We refill them all every day.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the best is when you
come back from a day out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the bottles are like back, as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- That's the good shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - On the topic of food, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so with it being Christmas right now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and everyone just had
their Christmas meals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Mm-hmm. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What are your preferences,
in your Christmas meals? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because, I'll be honest, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so last year, we all
celebrated Christmas together </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we had a hot pot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - My mother traditionally left... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was it was a great
fucking hot pot but, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I aint gonna lie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it just felt like something was missing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's not there's
not the fucking turkey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and whatever... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I will say this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I think turkeys overrated as fuck, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't understand the hype behind turkey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think turkey is just
like an inferior chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like imagine chicken but
just drier with less taste, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just turkey.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't understand,
why all the holidays... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what it is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's someone who just got a turkey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just went into Photoshop and did this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like everything is
thinner, it's just bigger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think if you have
like a real nice turkey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's been like seasoned well you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's, I think it could
be better than chicken. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because like, the
problem with turkey is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if it's seasoned well, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You get the outer part,
that's nice and seasoned. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then you get to the
inner fucking drier... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why you gotta
cook it, you gotta cut it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a way you get the skin and
the bite in the same bite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you can do that with chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And with less price. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but I feel like
you can make a turkey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like skin taste better than chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, it depends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meilyne agrees, and you know Meilyne. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but Meilyne's American. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you like any other meats? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause sometimes my family
used to do like duck or ham. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like roast pork. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think all generally pork
is the best for Christmas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think all generally, pork
is the best for Christmas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and chickens like the
backup but I think... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really, I think a good
fucking ham is just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't beat that shit.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Define what you mean by ham, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> do you mean like roast pork or like ham? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You could do either, like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I don't really like ham, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like roast ham. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Does that guy like anything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's wrong with you?
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You sounded like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like a gammon steak. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Kind of like,
- Yeah, it could be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I'm not a fan of gammon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That's just like, the
inferior part of bacon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This man is not a fan of anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is literally the opposite. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It is literally the more expensive bacon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's literally what gammon is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never heard, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never heard, what is a gammon? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like meatier cut of the pig. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's normally more
expensive than bacon, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause bacon is the
cheapest part of the pig. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's shit and
gammon's like the actual... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I thank you very much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You been fucking brainwashed Garnt, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How are you gonna argue with me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that bacon is not the
best part of the pig? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the most overrated part of the pig. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We never used to eat bacon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Bacon used to be like the shitty part. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I literally know vegetarians
who have been converted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to meat eaters because of bacon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's the meme, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone says bacon is
like the best food, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's 'cause the smell of bacon, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just think bacon it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not that great like,
it's just kind of tastes okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially the American bacon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What the fuck are you talking about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - American bacon is... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - American bacon is the best bacon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, it's fucking awful.
- Oh, fuck off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the best bacon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck off, stop clapping Meilyne. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - British back bacon,
is like the worst bacon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Its the best way to have bacon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just don't love bacon period. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because right, normal
bacon is like 50 to 70%, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's more fat than.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm not saying it's healthy,
but I'm saying it tastes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like fat inherently just tastes like shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No it, if it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The meat is the best part. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> There's a reason why it's more expensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The one thing I don't like about bacon, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is that it is way too overpowering. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Especially when you put
it with other things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like if you have like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say like you put bacon
on a burger for instance, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of people love that shit, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But for me, when bacon is on a burger, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all I taste is the fucking bacon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I'd rather just have.. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd rather just replace
everything with bacon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and will taste the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the nice
condiment that you need, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the nice
condiment that you need. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like bacon on my burger, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because I don't eat any ketchup or mayo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or fucking whatever on my burger, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you don't know sauce or
whatsoever on your burger? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're a fucking clown Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I actually like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's probably why he likes turkeys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's like the driest fucking burger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This man's like water this, water that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want my bacon to be all fat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just give me the fucking fat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Give me the driest fucking burger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and non-tap water please that's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Streaky bacon is like far
beyond the better bacon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - What the fuck is streaky bacon? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Streaky bacon is the American bacon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay.
- So I didn't know how like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause whenever I... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So to Americans, British
bacon is similar to Canadian, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's the difference? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah to America, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To America, British
bacon is just like ham. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So British is more like 80-90% bacon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's like 10% fat on the edge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's like a thick (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Both] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like as a kid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would hate British bacon, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I would just like
eat the bacon parts first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because I would just like
eat the bacon part first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause that was the best tasty part, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause that was the best tasty part, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're actually disgusting,
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> cause it wasn't.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You would save fat and eat it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wasn't he wasn't the fat part, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was the fat with like the
little piece of meat in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I realized that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> American bacon is just all that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So American bacon is just like
the best part of the bacon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause actually, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We actually had a podcast for you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you sit here and tell
me you just wanna eat fat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You just want fat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm supposed to give a
fuck about your food opinions? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And this man doesn't eat
the crust on a pizza right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like the fatty part of a bacon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is literary the equivalent of how you've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> labeled crust on a pizza. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it's the fucking opposite, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the crust in the
pizza tastes like nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the most tastiest part of
the bacon, is the fatty part. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's why Americans have figured out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the best tasting part of the bacon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they've just
taken the streaky bacon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is the most tastiest part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and put it all in one.
- You're beyond saving. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We've lost this man,
- You're beyond saving, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've lost this man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're beyond saving, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If it's just the bacon
part, I've talked about this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the bacon part, is just to me like pork, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just vanilla beef. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> We've talked about this,
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unlike the only part that's better, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the fatty part of the pork. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like pork belly, pork
belly tastes fucking great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's mostly fat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You gotta.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, I admit, pork
belly is fucking bomb, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's 'cause..
- But that's because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and it's also not
a very like cheap pork. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Bacon isn't anything cheap. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Bacon is inherently cheap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's an expensive part of the pork. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The fat is good.
- It's because.. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the fatty content, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of the fatty content, that's
what gives it the flavor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause pork by itself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - (indistinct) with more meat added. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you get chunks where
you get a bit like half meat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But, that's like an actual
like richness to it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's chunky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just don't fuck
with the taste of bacon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And normally, pork belly
is not like on its own, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's normally included with other things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like in a broth or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whereas like bacon, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like you can have
it with other things, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but again, it just overpowers everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one makes a fucking
broth out of bacon, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that's just disgusting,
'cause it's shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> excuse me.
(Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Someone scrap that out please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When we spoke about the food episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we got really heated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like a day or two after Joey
was like, you know what Connor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, no, I thought about it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - See. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause in the food episode
as I agreed with Garnt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's better than pork. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But then I thought I'm like no wait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ton katsu, cuts it on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tonkatsu, katsuzen that's all pork. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe you can make a burger,
It's literally so limited, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that normally has meat,
is normally, pork block, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the other side of the fence here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and say pork, yeah.
- Oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't believe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The fact that you...
- 'Cause pork. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you like streaky bacon
over like actual meat, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just says the reason why you
can't appreciate good meat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - For me pork just tastes... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I rest my case your honor.
- Pork, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I rest my case your honor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pork, just tastes like well done beef. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God! Are you insane.
(shrieking) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - As we all know, nobody
fucking likes well done beef. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No Garnt, I'm getting a call right now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's from the circus, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's from the circus, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they want to they want to
know your address, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like what the fuck what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you're the entire circus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It tastes nothing like beef. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It tastes nothing like
beef. What are you on about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause the good, the
fucking best part of beef, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like the moisture, and like, it's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh duck is just a fatty chicken, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's all it is, man.
(Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like it's the same thing right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the same thing right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That's, they're not even
remotely similar in taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never ever... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every chef who is watching this episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every chef who is watching this episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just had a stroke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> There's just like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty realizes what a
fucking clown you are Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt chuckling)
- No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckling)
- No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sticking my corner man,
beef is superior to pork. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - This man literally,
- Except for bacon, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt out here literally arguing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> his fucking like kiddie
meal preferences and food, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretending is at the gourmet table, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like get out of here gourmet, come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Christmas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anyway going back to Christmas meals. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Going back to Christmas meals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I used to fucking hate Christmas meals, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause my parents used to make, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and they honestly they probably still do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking awful gravy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like jelly.
- Eewh! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like Christ
mas meals live and die </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> by the quality of gravy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's true, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because I used to eat all of
the components on their own. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah,
- Because I refused, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to eat my parents' gravy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the whole family was
like, "What's wrong Connor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Why are you doing it? It tastes good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What do you mean?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "No, the KFC
gravy, although not great, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tastes better than this shit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the consistency. Anything
that's jelly, I don't like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's like a perfect middle, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause if it's too jelly,
it's basically like a solid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It should be flake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But if it's like, I've had liquidity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the fucking... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Gravy should...
- There's nothing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> more depressing than watery gravy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know right, when
you pour that shit in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if it splashes, it's too... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It needs to like mold,
but not be like jelly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like fucking, I'm calling you out mom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> do you guys like eggnog? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> do you guys like eggnog? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have, I... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've tried it once, I am not a fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't have eggnog, Meilyne
just turned around and... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] Japanese eggnog? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Oh no.
- Meilyne just seems for eggs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She said Japanese eggnogs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She said Japanese eggnog. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but then like two Christmases
ago when I went home, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my aunt, like handmade eggnog, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you have that with like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, do you like custard? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's basically, think of
custard but it's a drink. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then my friend
introduced me to eggnog, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a fireball and usually
I don't fuck with fireball, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think fireball's overrated as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But that with eggnog
is like, It's so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Something like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can have an apple
pie and drink eggnog. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I like it with the solid to like help. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, that's why you have
it with the Christmas meal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've been trying to
find eggnog in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I fucking love that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I fucking love that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just, it just doesn't sound good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It just doesn't sound good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it doesn't sound
like, I'll try though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the word 'eggnog', </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the word eggnog, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is the least appealing sounding word. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It sounds like eggnog. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's sounds like a dirty porno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just think that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just think that.... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Eggnog nine. My favorite porn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just, I feel like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just, I feel like, 'cause
my family's like mega British. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I don't have the Christmas meals to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's probably this they
were 1000 years ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just people awkwardly sitting
around a table, being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yes, did you like your presents?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I did like my presents mother. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I did like my presents mother." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Should we open a cracker?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you have crackers in
Australia? Christmas crackers? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Thought you mean like
white people? Like yes we do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yes Connor... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We have many crackers in Australia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [All] (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You mean like on a cheese
platter and stuff like that or? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, those crackers?
- Yeah, Christmas crackers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like Christmas crackers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah with the ones with like little... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - With the ones with like little... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> The Christmas crackers that you pull? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that part of the American... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You both pull an end of this cracker, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and then whoever
gets the bigger half, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then whoever gets the bigger half, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> gets the shit inside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you have this?
- It's like a kinderek. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a kinderek but as a... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then there's little things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that like little plastic toys and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] And there's always
like one ready shit joke? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you have like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the paper crown. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And the paper crown. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's always a paper .
(Chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow, America doesn't have this, huh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No America doesn't have that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No America doesn't have that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but we... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Uncultured. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You pull one of those,
they're overpriced, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like $10 for a pack of 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt chuckling)
And it's shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When you're like five, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When you're like five, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like this is fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like death note
levels of like mind games, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then you realize... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got six crowns (chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got six crowns.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then when you start
cheating you realize that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because when you're, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because when you're the
one who's supposed to lose </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they pull </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they pull and you
realize it's not happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like fuck, I've been
called out, I've cheated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Both] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Apparently in America, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Apparently in America, it's not a thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] It's a thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- Is it a thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I heard, in some parts in
a lot of parts of America, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I heard, in some parts, in
a lot of parts of America, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hated them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I never got them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never got them either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't like the idea of being teased, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't like the idea of being teased, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for like 25 days on chocolate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like,
- It's not even a bar, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like a small amount. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To me advent calendars, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to explain advent calendars
for anyone who doesn't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So you get a calendar at
the beginning of December, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and every day you can open
up like a day of the week, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you get a different
piece of chocolate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - God these white people.
- And.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - God these white people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And unlike as as a kid,
(Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it was just like the equivalent
of know not November, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but just for chocolate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean?
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is the most blue balls of end, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like Christmas right?
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Is it a morning thing? Or
is it an evening thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought it was a morning thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - First thing in the morning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you go you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you go, it was like as a kid
it was it was the only time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you could eat chocolate,
first thing in the morning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was, but it was like
it threw off my vibe, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I was saying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why am I fucking eating
Chocolate in the morning? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause Christmas for us, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause Christmas for us, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is in like the middle of the summer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You buy it and it's just like the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you can see the chocolate kind of melting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> from inside the thing,
you just open it is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey guffing)
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are like the wooden ones? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - My parents would never fucking
buy me the expensive ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wooden advent calendars?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wooden advent calendars? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the traditional... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The traditional wooden, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The traditional wooden, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like the traditional
advent calendars I've seen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you open this like wooden door, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to open the chocolate.
(Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - My mom refused to pay
more than a $1 for mine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- So she would always, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wait until December 4th,
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember being like, "Okay mom." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So three days of expired chocolate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, mom I see you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I see what you're doing here.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but for some reason to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but for some reason to me,
advent calendar chocolate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just tasted better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't know why, like it's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have exactly the same opinions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I have no idea, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have no idea, why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause it's the same Cadbury's chocolate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it tastes 10 times better to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why. I may the only one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I used to agree, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I used to agree, because I
hadn't had an advent calendar, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was like, oh, fantastic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna be a kid again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I had one like three years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I had one like three years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I ate it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I ate it, and I'm like,
wow, this is just shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling)
This is shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I put them all out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I put them all out, on like December 5th. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I grabbed them all up, put it in my hand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you guys, have the one where like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Squish them together. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're kind of like, it like
cracks out like a medicine? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Both] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's cause you were a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Because, you know when
you're a kid, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Did they have these in
Australia, where they had? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So in the UK they have this
standard like $1, $2, eggs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is just an egg, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe you get a chocolate bars as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But when you were a kid,
you'd always see the big egg. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm talking like $30, $40
egg, that was like giant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like the magic is lost, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you know you could buy it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Because my parents were
never gonna buy me the $30. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They would never buy more than one egg. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So like, you don't need more than that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so when I was like, two years ago, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I bought the big egg. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it was reduced for like 10 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had I thing it was gonna be fucking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like God-tier experience, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> came with its own shitty mug, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and two chocolate balls. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just fucking shitty chocolate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just, it was awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, wow!
- I'm the opposite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I realized, when I
put all this chocolate down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like 300 grams of chocolate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I could have bought like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think 'cause the inside's hollow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I could have bought
like five times the amount </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of chocolate than when I paid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're fucking paying out the ass, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for them to put it in a fucking mold </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just fucking seal it together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause the thing is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm a fucking clown. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Logically my mind knows this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But every time it's Easter,
like even as an adult, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like now that I am an
adult, I just buy one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I eat it on the same day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is what something
I could never do before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the next day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm in my local Tesco's or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, I'll go for another Easter egg. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the thing is-
- Crack another one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the thing is I always
buy the Cadbury's ones, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that they always have
like the chocolates, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so it's always like Cadbury's
buttons or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I know I can taste, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's exactly the same chocolate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, it's
something about Easter eggs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like the right thickness, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> t's just something about
eating an Easter egg, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that just makes you feel like a king. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I actually prefer the ones,
that will like shaped out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a rabbit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, those are pretty good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Those are good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a good one lint one to Lenore, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> those ones like thick as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So something, maybe
it's not just Easter eggs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something about eating hollow chocolates, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that just hit different in my mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know about that one too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know what is
wrong in my psychology, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be like chocolate
bar, get that shit away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hollow chocolate, okay,
let me nibble on this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm curious, is there... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you have a worst </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or best Christmas present
you've ever received? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, God.
(sighing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The best one I received, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like the younger you were, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the better your Christmas present </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the time right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 100% dude, back when I could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just get a bunch of shitty toys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that lasted 10 minutes,
I was like, "What!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The probably best Christmas
gift I ever got was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I got, Gameboy Advance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh shit.
- When I was like five, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I played like the
shitty like Corby port. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was like the SNES game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which I found that ages
ago, was like $5 game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was just like, "This is
amazing father, thank you." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably the best present
I've ever got was an N64. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think it was more
the experience around it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because so I was at my
cousin's house and I opened it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> remember when game consoles,
were like the gods here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of anything you could ever get? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah!
- Like no gift to compare. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know your parents loved you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they got you a game console right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, "I feel truly loved, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thank you mother and father." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I remember my parents got me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was I don't know
when that came out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> do you know when the Wii
was like impossible to get. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like 2005 or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and it was impossible to get. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well they were like
all sold out in the UK, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when my dad worked in Germany
for like most of my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So when he came back for
Christmas, he brought me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, "Holy fuck,
how did you get a Wii?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then as we went to
plug it on Christmas day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Couldn't fucking plug it in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause he had the German plug. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then 'cause my dad obviously
just forgot to buy one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember booting
it up and it being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (foreign language)
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then there were like the
thing, like control, warning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like...
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I think warning your attention. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was warning, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like (foreign
language) or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "What is this
dad? Dad, help me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My dad couldn't fucking speak German, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so he was like, "I don't
know son, what are we doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I fucking had Wii sports but like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and some other games.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - V sports.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had some game and
the title was German. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember just I was like
so fucking confused as a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "What the fuck is this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I got the Wii for
Christmas as well actually, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> now that I think about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - She was bald man. (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you know what ended up happening, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was when Wii
sports was like insane? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The day we got it working,
which is next day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Wii sport, I couldn't fucking play, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause all my fucking older
relatives are playing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Wii bowling drunk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "When am I gonna
play Zelda? What the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> This is my gift, what the fuck?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing)
Go on Garnt.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I just remember my ... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One of my best memories of the N64, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which is the first time
my boost up GoldenEye, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with my cousins. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that was my first proper like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> multiplayer experience,
'cause it was like "Whoa, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> four people can play at the same time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we can play together." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And at that time, that
was fucking mind blowing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause the best full play game back then, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was probably like fucking Bama man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something like that.
- [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mario Party maybe? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No because Mario Party
wasn't out there yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It wasn't out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The first one was on N64. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I remember we
stayed up to like 4 a.m, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which back when I was a kid, was like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I might as well late,
not sleeping for two days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I might as well might
have been up for 40 hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whenever you get a brand
new game console man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> those endorphins are firing off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're like, oh my God dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't really get that anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause you can afford everything now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I guess so right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like doing a pine of cocaine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like seeing the PS5 I'm
like, I know if I get it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll play like Demon Souls and be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, I'm sure like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause The Jumper is
not significant anymore, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - PS4 games can load 20% faster now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, cool, epic man,
oh, wow, really excited. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like going from SNES to
an N64 it's like, whoa! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's insane.
- 3D </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You fucking kidding me, I
can walk in any direction? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What? Up is forward. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is this analog stick? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The cancer, that is the
fucking N64 control. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I look at that thing
now, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "How did anyone think
this was a good idea?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love picking it up stone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being like "God damn you
ugly son of a bitch." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I love you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel it again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I put my thumb on the
analog stick, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "How is it this fucking hot?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like this is designed to give blisters, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how did this pass the ergonomics test? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The moment I like put
my thumb on the joystick, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my palm just starts to hurt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like the memories </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of blistered palms doing
fucking this, my party too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You could get gloves from Nintendo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause they lost a lawsuit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because of Mario Party won.
'Cause of the palm injuries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, my palm, I got destroyed... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I couldn't believe that, it's insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just assumed the
design team at Nintendo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the first day on the job, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they just took like an ergonomics book </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just set it on fire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Its like, "Okay, we're designing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the N64 controller now guys." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Is it fun? Put it in?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Man I remember as well that same Christmas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when we got the Wii. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My older brother got, not the Death Star, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what's the other big
battleship in Star Wars? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The one that's like a fucking like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Destroyer or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't fucking remember.
- Something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then he built it all, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and for some reason had the amazing idea, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to put it near the TV, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in front of where we were with the Wii. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm sure you can
imagine what happened. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It fucking hit the roof. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Someone did the bowling
through it, slammed the roof, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> smashed down and destroyed this thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that he'd spent like eight
hours building, it was so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll never forget that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Watching my dad playing Wii Sports, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is probably the funniest thing
I've ever seen in my life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Broomers get so into it.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh dude, he was so into
fucking Wii boxing as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, of all the Wii sports ones, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was the fucking most intense one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm Mike Tyson, Joey watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And oh my God just watching
my dad's fucking doing this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> for like two hours, it's just so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember one Christmas,
I don't know how old I was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was in Sunday school, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I fucking hated Sunday school, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause why the fuck would
I wanna go, it was well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you are like eight, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't understand why I cared about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> why I should care about Jesus and shit? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> To me, I was like, "Who is
this guy? And why do I care?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who is this guy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whose man's? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who's the big J man, that
everyone keeps talking about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And so, I remember this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking hated it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My parents for some reason,
'cause my parents, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Not to out my parents here right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But they said they were, religious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My parents weren't fucking religious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They just wanted to be... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's literally like I feel
like the white suburban family. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, wait, yeah,
we believe in Jesus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we love J man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah we love him, we're all... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, my, whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like were not fucking religious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually asked my mom and dad, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when was the last time
when they went to church. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, how many decades? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - 1972.
(Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, so they put me...
they had the genius idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to put all of me and my
brothers, in Sunday school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And my older brother, he
never complains about stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He just gets on with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And me, you know me, I like to complain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, before we get into your story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is Sunday school? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, you don't know, okay true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a church school, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, I mean, it's
in America as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's more popular in
America, but in the UK as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's normally for like Christian stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or Catholic or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you learn in Sunday school? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I've never been to Sunday school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just know about Sunday school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I think I was too young, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to do the super religious stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So 90% of the time, they
just spoke about religious, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they would tell stories. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember being like,
"Who the fuck cares." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And also, I remember
coloring in so many pictures, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so many fucking pictures.
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you have a Jesus coloring book? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we had like a Jesus coloring page. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God.
- And I fucking hated it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was like, "Who is
this guy? Why do I care?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why am I coloring this guy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is the fifth time
we've colored in his birth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do we really need to
keep coloring this man? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I do remember being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and also one time, and it was, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd watch TV shows in American cartoons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they have like the paddling bowls. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have this very very vivid memory. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of one time one of the kids bringing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the paddling balls, and it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the coolest fucking thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they immediately
took it away from him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "No I wanna
play with the paddling ball." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why did they take away from him? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, 'cause it's Jesus time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No one interrupts Jesus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they made us do
like a play at Christmas, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I was like eight or nine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh well like the birth
of Jesus and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that my school did that as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it wasn't in school though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we had to do it in fucking Sunday school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What role did you get? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had to give meh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember being
like, "Mom, I don't..." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You were one of the wise men? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I was one of the wise men. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, man you got a big role. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was the snowman. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I think this 'cause, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was literally what I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I literally just did this on stage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you Jesus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then my mum still
has pictures being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt applauding) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Great performance, great performance." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (hands clapping)
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I was one of the wise men, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> only because I, there wasn't enough kids, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to fill the other roles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because there wasn't
enough kids in the school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hated it. I remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then also, I was like," Why
do I have to have meh, mom?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's got gold. I want gold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's bullshit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I didn't know how
to say meh at the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when I was a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why, it's just...
(both bleating) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Gold, I know gold mother. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Come on, give me ...
(Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember we had
to do this shitty play. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, I hate
this so much. I hate it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so for one Christmas,
I asked my mom I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> she was like, "What do
you want for Christmas?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meh.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dead ass looked her in
the eyes, and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't care about gifts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just please don't make
me go to Sunday school." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey chuckling)
I want my Sundays back mom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm going to school five days a week </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then another day I have to turn up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and fucking color pics of Jesus, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate this shit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think honestly, that's
the reason why I just care </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like zero religion now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because they pushed it so heavily on me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, this is shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's all a bunch of nonsense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're reading books,
stories about this dude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who I don't give a fuck about,
like there's no college. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you went to you went to
a Catholic school as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it wasn't a Catholic school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but they did make us
pray, three times a day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait so, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So in Wales, a lot of
schools should make you pray. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it's just like a
religious country in general. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even if it's an atheist school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's no atheist school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just, it's a school and
then a lot of them have like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just a school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
(both chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In my secondary school
and my primary school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think you pray three times a day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the thing is
right, that you realize, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe like in high
school, you're like, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they won't tell you
off, if you don't pray, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they can't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause it's a religious thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's still a school rule? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, no, it's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like a school suggestion?
- it's like a cult right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because when you get in this thing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You go to school and then
everyone suddenly bows their head </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and starts fucking speaking in tongues. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're like, "Oh, shit, I
should probably join in on this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna be the only one left out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then you realize after on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're not gonna do
anything if I don't pray </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just stand there and
look around and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What's going on?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You see all the other kids. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I would just refuse
to do it eventually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I'm like, I'm not praying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't believe in this nonsense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't understand why they made us do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Because we weren't a religious school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the thing, it's
like I find that a bit weird, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it would make sense if
you went to a Christian school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or a Catholic school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It might have been like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it wasn't officially a Christian school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but like a lot of the
schools in Wales were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Christian and school, something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think just a lot of schools
in England are like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> anyway, because, I don't
think I went to a Catholic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or religious school.
- No I do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We still did religious
things around Christmas time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I had no idea what
the fuck was going on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I come from a Buddhist family. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So we'd have events in the
church and stuff like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "This isn't a temple." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckling)
"What is this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - God, it's just like singing Welsh hymns, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know that the fucking
voice didn't get to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had to sing hymns as well.
I had no idea what they.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Me neither there was one, It was called </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (speaking foreign language) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it means cum on my head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so...
- J man please. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Behave yourself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know it's your birthday
and all but fucking hell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's literally called like
(speaking foreign language) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It literally translates to cum my head. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every time they would like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause there was a sheet of 12 hymns </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they would never do
(speaking foreign language) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because everyone would always like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> look at each other and giggle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and because the chorus was
just shouting, like loudly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ♪ Dod ar fy mhen ♪ </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They would never pick it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause everyone would just
start screaming, cum on my head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing)
In Welsh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause we're all fucking kids. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right.
- And we found it funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And every time they'd pick it,
it was like a fucking event, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because every old... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was the one time where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the kids who didn't really sing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and go
(mumbling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and would start, would proudly sing like.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - They'd be like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right boys in queue right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor chuckling)
(Joey clearing voice) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's weird because I went to... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my high school was a Catholic school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even though I'm not Catholic personally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but we didn't even have to
do the whole praying thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> We would have to do, maybe
like an end of term mass, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or like a beginning of term
mass and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Both] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like bring on the new year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah, we never had to do any... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did, it was one of those
things that when you left, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like, "That was weird, wasn't it?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "That was weird that they made us pray." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We were like pray before every
meal and stuff, and like.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a bit weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it is weird. What's
up with that Wales, man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And eventually my parents did grant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my Christmas wish and start... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh really?
- [Garnt] Oh really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Got you out of it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - At what age? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck, it was before I
started secondary school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it must have been.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How long were you in there for? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think like two or three
years. Fucking hated it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You make it sound like a prison. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> How long were you in there for? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How long were you in? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt exclaiming) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I literally... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you readjusted to society now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The amount of times I
was like, "Mom, I cannot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know you think this is
just me being a fucking kid, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I fucking hate this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Please, take me out of this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, as a kid,
like anything religious, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was just the most boring thing for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I remember whenever
my mom would take me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to temples and everything to go pray </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and talk to the monk and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just wanted to go home
and play N64 honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just like this,
what's fun to do here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> There is literally nothing fun to do here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in this religious place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is why like when you
see like those families, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> who like their kids, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just get like indoctrinated
into the (mumbling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Raised into the... I
think it's indoctrinated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Indoctrinated.
- I think so, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling)
they got... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Call out to anyone who's religious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're like the super
religious people, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I remember even was like eight, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I would hear these things like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "He turned wine into water." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember being like eight years old, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like did he though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Did he? I've never seen anyone do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Pretty... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm actually... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I'm gonna be like, that
sounds a bit bull shit to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just press X to tell.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do remember vividly being
like, I don't know about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Think so it didn't happen.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the same thing with Santa Claus, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like my parents would try
and tell me at like age 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that Santa was real. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "I'm not having any of that." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Come on.
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Reindeer's that can fly? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Come on mom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a question. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> At what age did you figure
out, that spoilers alert, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Santa isn't real. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, dude, I've like
went on an operation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> at midnight to like find out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling)
To prove... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You did like the stealth mission? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - To prove to them, that I
knew what they were doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I found out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I found out accidentally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because I think it was
maybe like 10 or 11. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was Christmas night
and I was like, fuck, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I really need to pee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I drank too much, whatever it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I got up in the middle of the night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My dad was like this, next to the tree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he just caught me red handed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> all right son it's time you found out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Both] (chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's time you knew the truth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You got me kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Both] (chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I know where, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I did like a thorough sweep of the house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you know, a few days before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll be presents here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> My theory is correct. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My hypothesis. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Couldn't find any presents in the house, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they must be hidden in the garage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, great, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll wait till midnight, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on Christmas until they bring them in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And as I slept, right,
it was like covert ops. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just pretending to sleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> My parents came in to
check if I was sleeping. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- And I wasn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I don't remember the
exact age I found out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Santa wasn't real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I remember as a kid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, the smartest
dumb kids in existence, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I would like be figuring out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> all these like logistics of how Santa, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could be able to send
these presents rounds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause there would be
years, where you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't be at home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'd be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "How's Santa gonna figure
out I a aint home?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You'd be that sober? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, we'd be sitting at
my cousin's house, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the presents would still be there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even though we were staying
at my cousin's house, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no matter where we were every year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And for some reason, it just
didn't click to me as a kid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that Santa wasn't real. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But, instead of just realizing
that Santa wasn't real, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was in my head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "So this is how
Santa knew I was staying here." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we went to our house,
didn't see I was there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Saw like, the notes that I left somewhere, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or saw, like the phone call,
that I had with my cousin, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that will come around to his house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's how Santa knew, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I was staying
around my cousin's house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I explained this to
my parents at the time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and my parents just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, you've figured it out." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got them
- "You've figured it out." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You've out-smarted Santa. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - God damn it, he's smart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're like the whiteboard
with like the pins on it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause like does he
operate like time zones? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like how does it look? Yeah fucking help. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I just remember being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Damn, none of this Jesus
stuff seemed to have happened." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I was like 10, I don't
know if this Santa stuff's real. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause none of this shit's happening, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm trying wine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you ever do like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's just like an American thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but did you ever do leave
like the the cookies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and the milk?
- Yeah, we did that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- We didn't do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't do that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that my dad just wanted food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw this brilliant, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Reddit post of like a dad, being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "So my son's left cookies and
milk on his bedside table. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But how do I tell him that
Santa is lactose intolerant?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Do I just drink the milk and
take the shits for my son?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Do I leave it there
and break his heart?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember one time my dad was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "No, no, no Connor, Santa likes beer." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm definitely doing that to my child. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so he legit poured beer for himself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then just drank it obviously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause he poured cold water for himself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was gonna be to my son, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Did you know that Santa
loves gin and tonic?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah Santa likes, an espresso Martini. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Leave the gin and tonic, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it maybe be as cheese platter on there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That will do, I mean Santa
will definitely eat that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The double of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Double shot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Santa, doesn't like
cookies, he like brownies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like the special brownies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the special brownies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Give Santa the special brownies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Santa loves G Fuel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just put a cup of G Fuel
next to the brownie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't believe that your
dad did not say that to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is so big brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause he just wanted a beer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is being brain as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause he knows that we believe it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I believed that it wasn't real, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I also was like, maybe, a little bit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a chance that someone's
drinking this, and yeah... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean Santa is a grown
adult, you know he might... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> He's working hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Possibly driving and drinking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckling)
but I mean, that's okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, question to you guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you normally have like a normal... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's your Christmas Day like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What's your typical Christmas Day like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you have any schedules? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you have any like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Used to have, you'd
open presents first thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is always the best part, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it always goes downhill from there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you remember the age where, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you just couldn't sleep before
Christmas, as a teenager, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just like, "Dude, I
don't care about this any more." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, because you
realize, when you were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, did you always
use to pick a lot of things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you would get some of them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or did you get everything that you picked? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would get some of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because my parents would also be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Listen, Connor, Santa's got a budget." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Really?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So then I had to look for the
products within the budget. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I never connected the dots, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, from age eight or whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I would go through like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> we had to think of like Argos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, Argos.
- What's that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they had like a giant,
fucking gigantic booklet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Imagine the most depressing
store you can think of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you go into the store, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's not a store, It's
just a store of catalogs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So imagine like Amazon warehouse, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but it will have a slight... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like an Amazon IRL. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you'd go in, you could book it online </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or back then you had to go to the store </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and take off the boxes you wanted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> According to the catalog. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Seems depressing is fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause the cats... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As a kid though, this shit was magical, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it had like everything in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you would go through
and now you realize </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this was just fucking overpriced. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - With all the shit lost, but
back then there was no Amazon, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so you're fitting it in the budget. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because how are
you going through it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause back back in the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you didn't really have the internet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you'd have to hold off this catalog. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you go into this at Argos store. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And there was this catalog, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was like as thick as a brick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You could fucking murder someone
with this catalog, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your phone book? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You'd go in and you
flip to like the index. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You'd go in and usually like (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Case closed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's right under act as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And so you flip through the index </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and go through like the game
sections and the toy sections, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> which was the only sections
you really looked at. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then it was just
like free picking space, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never had anything... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then basically, when I
turned off Christmas morning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there'll probably be a few surprises, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but most of the stuff that
I wanted would be there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Except that one time like I said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that kind of upset, fucking
dad bought me cricket tickets. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which he did a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I clearly expressed
my disdain for cricket </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I thought this is
gonna change his life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I genuinely like other
than the Gameboy Advance, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I genuinely don't remember
what else I got, from Santa. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - One Christmas I just got like all Yukio, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like I got the fucking jewel
arm thing and I got like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, you got one of those? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I got... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Aargh, jealous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - All my friends have got one as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jealous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We would turn up to
school and we play Yukio, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then they just stopped
playing after they realized, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my dad is spooky. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess Santa didn't have
the budget for that for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like I asked for one year, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I just didn't get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] I mean... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dad was like, "Fuck this
little shit, doesn't need that." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think he just got me like
a bunch of booster packs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He has the graveyard
and the fold out thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with the back of the
booster pack, he'll be fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, he'll be all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember for me, it
was always video games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never asked for
anything but video games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And that was because as a kid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there were only two times in the year, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I could get new video games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And one of them was my birthday, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and the other one was Christmas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is a fucking rare occasion, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if I managed to get a game
outside my birthday or Christmas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah exactly.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so I remember, it was
the highlights of my year, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'll be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Finally I can play something
other than Super Mario 64 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for like this like millionth time." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so, I couldn't get every game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I normally get like two, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if it was like a fucking special year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like, I knew my parents loved me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I got three video games man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, three games, is like
the limit for me as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like 100 quid, 120 pounds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're pushing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so I mean, that's probably why, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I always remember the N64. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause the N64 was just like God modes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I had never gotten a
bigger present in my life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at that moment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now that you say that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I remember why I wanted to... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Why I kept doing like chess
stuff and being good at things, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because my parents buy me shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If I wanted things,
they would buy me stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I said I should just win
the stuff that I'm good at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and they'll keep buying me things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause whenever I like win
a tournament or whatever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll go and buy me a game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, stonks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's just get good at something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that was me,
but just with school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and especially Japanese for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like if I did well in like my
Japanese tests and whatnot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My mom would be like,
"Yes, that is my son." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - My brother was always
better. So it didn't matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "I gotta find another niche." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, fair enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you have any family
traditions at Christmas? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We just have like family come over... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We have two parties, we have, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> one Christmas Eve so like 24th, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the night we would have kind of bring, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all that family friends over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So all my childhood friends and whatnot, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and friends from school
and whatnot, come to ours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then Christmas Day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the next day is when it's like family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like during the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For me it's the other way round. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Family day it's like completely sober, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like Christmas Day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Boxing day is when the
fucking party is at. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where we get drunk with the family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now Boxing days is recovery day for us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Boxing days is like, "We've
had two parties back to back, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we've gotta recover." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Stuff like family come over I think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and have a nice little get together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's nice for us as well,
because at my parents place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we have this... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's during the
summer in Australia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We have this big... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> We have like an out place, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with this like big backyard like deck, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that looks over everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so just crack open a cold beer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in like the fucking 30 degree summer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> on a Christmas is fucking awful, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I keep forgetting that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's weird to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or we go to my uncle's
place and we jump in his pool, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and we just do the pool
all day on a Christmas Day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was it was super weird for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like two three years ago, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was living in Thailand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we were celebrating
Christmas in Thailand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was just like, 30 degree heat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and us opening Christmas
presents under a Christmas tree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "This
isn't very Christmassy." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sweating man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This doesn't feel very Christmassy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to put the AC on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, okay. Have you
ever had a white Christmas? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've had it once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've had it once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So my family most of the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> preferred like go on like
vacation for Christmas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that just they
love going on vacation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the stuff they always
used to do is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "We're not gonna buy you stuff Connor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're gonna take you places." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which I appreciate now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But as a kid I fucking hated it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, "I don't wanna
go to fucking France, mom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking hate France. Everyone
in France is a dick head. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> can't you just get me the new Game board." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't see family on Christmas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it depends on, I
think every other year, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So so we would sometimes
go skiing or snowboarding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which sounds fucking epic now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your family have the right idea man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They are big brain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you know, when I was a kid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, 'I don't want
to fucking be away, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is my time off,
you're making me do work." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause to me right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> skiing and snowboarding with
my family was like a chore, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was a kid.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because they're so fucking slow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would have to like go on a ski thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I would just be like,
I would wait at the top. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Come on peasants. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would wait at the top
and I'm like, just go ahead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll be down. I'll follow you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I would wait for
five minutes on my phone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then when I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's been five minutes time
to go like full speed down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and catch up and like overtake them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I used to wait, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you know also when you're a kid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you don't have money,
I'm fucking hungry as shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and these results, 'cause like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we would go on like packages. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So they were pretty cheap. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Not that am trying to bash my parents, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm very grateful, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they were like the
cheapest possible way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that you could go to like Italy and ski. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which is fair enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean I applaud the effort, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but when you had to eat
out at these places, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they like charge a lot
for like food and drinks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - She was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "We're getting one meal between us all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're all gonna split it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, "Fuck mom I'm starving." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I would not, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> for more than one sixth
of the pizza right now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
(both chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Please, but going now as an adult, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I have my own money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I'll waste all
my money on the food there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't give a fuck, I wanna be full. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because like these activities, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I've realized the reason we
enjoy them so much as an adult. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you do with friends? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, not just that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But because we can get alcohol involved. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like going on
trips and everything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it just fun out with a pine and... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh it's 9 a.m it's time for flying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause what you do after
you have your fun activity, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you just want to wind down? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> As a kid you have fucking nothing to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But as an adult, you can just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get drunk with the boys and us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I enjoy spending
more time with my family </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> now that I'm an adult, than
I did when I was a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I've worked, I've
had three white Christmases </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and all three of them have been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I was working at
a ski resort in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's say having a white
Christmas in Australia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, no. That's a different
type of white Christmas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, like I had
the whitest Christmases </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in like ski resorts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's just
fucking white everywhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, the only difference
between the Christmas night, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at a ski resort and every other night, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that there's just more
white people outside really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the only difference, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because what do you do at a ski resort? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Other than skiing and snowboarding? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You get shit faced? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, that's the only... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sauna, is normally a good chance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Oh, like on sauna, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, other than that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like the only other thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you if you wake up in the morning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like, "Oh, man, my
body's feeling a bit sore, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna go skiing or snowboarding." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's nothing to do during the day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other than to go to the
one bar that's open 24/7 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and just gets shit faced. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And also because like,
fucking skiing and snowboarding, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is so fucking exhausting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Alright, that fucking
pine is like amazing." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You've ever been skiing or snowboarding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never been skiing or snow boarding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's always been... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, like, the reason
I've never been is just 'cause, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every holiday we went to Thailand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's also one of those
things where I feel like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why my family just were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> let's just go skiing for the first time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like normally you go
with someone, who's been. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So they can be like,"
I'll help you out." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Also like skiing lessons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Skiing lessons yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor And Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also, you know, when I was growing up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wasn't in the most privileged position, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where my family could kind of afford that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I feel like going skiing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is like an expensive holiday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or can be, expensive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it is. I mean... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Especially if you're in
a country that doesn't have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like resorts nearby. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly.
- Exactly right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what I realized this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when I started flying for like
conventions and stuff, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was I always thought, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the airports were even worse
than they actually are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because right, if you get
one of those package deals, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the company that does the
package deal, charters the plane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you all have to like wait
in this fucking horrible line </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these planes are like the fucking worst. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And the people are the worst as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the worst
kind of British tourists. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, which I'm sure
you've all seen videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of you watch like Apple meltdowns. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's always British people, always. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude these these fucking
flights are awful, it's the most, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, God.
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You've been on them? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've been on okay, so
the most depressing place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been to on earth I
think, is Luton Airport. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, it's awful.
(Connor clearing voice) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or in UK?
- In the UK? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, so we stayed, so
you know, back before... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back when I was just like
fucking poor and all that stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We booked this holiday. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was me and Sydney at the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we booked this holiday
on this like budget airline, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that flew out of Luton, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I remember to save costs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when needed to stay near Luton, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it was actually
cheaper to stay near Luton, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than to like get there in the morning, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the like rush hour. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so we picked the cheapest hotel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which happened to be Easy hotel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh, no! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which I didn't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That already sounds (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, so in Europe, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's this there's this
budget airline called EasyJet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the worst. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's the worst, one
of the worst airlines. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wouldn't say it's the worst, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's worse Ryanair? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd say Ryanair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Ryanair is fucking (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There just both two
sides of the same coin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Anything that flies out Luton, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is automatically like horrible for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, so we stay in Easy hotel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I've never felt like I've paid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to stay in a prison cell before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Until I stayed there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it was like we go in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's literally like no windows. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just a white
room right, with a bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's just a black room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like the walls are paper
thin and they were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I could hear at least like
three different people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking in different rooms. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I go into the shower, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a shared shower right or is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, you had your own private shower, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor exclaiming) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's one step up isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like there wasn't even like a door </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like separate the
shower from the bed, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So so it was just like curtains, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you open up these curtains </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there is like a toilet seat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there is a
shower right next to it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it just it was the like definition </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of how I imagined a
prison shower to be right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause the only thing said that... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause there's nothing
separating the toilet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the shower. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you just showering and so
what while you're showering, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the toilets just like
getting fucking soaked, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's got like the gray
kind of like floor as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So if you felt like I
was in a prison cell, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I had to pay good money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How much was it for like, a night? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember, like 20 quid a night. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, fuck hell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would have rather
stayed in prison cell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just like me and Sydney there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but I was like, I better
not drop the soap man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I better not drop
the soap while am here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Something will just burst
through the fucking walls like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (growling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its just like Ryanair and EasyJet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you forget your ticket, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they charge you like 50 euros or... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got charged that when we flew from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking Amsterdam to Ireland. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got charged that as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you?
- Yeah I did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never wanted to smack
an attendant in my life right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but when she said that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like my hand is
my backhand is ready. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah and like if you have
over like five kilograms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or something, which is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what you're obviously going to have over. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - They charge you like 50
pounds to bring a carry on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So dumb. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's awful (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's right in this fine print, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where they tell you you
can't check in, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I think that's the big one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I understand, not having, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not be able to check in or everything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like putting it in
like the fine print. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's just a dick move. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it is like, what is it like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like Argso designs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That is it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they have like a million
ads, before you even get to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you wanna like get to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the amount of fucking rental cars, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they fucking try and show you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is up the ass online.
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And also even if the
plane is completely empty, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they won't let you choose seats </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they on purpose scatter you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that they force you to pay
to sit next to each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I'm like fuck that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, we're not doing
that, I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll see him when I land. Who fuck cares. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah it's like that.
- I'm not that desperate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I need to be within a
two meter radius of my friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> all the time, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We have something similar in Australia, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's called Jetstar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every every fucking
like continent has that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey exclaiming) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's so bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I fucking flew Jetstar once
from Sydney to Brisbane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was like an hour and a half flight, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's the worst fucking
flight I've ever been on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like delayed three hours for no reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you get there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it's like 60 million years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the luggage to come
out on the other side. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, where's is this luggage? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - God it's like, you've been on Norwegian? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You've been on Norwegian right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've been on them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You'll fucking hate Norwegian airlines. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Norwegian's okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not, oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like compared to other budget airlines, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Norwegian is like the Rolls
Royce of budget airlines man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's 'cause it's
the only budget airline, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like long haul I swear, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you can do you can
have a 12 hour flight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they will give you no food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - On Norwegian?
- You have to pay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah but like any any budget
airline that has movies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That has a movie choice is already, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like better than 90% of... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it only has movies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because they don't make those planes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the ones that do long haul,
without them built in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think they do that anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think it's possible, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure if they could
have removed the TVs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and made you pay for them, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure they would have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like the fact that
they can go 12 hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and not give you food, like blows my mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never been on
Norwegian airline that long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd say I've been on worse, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And and also it's a 12 hour flight right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they try and they charge
you for like a carry on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where the fuck were you flying to? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - LA to UK.
- UK to LA, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And always Norwegian.
- Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because they were by far the cheapest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You guys didn't have
like American or United </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or anything? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then-
- So- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But they were more
like double the price. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Broke as fuck, so it
was like either Norwegian, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> which was pretty consistently
always like 400 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Return.
- Jesus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - From London to LA
and then the next stop, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like United which was like 500 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but back then is like 100 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, that's a big deal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like that's a slightly better hotel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it wasn't 400 to 500, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like 400 to 600. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 600 to 700.
- Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think you got what you paid for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that Norwegian
is good for the price. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And if you're like someone broke, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who's trying to go to
like AX or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or trying to go to LA for
for the... (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it was just like every single time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just run the risk of
you know dying of starvation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every single time I was on the plane, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was fucking hungry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just eat a shit ton before you get on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Bring a ton of snacks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and you'll be good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just have to fast on air. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The first time I didn't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't know that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I saw that you
could pay for a meal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, they'll give you like
a snack or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Nothing. You don't get anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You get nothing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Would you like this granola bar for $6. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like these chairs,
I don't know how they, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like they've engineered these chairs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be fucking god awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, at least other airlines,
have semi competent chairs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but for some reason on Norwegian airlines, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they fucking handcrafted this shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be disgusting and painful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And if you get in the
middle row of the four, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like just give up
on being happy in life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the next 12 hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And one time I went on it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there's, I was on the end,
the aisle seat, of the three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, well, it's not
the middle of the four. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I'm happy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And this couple were like
making out next to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I swear they were fingering each other. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I was like, this is disgusting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna die, please, please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And no amount of like,
don't look at the side, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could like focus me on
Game of Thrones Season Four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or the fuck I was watching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, please, please, please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because it's
like this the one time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you curse that you have
a periphery, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because the one every time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would take my headphones
off for a second, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I could hear like (mimicking) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God.
- Oh God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tell you what, if you're
gonna go on a budget airline, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just pay 300 bucks for a good pair </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of noise canceling headphones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Honestly, like, that's the
best advice I can give you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't cheap out on them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know what it is about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the airplane design of
seats, that are just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ergonomically designed to be
the most uncomfortable thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've ever sat on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you see those standing
seats they were trying to make. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- What </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like to fit more people in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're trying to make
standing seats for airlines. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that like they can fit more people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> its just basically like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - At this point, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's the difference between
that and just being cattle? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean?
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, we're just we
literally being herded in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Obviously it was the budget
airlines trying to do this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like fucking sardines. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- 'Cause they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we can fit 20% more
passengers in the economy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if we do this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But no one wants that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- No passenger wants that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause their argument, was
that if it's a two hour flight, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can stand for two hours? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, I don't want to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, it's terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fucking awful.
- What's that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't mind a one hour
flight, I'm like, whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But like when it's 12 hours,
sometimes I like bad seat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even a prison transport
system has seats guys, come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - They do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even a prison bus you
can sit down, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's sad man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the point was, is
that now that I'm older, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm grateful that my
parents took me on vacation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But when I was a kid I fucking hated it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also now I'm older, I'm
glad I have disposable income. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Back to the thinking about
to the broke uni student days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Going back to Christmas? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you ever have like
any Christmas movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like stuff that you'd watch? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I never got the concept
of Christmas movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or like holiday movies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, like my dad is
like such a fucking film snob. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hated it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But the moment he hears
the word Christmas movies, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like, poof. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Get a shit away from me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had relationships where
they would wanna watch, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking around that time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they would just be obsessed with watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the same fucking movies and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I don't wanna watch for the 50th time." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm currently in that
relationship right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, fucking man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Disney movies are fine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but can we know not
watch just Disney movies? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Can we just watch something else? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I'd rather that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than the shitty live
action Christmas movies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like it's always, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they always have like
the same kind of titles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's always the same theme of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, it's a romantic comedy kind of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's also wholesome." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And by the way, the entire
soundtrack to the movie, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is Christmas carols. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Have fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every relationship I've been in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like, "Yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love this Christmas
movie and they put it on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's fucking Elf, it's always Elf." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's always Elf. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's always fucking elf. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Elf is like the Christmas class. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was trying to... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its like The Office
for like white people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but on Christmas (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was trying to
convince Aki that Die Hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is a Christmas movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is, a Christmas movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She did not believe me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> She was like, "Die Hard
the fucking yappy KI1 " </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yes the Ep KI1 that is a Christmas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There are two things that I know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I will probably not
get on with the person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that if that if they say like
if they love Disney movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> more than like a healthy amount, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or if they want a horse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Those are the two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The two ways I know I'm probably
not gonna get on with them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some slides. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is it? What is
it about horse speeding? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everyone his haul skills are crazy man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because they they're
gonna love the horse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Especially being a relationship with one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're gonna love the horse
more than they ever love you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, and that's just like,
that's a fact. That is 100% </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Horse skills are just the
equivalent of car dudes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's dudes with a Honda
Civics in the profile picture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No offense, Alexi, but... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never, at least with
us like we never got like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> especially with like
Halloween movies as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like Halloween
movies, Christmas movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are there even Easter
movies? Is that a thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They try to make that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that a genre? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That shouldn't be a
genre of Easter movies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] Passion of the Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [All] The passion of Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Passion of the crisis at least a movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Good old fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - One time my best mate, his
dad for his like 14th birthday </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got in fucking Bruno on DVD. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> He had no idea what it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But his joke was like,
I think you're gay son. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So his Bruno. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No joke. I remember I went to his house, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck happens in this family? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> We watched fucking Bruno
like 15 at his house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I mean so confused
with some other things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's just like the
equivalent just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here you go."Why are you gay?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why are you gay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You are gay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Here's Bruno, he was that
one kid where his parents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just didn't seem to give a fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, yeah, sure you can watch porn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where are you two heading? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, whatever.
We'll get to it eventually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, just just get a
head start, you'll be good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So fucking weird, so weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I don't understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching some of the Christmas movies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But I do like the feeling
of just getting together </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and watching a movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, it doesn't necessarily
have to be a Christmas right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I understand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like watching like family movies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> especially on Christmas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - My parents just have
shit tastes and movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? Wait, what's the
definition of a family movie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like a rom com? Or? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I showed my
parents like Wolf children </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with the family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was like a very nice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was it was nice family bonding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can not get my parents
to watch anything animated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There like," Cartoons, no, no, no." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, no this was something I had to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> slowly slip in the idea for years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is like this was like inception. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, for years, I would be like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Plant like seed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah you don't just like rock up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Christmas and be like,
"Mom, Dad, I want to show you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> some animated titties." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, you gotta like plant
the seed to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yo, there's this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, I could not get my parents to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no matter what I do, they would refuse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, my dad was like
fucking strict about his movies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause again, he's a fucking film snob. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So he's like, "The only
anime movies that I will like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and enjoy is Akira and Wicked City." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "If it doesn't have
animated, I ain't interested. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey chuckle) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think to people in the UK, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially around my parents age, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to them anything animated
equals for children. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right? We should show them Wicked city. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (chuckles)
- I'm sure if I did... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - My dad like Ninja Scroll as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh damn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your dad has taste, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But those are the only three movies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, "Is it violent,
does have titties in it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt chuckles)
I'll watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hell ya.
- So there's no way... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Already a Christmas
movie, though, is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I don't expect my dad to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, son, Merry Christmas.
Let's watch Wicked City." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I never got the
idea of holiday movies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just never really saw the point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because, again, for us,
like Christmas was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a time to like celebrate with like family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, like do believe in the so called </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like Christmas spirits
and everything like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you think I'm? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you think... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well I don't know, because
like, It's different now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But the only the only
thing that's different now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really is being a YouTuber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause like my like my entire life, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up until I became a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Christmas was this like special holiday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it was a holiday. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, especially if you're in
like an office job as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was the biggest holiday of the year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so I don't know it was just like it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like I got programmed into thinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that this was like a
just a special holiday. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And even if I wasn't my family, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, something like
watching Christmas anime for me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like watching like some of
my favorite Christmas anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like The Disappearance of Haruhi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He was just like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's something I could never
get bored of watching them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, me too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a Christmas Day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I know you love (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I don't give a shit
about most Christmas movies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But give me that Christmas anime man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I never I never chopped
up. I never thought. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I suppose it's weird for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Because you grew up in a country
where sunny and Christmas, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every Christmas movie... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's no there's no concept of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> grabbing a blanket and
cuddling up on the couch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to watch a Christmas movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because you'd be sweating. (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Always fucking cold in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's like, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - For us, It's like, "Oh, Merry Christmas, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> let's turn it on the cricket." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that was in for us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I think that as I get older, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I appreciate the idea of it more, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is just spending time with families. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My little brother lives with my parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and my older brother
doesn't live too far away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's not often to go visit him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But for me it's, 'cause
I haven't seen them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in over like a year I guess,
when I moved to Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And originally they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You want to come back
for Christmas Kotah? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the first Christmas
was like three months </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> after I moved here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Like No, I just got here." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not coming back, fuck that,
I'll come next Christmas." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm gonna celebrate
Christmas with the boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll come next Christmas
site, that never happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, my family and like
over a year and a half now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that weird, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm sure you would have seen them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I would have normally,
yeah, definitely seen them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We would not be here right
now if the regular Corona. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Probably if it would be back but that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how it is unfortunately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I guess as I get older, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's made me appreciate that
what it is it's an excuse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to go see my family then come off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. Like I remember. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like when as as a kid
and as a young adult, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Who gives a shit about tradition." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm too cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who really gives about- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck the system. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who really gives about tradition and all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this stuff but like growing
older, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "There is something a bit special </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about keeping family traditions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and doing something special and like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's, the whole Christmas bear thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like cheesy and shit like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I will say like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing something special that
you do every year on Christmas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that reminds you of how you were as a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and stuff that your parents
parents like bestowed upon you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and everything is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's something special about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You appreciate, I appreciate them all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like those like I really liked as a kid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't get as a teenager
and a young adult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, more I've grown
older the more I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, that's a special thing." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I also wanna just
keep in touch with my parents, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously and just see
them as much as I can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I just thought about I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fuck, my little kid's
gonna be a little shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if its raised by me." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, he's gonna
fucking, he's gonna fuck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> off the moment he can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I better instill some values
in him to come back and say hi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I'm an old fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Fuck my dad, you did the same thing." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I mean like, as a kid, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the highlight of Christmas was
the fucking presence, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> As you grow older presence
become like a non factor now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Is when you can just, when
you have a disposable income, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, alright, give me the
presence. Give me a drink. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because my
parents now, they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "What do I get you Connor?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because you know, you
buy everything you want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "Well,
I don't know actually, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. Think of something." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Yeah, money can I ask money?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So now our presence are
just like a non factor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you you gotta have
something to look forward </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to for the Christmas holidays, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Spending time with the family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Spending time with the family. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Spending time with
the family, or the boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, to explain what we
did last year in Christmas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We just stayed up to like 3
a.m watching Super Monkey Ball, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> speed runs and it was fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was good.
- Amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't belittle it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can we start tradition. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Obviously I could start that
fucking tradition, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't know the magic of
Super Monkey Ball speed runs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> until you watch one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude that like, especially
when you're drunk as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like insane. Like it just defies gravity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, just enjoyment,
but it's really entertaining. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was super entertaining. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But we also watch Die
Hard right before that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We did watch, or we did
we actually did watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh we did watch a Christmas movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because that was
when I was still naive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and thinking like Die Hard
isn't a Christmas movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you guys will
like, "No, no trust us." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can still eating the hotpot, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> While I play it, that's right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then we're like, let's
watch a Christmas movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Die Hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then we want something
like, "Well, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's I stand corrected.
This is a Christmas movie." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is Christmas movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know before fucking Bruce Willis </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just gave up on acting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You've seen his recent films. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, fucking how that awful.
- Really. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He refuses to like do anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's a double doing everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You should watch some of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you watch, what
is it called Hard kill? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Watch that movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hard kill? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hard Kill, watch that movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sounds like a fucking Die Hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fucking watched it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's oh my fucking god. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I watched
Looper, and I was like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just realized the
absurdity of that name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He does... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey and Garnt] Hard Kill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He does like he just
like six movies a year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and there all like straight to DVD. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like a Kadima
character, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Seriously, watch these dudes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its like a metal geek (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - In some of these scenes
he's given so little fuck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about trying, that like it's
just a dubbed over actor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's so lazy dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's take two edgy words
and smash them together. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like hot death knife, hot kill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Please okay, this Christmas,
we're watching Hard Kill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you could see how fucking
awful Bruce Willis is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I gonna say I gotta say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's fucking terrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I think the last Bruce Willis film </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I watched was Looper. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And even then it was like,
your not even trying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You've given up, you don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This guy's made his cash
already, like he's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have made so much
money just fucking stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That one Joseph Gordon
Levitt is like acting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Bruce Willis which is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You can you can carry this one." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - (crosstalk) And it's
just like Bruce Willis. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He stands up to the set </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and apparently like all the things he does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is like he agrees to do like
three days of shooting right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's it like no more, no retakes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And hot, anything that
physically doesn't require him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is a body double. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So even if it's like getting on his knees. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like don't you get a body (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Because he's too lazy to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I did watch a, I don't know
when it was pretty recent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But why it did like a Bruce Willis </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> answers like most googled questions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He doesn't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was one of the most boring
wide videos I'd ever seen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because he just he was
monotone the entire time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - At least like Harrison
Ford, when you can tell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that he respects the
movie and the director </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tries like in Blade Runner, the new one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He was fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But when he's in interviews, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> he's like, "I don't fucking give a shit." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Bruce Willis is always like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like nothing makes Bruce Willis care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like he literally is like
the angriest oldest con, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in all of these interviews
like, you can tell he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah whatever, I've made my money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just set up I just tuned up
and said words, it's acting." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like all right Bruce Willis fucking out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - God could you imagine if
YouTubers get to that point? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I didn't know
I didn't want to say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but some of us are already there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Not us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, some YouTubers already there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - God, I just couldn't
imagine just still doing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when I hate this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like especially if you've already </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> made your fucking fortunate and name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - At that point, you just
doing it stay relevant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but like the thing
is like you don't have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to stay relevant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> If you don't Like at the
point of like Bruce Willis, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like everyone knows your fucking name </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and what you look like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why like, no
one watches action movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and like that has like a big name to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why they get
him, because they can... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He just makes it a lot of bank, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> his name has a lot of
poll for action movies, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean are action movies
even like a big thing nowadays? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause John wick is... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was gonna say like,
aside from john wick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's the thing right
if you can bring it back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you can do it well,
with the right actors, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it'll be huge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like you're talking about
like, ones that aren't falling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> under like a notable IP. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But John Wick why
can't kill (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like John Wick, wasn't a notable IP, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until (indistinct) notable IP. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But when did John
Wick one... (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hard Kill to me sounds
like one of those titles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where like say when I when
I was in Thailand, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That I would I would always have this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would always go to like
in like Southeast Asia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's always these stores
that you can buy like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pirated pirated DVD. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you'd go through like
you flick through the covers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and you'd see these like
the most random movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of these like A-list actors,
but you'd never heard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the film before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah
- That's Hard Kill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is also all of Bruce
Willis' recent filmography. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Its old movies like, how is this man doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> eight movies a year? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How does that happen? How
do you have time for that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I kind of want to just
like go through his IMDb, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just to see the title. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's like, that I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the reason why and
like, imagine at the time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> people would probably didn't give a fuck </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about action movies until
like Terminator came out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And probably at that time, you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is this is crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck like, because I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's not James Cameron
directing it, which... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like 80's was like a
fucking golden period </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for action movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it was like the Schwarzenegger, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who's the other one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Stallone.
- Stallone, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Claude Van Damme. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean I could, really
easily re watch, like so many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of their action movies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that's also when like martial arts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when results I was drawn
to like, kind of... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause I feel
like before John Wick, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was this huge
period, where action movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were just not putting
in the numbers any more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm so reading these fucking titles, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never had any of
these fucking movies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because they're
all straight to DVD. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So we have 2017, First kill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Acts of Violence, Death Wish, Airstrike, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 10 Minutes Gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Trauma center, Survive The Night. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know any of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> By the way, all of
those are direct to DVD. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. All of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sounds like a satire of
themselves at that point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one wants to hire
him, because why would you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> he's just gonna turn
up and fucking be lazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And this five movies right
now that has been announced </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with Humana that is like to be announced. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Midnight in the Switch Grass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well we got...
- Cosmic Scene. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, we're watching
one of these on Christmas man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I got it because they fucking
awesome, we're gonna watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> He's given up dude. It's terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God that's really bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Stop making films, like why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Its really sad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We'll watch one of these on Christmas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and tell you how it is next time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why?
- Oh, my God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you boys have any
plans this Christmas, like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm curious to see what
this Christmas will be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in the current world situation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's probably gonna be the
most depressing Christmas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of all time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because Christmas in Japan
is like it's a bit weird, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you wanna explain what
Christmas in Japan is like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so essentially... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Be it by KFC </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Christmas in Japan is
sponsored by KFC, basically, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like KFC, is the go to place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did that start? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Japan, okay, it's because I did a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on this a few years ago,
but basically the theory </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is that Colonel Sanders
right, looks like Santa. </SPEAKER_01>

That's the theory. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because think about it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Think about it. Christmas colors. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What are the Christmas colors red? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> What does Colonel Sanders
dressed up in red, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Doesn't he, white it is I thought. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the KFC color has red
on it and then Colonel Sanders </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is an old guy with a white beard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Kind of looks like Santa right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I bet if you trace that back, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like the most five head KFC employee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like working in the marketing team. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah that's basically it,
it was a marketing ploy by KFC </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to be (crosstalk) basically
they were like well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the Christmas dinner
overseas and in the West </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they have chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They have roast chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Fried chicken is kind
of the same thing right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like still chicken. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Why don't we try this,
Let's try one (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're gonna try and sell this,
and it just fucking exploded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because you can't get a
roast chicken in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> other than KFC. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Outside of some convenience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I saw this there'll be an employee dressed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in a Santa outfit, with a
fried chicken. (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - They sell like cakes, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is fucking weird,
what am I looking at? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's bizarre. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm looking at an Asian man
dressed in a Santa costume, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> selling me fried chicken
in the name of Christmas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's also weird as well because, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like normally like everywhere
else in the West, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Christmas is like a family thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You gather like mom, dad, grandparents. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Here in Japan it's like a beta balance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a you go on dates. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, you all should go to the prom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's that's Christmas eve. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that part I understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because literally a week later
its New Year's Eve right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And New Year's Eve is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a super Buddhist family thing in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- So it makes sense... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The opposite of what it
is in Western cultures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In Wester culture like
its like oh, New Year's Eve. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> See next year parents. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. So I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just, I personally have
I mean, well, this year, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I plan to go up north to go see Chris. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we're gonna we're gonna go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to Nazi Spies and have KFC for Christmas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For Christmas.
(Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's the plan. That's the plan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, man, first time ever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been lucky five years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> First Year, I'm gonna have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the true Japanese Christmas experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of eating KFC. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll let you boys know how
depressing it actually is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it's not like I
remember before coming to Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd heard so many rumors
about Japanese KFC </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being the best KFC in the world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You ain't tried KFC until
you had Japanese KFC </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I came here and then I hate it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it was just KFC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The UK one was better even. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought the UK we have a better menu. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is the most meat KFC I've ever had. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I love the burgers,
the chicken sandwiches </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that you get in KFC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, they're fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - In the UK, they're so good as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, I don't know
what it is about UK, KFC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is good.
- I mean... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel though you guys
have kind of perfected </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like fast food chicken with Nando's right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, that's like
South African though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But we just I think every
single fast food chain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the UK has like fried chicken options </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> as a not on its own. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like McDonald's I think
some of those popular </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff they sell in the UK is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just like a chicken selects </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and also like the wrapped chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, that's fucking amazing,
that's the best thing I get. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And every like dirty kebab </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> still has like the fried
chicken option as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So this is fried chicken everywhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because British is the best KFC, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan is like somewhere in the middle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then America is like(crosstalk) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do I want to feel like shit? KFC it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't know
why, like American KFC </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just stopped trying 'cause
there's not like America </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't have bad fried chicken options. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just one of the like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of the biggest chains
are just the worst in America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I don't understand why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember I was drunk one time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> someone gave me a KFC chicken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In America?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even drunk me was like this is violent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's bad if I'm drunk me is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> this is too much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I draw the line at the amount of grease </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is on this thing.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like the skin wasn't crispy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was moist from all the grease it had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's vile sorry we somehow turn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this all around a bashing America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey chuckle) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love America I do, I
just what's going on now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - America can't do chicken correctly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Case in point Chick-fil-A? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Chick-fil-A. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like that's why I
don't understand why anyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in America would eat KFC
when there's stuff like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chick-fil-A or Popeye. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I never see good reviews on
Google Maps or for like KFC. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's always like two stars, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who's willingly going in here? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Stop giving them fucking
customers, just stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because its Sunday, right
and chick-fil-A is closed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's true, I mean, not not all parts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of America have Chick-fil-A apparently. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, no, they don't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - East Coast doesn't have
Chick-fil- A or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's like different chains, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> different areas as well, I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But what I know is KFC is the worst </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> fried chicken I've ever had in America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, honestly, now I
feel like Christmas for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is more of like, it's
Christmas when I spend it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the people, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So it doesn't have to be on Christmas Day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Around the time give or take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as I hang out with some friends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It could be like a week before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get a few drinks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just be like let's just
do an early Christmas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Strange a few gifts,
you know , its Christmas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do want to do something on Christmas, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because this... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I find like Christmases
where I've done nothing before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it is a bit depressing when
you're just like by yourself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or they do nothing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You go on your timeline,
you get into twitter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's opening presents
with each other just like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But what if you haven't
like Christmas Day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the next day with your friends? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like alright,
whatever, I'm getting it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's what's worse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is New Year's alone for some reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've had New Year's alone before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, say I have to, and for some reason, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's more depressing than Christmas alone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I spent New Year's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one year in the worst
fucking way possible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I was like 16 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was working up at a
ski field the first time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was working up at a ski field. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we're in the middle of
Hokkaido in the mountains. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like fucking minus 30
degrees in a fucking Blizzard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And of course, I'm working that day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm outside in the fucking
Blizzard shoveling snow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But on top of that, one of the hotels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had a blocked sewage system. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I had to get in there
with a fucking shovel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So imagine a 16 year old right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In the middle of a fucking blizzard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the mountains. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Literally shoveling
shit out of the ground. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like, "Happy New Year" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like 11 p.m, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And literally the moment
we've uncovered the thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> my boss was like, "Oh it's the next year." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
"Happy New Year." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you unclog it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, yeah, we did.
- Nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But also it was like, cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My first experience of
the New Year is the smell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of frozen shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's only up from there, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, well, sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a good year, but it wasn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It wasn't the greatest start of the year, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's for sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like New Year's
like the biggest hoax </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that everyone's put over the case. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's never as good as you want it to be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's hyped up as the
biggest party of the year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And nobody knows what they're doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until the day before I swear
to fucking (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everything's full. Like
you can't get in anywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everywhere is overpriced. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everywhere is full,
everyone's doing something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aside from you, for some reason, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> even though you ask a week before, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey, what are you doing with New Year's." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and they don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And yes somehow on New
Year's you're that one fucker </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who just has nothing nothing planned. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's always the last
one like the last day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of the year, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you have the biggest FOMO of the year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you like (breathes heavily) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is always somehow always more often </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> than not doing nothing
like always being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fuck I missed out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, you might as well rename
New Year's Eve FOMO party, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because that's what it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what New Year's Eve is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone goes out because
they're afraid of missing out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I've spent New Year's alone before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it is depressing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its really depressing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, it's it's really fucking depressing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shout out to the people out
there who's gonna be alone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like, at the same time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of my worst fucking nights have been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on New Year's Eve as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its never a good night. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's always just so stressful
because you can never get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a taxi either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- If you need to get back, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause everyone's getting
taxis (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It only took me one New Year's Eve </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of going out to know that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All right, next New Year's Eve from now on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just house parties. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The only people who
win Uber drivers, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're the only ones
winning the New Year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - True. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck, man. I got, New
Years is for the worst. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey chuckle) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck, I just realized how
much I hate New Year's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I gotta do something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want to be sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like yo, either sad or
you're having a shit night, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or you're broke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's no perfect New Year's Eve. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's no perfect New Year's Eve. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - My God, I fucking hate New Year's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you guys have any
plans for this New Year? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Both] No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll figure that out
when it comes to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you'll figure that out before... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We just said we don't, we
nobody knows what they're doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until like the day fucking before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because everyone's
they always do this thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for New Year's right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Where everyone's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "We could go here," like
everyone is always like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's throw suggestions
on New Year's but no one wants </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to commit to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Because you don't want to be the asshole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who took them to a place that's full. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then it's like, "Well, then what?." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like we're in the... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because no one wants to
commit 'cause everyone knows, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, this place is gonna
be overpriced and full" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's leave this until
like the last moment, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the thing is,
there is no good place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for New Year's Eve. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But you have to go to a place, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like your your maybe
your friend can get you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> into somewhere and then you can only get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like half your friends in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then it's like, well,
what the fuck is happening? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Do we just leave half off friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and tell them to go fuck themselves? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but I'm like the best
New Year's Eve party would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably be a house party. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like no one wants to host
a New Year's Eve house party. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sure, it's always like a voting ballot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you just don't want that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And even then it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Do I really like everyone in this party?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like see other people? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because like as like a teenager, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're hosting a New
Year's Eve house party, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that house is getting trashed? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You knew it was getting trashed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And no matter how small
you wanted it to be? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was never going to be small. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it's a New Year's Eve party. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but yeah, because
you don't want it to be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's somehow like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reverse like depressing when
it's like, three people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Too small and it's depressing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like I'd like I swear like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> as a teenager you'd have like
fucking sniffer dogs trying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to sniff out house
bodies man you just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Where can we go boys? Where can we go?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "I've heard in the grapevine that there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is a house party somewhere around here." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That one mate who knows
someone who'd known someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who's less who'd heard about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a house party happening (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not proud of it definitely
spent a New Year's just going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to house parties that like we just full </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then not being able
to get into any of them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then I was like, "Guess
we're just going to Tesco </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and getting a few beers
and just sitting outside." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've had some of the most
like depressing New Year's Eve </SPEAKER_03>
