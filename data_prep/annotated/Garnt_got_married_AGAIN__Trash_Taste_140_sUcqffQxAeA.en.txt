<SPEAKER_00> YouTube yes I I've I've given up on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> making money on YouTube via ad Revenue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> holy [ __ ] like my all like my last for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the last six months I think I have had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> only one video that has not been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> demonetized are you serious yeah on my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> main Channel at least which is what if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're wondering why I never upload </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anymore unless I have a sponsor on it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why otherwise I would not make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> any money on it but you know sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you gotta take the L's with the L's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes is it because do you think of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the anime content or do you think it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because like something else like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's wearing it's always something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> different there's like a million </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um sometimes it's some of the anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> content sometimes it's the language </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes it's the music but as long as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have sponsorships I'm also very like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unwilling to compromise on the way I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to make content yeah that's you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know as long as I have sponsors I'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> keep making videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't know it was still that bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because like I definitely got the brunt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of that like you know when the first ad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Pockets thing happened but like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been pretty good for the past year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or so I mean you never really got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> affected that much right I know yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I was it was really weird because I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know when the whole apocalypse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> happened everyone was like freaking out </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> think three days was the perfect amount </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah really I wanted to be there a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> little bit longer I mean I because we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we only really got to explore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like kind of like I feel what is kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a corner of Bangkok yeah with the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> super touristy stuff we did yeah which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is fine because it's like that's how you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> get introduced to it of course it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through the touristy stuff yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know taking more than three days </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> off of work oh my God </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah bro you literally cycle for eight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> days what are you talking about yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know but that was work though </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what your excuses yeah no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um yeah I feel like no I I kind of agree </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like we did kind of go to all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> touristy places but I think that just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> made me want to stay for a little bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> longer I think like next time before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where to go I definitely want to maybe I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> mean I don't know what's anything else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I kind of like took you to like let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> say the more pristine clean areas uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> next time you're in Thailand we'd love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to say you to some of them all like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back-ends let's say like dirtier places </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because you can get a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> interesting things there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um do you guys have like a lot of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> islands and stuff like that oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a lot of the big tourist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> destinations are they're like really </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> sure yeah me too me too yeah I'll join </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you on that one yeah hell yeah I I it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was an interesting experience from like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the moment we got off the plane it felt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> very different this is the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've gone to a country in a while where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh I wasn't able to speak the language </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the language remotely so yeah you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because we've been doing America and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan which is like okay I know how to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> talk in Japan yeah yeah so it's kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> weird going to a place and being like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that guy again who couldn't he literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like please speak English I please I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> felt bad but it was what it was but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get off the plane and immediately I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think American uh immigration has ruined </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immigration for me which is I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> terrified right I was conditioned by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> America to be terrified yeah and when we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get to the passport gate they literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> look at the passport for like one second </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like get in yeah go go get inside with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you yeah in Thailand because like so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> much of our economy is tourism I'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that dude yeah I don't even like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> did they even ask me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no question the dude didn't even talk to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> silently grabbed my passport looked at </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> I was like damn I should just say I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> working let's see what happens </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> was the line long when you were when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> got in no it was super it was super </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> have anything so I went over to the SIM </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> card right it was like three of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they all look really sketchy I'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna lie yeah and uh I I'm like can I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have two SIM cards please it was like 10 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bucks each yeah and like yeah sure could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be your passport and then they would all </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> have to do this I'm like oh you're just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hot you know I don't know that's the </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> to charge me uh something like 60 bucks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like USD right I know from from what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've heard from Thailand that's that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in Thailand that's extortional yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is and I was like but will the taxi be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there right away and will will it be a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> big taxi because there's like there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a group of us and they were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yes I was like scam me take my money bro </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> ripoff but dude we literally rocked out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right away and it was all ready together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I think that's no question because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when I heard that from Connor right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again this is America corrupting my mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like oh 60 bucks for like what is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it like a 40 minute like taxi ride I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like all right yeah that's fine it was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> big van it was like a big van that could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know obviously fit all of us yeah um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but so you know in my head I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> okay yeah I mean that's not too bad but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then the second time we got onto the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taxi and the guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I saw 30 Baht was the starting price </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like it's like 80 cents yeah it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a 30 minute cab ride was like 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bucks I was like what the [ __ ] not even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like it was insane yeah it sounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like Japan could never yeah I mean like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh first rule when you come if you ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> come to Thailand and pretty much every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Southeast Asian country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> um if you get a taxi meter only like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if you really really need to they will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> try to like get a fixed price yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> noticed this yeah I'm trying to do I get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it I look white as [ __ ] I got it you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> should scam me yeah like he would I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like Hey I'm going here and he just said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> something I didn't get it I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like three or something guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> afterwards who's asking for like five </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> times the price up front and then I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> think like at one point we split up into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two taxis Joey went and then I went yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we all went the same direction and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> told him I wanted I wanted the meter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah he paid the 300. my thing came like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a hundred or something yeah so I paid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a third of what Joey to be fair </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that 300 Baht uh taxi ride I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because we were heading to uh the big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> markets I forgot what the name of it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> uh yeah that one right um so we were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> heading there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and I told the guy that you know we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were heading there and this guy clearly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was very excited right right that it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh he's taking a tourist right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so he was trying the entire 30-minute </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> taxi ride this guy was trying so hard to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sell me on this Market that we were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> heading but the only thing he could say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was 14 Market 14 market </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and he would just repeat that for 30 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes and I'm like yeah I get a borrow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's 14 of them I get it and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> every time I would respond he'd just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> laugh and Go Thailand happy happy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like I'm like yeah you see you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seem very happy about it yeah but uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah no it was like I think that's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one thing about like that I guess uh if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can call it the Southeast Asian like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> living experience right it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone's just so chill and it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like so happy that you're there they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like because you know you very rarely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> get anything like that in Japan right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like maybe in Okinawa right you would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> get someone that talkative and that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people are trying to express people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah that's that's one of the big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> reasons why I moved out of Thailand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> after living there for like three four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> years yeah nothing done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I noticed as well dude people just don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> indicate ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah they seem like a pointless thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like this dude we were like an hour ride </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't touch his [ __ ] indicators once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they would either not touch the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> indicator or when say they wanted to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Signal going into the left lane yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they would flick the indicator on for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> half a second yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like no one saw that literally literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the mood when you're driving into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Ireland it's just like who's gonna stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> me who's gonna stop me because because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> literally you just have to like go yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I swear it makes traffic slower </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because everyone's being selfish yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just slowing everything down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the moment the taxi just starts driving </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> off I can just see the objective survive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's so scary to be in the front </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like you are getting tantalizingly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> close to these like especially the bikes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as well oh my God I mean like I knew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> southeast Asia had a lot of bikes right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know I've been to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Philippines yeah but like Jesus Christ </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these bikes are [ __ ] speed demoning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> through these like trucks and all these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> taxis you know avoiding the lanes and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff like that I'm like how does how do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you how does anyone survive oh I mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's just like it like I said in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thailand and mostly Southeast Asian </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> countries you just need Ultra instincts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah she's like to like survive right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because this like you are constantly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just checking every mirror possible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's not the cars you need to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> worry about it's the motorcycle oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> okay I don't you know what I don't in in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the in the uh environment of driving in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Thailand I don't care if a car doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> indicate that's just normal you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> um but if you're changing a lane there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is you you always have this Instinct </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that there is going to be a motorcycle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> driving pass or a motorcycle doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> something bro some of these taxi drivers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> have like the periphery of a deer like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they just like they can see behind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> without looking back it's like yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> can see I can sense two bicycles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> concerning about the lack of indicating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like holy [ __ ] if you're driving on a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> motorbike my God you're just praying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that people aren't being dicks yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly and honestly like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thailand's one of those like Michael's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> one of those cities where you risk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people risk their lives daily going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> motorcycles me included uh because the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> traffic's so bad yes right and uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's some sometimes there's just no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> system in place right now bangkok's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> still very much a developing City yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh especially with this public transport </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that sometimes uh you choose getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuck in a traffic jam for two hours or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a 20 minute taxi ride which one are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you gonna take and you're like well I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> risking my life life but that 20 minute </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taxi right that 20 minute motorcycle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ride looks damn appealing right now man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ain't gonna lie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but yeah did you guys go on like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> tuk-tuks as well yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was interesting because again like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like a five minute ride and the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dude was like 300. I was like I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dude I'm like yeah this this looks like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it weighs 10 pounds there's no way the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> guess the gas usage in a year is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> probably not even 10 bucks what are you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talking about I saw I remember the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time we wrote the talk talks at night </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like Connor did like a full one game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> move and the guy was like 300 but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously you know we couldn't all fit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into one talk talk yeah I can only see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe like what three people at most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so we had to get two talks and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Conor did like a big movie where he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like all right let's do a package deal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah 500 for two well originally I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like 200 and even then I know 200 is too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> much stuff yeah I'm like hey you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scam me but just give me this I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to bother yeah I actually feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I belong here yeah yeah I bought it with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> him yeah obviously I knew I was getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> ripped off yeah I was like 200 and he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like no uh 250 and I was like 250 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for both and he's like all right sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then he shout to the dude who had no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> affiliation to him behind him being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we're taking them both for 250 yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't know what the guy said but I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could make it out pretty much he said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> follow me and make 250. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> he didn't tell him where we were going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to follow me and holy [ __ ] these things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> felt dangerous dude oh they are no seat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> belts you're holding on for dear life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the dude's going like 60 miles an hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like holy [ __ ] this is cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but oh my God I'm gonna die I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you saw but like before we went on to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> those two talks there was like a group </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of about six people in front of us right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I thought we had to wait a little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bit right because I saw like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> while we were driving on the road these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> talk to you know maybe fit two people on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> average right maybe three if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> squeezed in but there was a group of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about six of them they all got into one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tuk-tuk and they're just like he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally cramped in this tiny little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing and they're like yeah a hotel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> please I'm like bro </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> turn into a clown car dude sometimes it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is extremely tightly packed and I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like that I mean it's dangerous already </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah and that felt like why not why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> not add more risk yeah because I've seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like entire families get on these like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> motorcycles you know like yeah they put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like their two children at the front and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the the parents are sitting on and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> uh on top of that they have their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shopping on their like motorcycles they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are packing these things up to the brim </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I I it's just it just I think what blew </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my mind for one was just not only the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sheer amount of motorcycles that are on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the road but also just like how casual </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people are driving these things through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that environment like I remember I saw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know usually when you're on the back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of a motorcycle right yeah the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing is like you know make sure you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sitting in front you know holding on to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the driver right yeah maybe wearing a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> helmet if you want to be extra careful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wearing a helmet no first of all no one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was wearing a helmet second of all I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember I saw this woman who was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sitting to the side not holding on to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything just looking at a phone what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] oh no meanwhile this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> motorcycle's just it's just sitting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there like yeah all right tell me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know like Jason Bourne like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really like Chads in the movies when you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see the stunts he's doing on a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> motorcycle yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a nice ride yeah that's that's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty cool motorcycles yourself yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's actually a pretty normal way for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> women to sit on the motorcycles because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of times if they're wearing skirts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right like uh you know they want to they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> want to sit kind of like that because it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looks a bit more elegant and they don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> need to like but like at least you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if I if I had to sit like that I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> would at least like hold on to something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this one was just freehand one hand on a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> phone she looks like she was waiting for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a doctor like you know it was just the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most casual like yep all right uh I know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> my life's in danger right now but I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really gotta check Twitter you know I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just there's this bang it's weird I have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to retweet this right now yeah I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's it's definitely like no matter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> how much I have described it in the past </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's nothing that I can like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> replicate the feeling of just the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> insanity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Southeast Asian roads and just how the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rules work over there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um it's it's a free throw and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> always been a free-forow and and kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like every taxi you go to especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if you're gonna if you're a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> foreigner they're gonna try to battle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with you and they're trying you're gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> try and get the best price possible oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah dude everyone you've got us that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taxi dude it was like at the moment they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> saw us wanting a cab like yeah 20 dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spawned they were all shouting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like I don't know who you were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talking to I think you were talking to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the crowd and you were just like no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no it was weird it was just like God was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like I want a taxi yeah yeah it wasn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until a lot later maybe because I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drunk but it wasn't until a lot later I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> realized that they were all taxi drivers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought I thought we were just getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jumped by like 20 dudes I was like God </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're okay and I was like oh they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> all taxi drivers yeah because like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happens is obviously uh I took the um I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> took them to a place called Asiatique </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like a really nice bougie place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right by the river uh in Bangkok uh but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they needed to go home uh to the hotel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so I know how it works you go over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they see a group of tourists and like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> group like a group of NPCs basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> will just support you know and and uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> one of them comes up and goes like Oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 300 Baht and I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if you are willing to speak yeah I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like I am not a Taurus I I will not even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> attempt to like take this number can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> anyone say give me a better number and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as soon as I as soon as I just ignored </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the guy two other dudes would be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well we'll do it for half the price and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember I remember like uh turning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back to Conor and I'm and I'm like is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this price I gave for you and Connor's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like go go a bit lower go a bit and so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like I'm like okay I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> bother them yeah I was like I want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> see how good this bothering is right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and so uh Conor's like get it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lower and I was like actually I did not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> even she passed by the way no no no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> no no you just don't want to be ripped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the time I didn't want to have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to deal with change anyway I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just [ __ ] just yeah okay so so this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is what do they see how much he could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bother them I was I was curious for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah sometimes you seem like I'm like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I will not pay five bucks for taxes no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because uh like the thing is no matter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what price if if you agree on a price </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically if you could agree on a fixed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> price it's always going to be higher </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than the metered price no matter what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> otherwise it or not like it was like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 10 not even 10 like a seven minute </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Journey it would have been like 50 on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the meter yeah exactly so no matter what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you agree to so it's kind of like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> price you agreed to to just have the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> convenience of of of just being like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't be asked to deal with this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] let's just like agree for a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> prize just yeah it's basically paid away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so yeah Conor Conor I I kind of did them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a bit dirty a little bit because I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like bro come on I'm tired man come on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dude do me a favor do me a favor man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know you can you can go a </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> countries if you're speaking that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> language and if you're off their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nationality then they're gonna they're </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> too all right I mean Pad Thai is like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> traditional like of like a traditional </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Thai ceremony we could have just had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the reception everything like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but my parents were like no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um we want to do the traditional Thai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ceremony just because you've never seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it yeah so even though I'm like talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like about the Thai ceremony and this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your guys's first Thai ceremony it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> also my first Thai ceremony as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's interesting yeah yeah it was cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it was I don't know it was a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> more I guess not free-flowing it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the right word I guess more casual than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought it was going to be because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I'm because you know I've been to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like traditional Japanese weddings right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's like you know a 500 page </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> script that you have to follow right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah whereas like this one felt like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like as you said it was a wedding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of course but it was more like just a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> celebration of like family getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> together and just like shooting the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah which I think I really appreciated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because like I was expecting it to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like really super uptight and like very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> formal and you know they were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously very formal parts of it like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the Buddhist monk thing was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> super freaking cool yeah um but then you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know I had to do like 10 push-ups for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you as well which was weird yeah so to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to explain everything that kind of went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> down at this wedding so uh normally you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> start off in the morning and normally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the morning is the part where you do the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> serious kind of blessings that's right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh we started off at about like like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> before before anything actually these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two boys asked me what do I wear do I do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wear a suit or something like that or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Thai yeah and I was like no uh wear a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Hawaiian shirt Hawaiian shirts shorts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and thongs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> speaking my language exactly I mean it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's hard enough in Thailand man we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> were like no nobody wears suits we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going like all casual the only one who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really wore kind of a more traditional </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Thai attire uh was me and Sydney so we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> had gotten dressed early in the morning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and even then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what I wore in My Thai wedding compared </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to what I wore in my you know other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wedding uh in England was a lot less </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> layers it was just one kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> traditional Thai suit yeah and like very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very airy and baggy pants is cool they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were actually really comfy yeah I kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like after I like they I had the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> opportunity to get changed earlier in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the day but I was like I don't like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I kind of like this ride now it looks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really cool yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> um but one thing I kind of like wasn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> prepared for actually was uh uh this was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like my the only time that I had got my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> makeup done yeah I noticed you're doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> makeup and I was like wow God looks like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's been airbrushed yeah okay yeah is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> wearing makeup like a traditional thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or is that sound like your mom was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hey I got you hooked up honest you look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like as [ __ ] bro let me fix it yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> think I think uh for Thai weddings you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they most people wanted to look as good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as you can in photos and everything like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that but the difference is most people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> don't trust themselves some make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> themselves look as good as they can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um so my mum hired like a makeup artist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then the day before she was like Oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no you're getting your makeup done as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well I'm like what what do you mean I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> getting my wake up done and uh so yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got my makeup done I think God damn it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I gotta say he was eyebrows on fleek </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> girls </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> respect to you girls man holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> makeup is uncomfortable oh that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> awful wait so you got just like I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you got like your cheeks done and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> your eyes a little bit and the lip gloss </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as well the lip gloss was the thing that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like annoyed me the most oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you look like an ad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so I got I got ready and got my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> makeup done in the morning and then the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> monks came at around 10 o'clock </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and their ceremony they're you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> praying blessing ceremony lasts for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about 30 minutes to 45 minutes and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically they kind of just pray and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> give Their Blessings and everything like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I mean you boys it was very cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah well they started uh singing that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was pretty hype yeah that was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> cool it was so cool yeah because I I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember we were having this like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ceremony and obviously Sydney's parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and family were there as well and uh my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dad was like oh the my my uh Sydney's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mum and dad was like oh that was such a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beautiful part to uh such a beautiful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ceremony to be a part of thank you for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> inviting us and showing us part of your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> culture and everything and then Sydney's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uncle was also there and he just goes to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me man those monks got bars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like yeah yeah but it's it it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> makes sense it makes sense because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um I didn't realize this when I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you know I've been a monk and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything like that I didn't realize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this but there's a certain Rhythm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rhythmic quality wow when they are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> praying and everything uh because you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know there's how it works is there's is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only one head monk that starts off a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> verse let's say and they they say a few </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sentences they chant a few sentences of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this verse and then everyone else joins </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> us afterwards yeah and it's kind of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the whole reason why Buddhist monks pray </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is not because we're praying to a god or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything like that because we don't have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a God in Buddhism but it's it's kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get us in the rights mindsets to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meditate to be a monk and everything and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with I kind of realized after talking to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sydney's mum and dad why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the prayer kind of has this effect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because when you're praying when you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have that kind of rhythmic prayer going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on for like an hour sometimes your mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of goes into this hypnotic stance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> State it's like a trance it's like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trance yeah kind of and then that gives </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you that gets you into the right mindset </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to live the monk life and to meditate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> afterwards as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> um and yeah I think it's I'm really glad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've always got to experience it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it can be like a very powerful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience sometimes because that was we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> had 10 monks in just my house but in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> temple uh especially when I was among we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> had a we had a temple with a hundred </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> monks that sounds crazy yeah so you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in you're in the temple when this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> massive hall and then yeah you hear the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you hear the head monks start praying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and in my mind in my temple we needed to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know all of the prayers by heart right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I needed to memorize them so I need I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> knew when when the head monk started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> starting a line I would know when to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come in and I would know when to start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> praying as well and you all join in and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the ambience and the sounds that just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> vibrates throughout the entire Temple </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's something like some something I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't really explain via words but it it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feels really really powerful oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> even even just with the 10 monks in in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your house like it was yeah I mean like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just the fact that everyone was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know very silent and a lot of us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were like closing our eyes and you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um just trying to like take it all in it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like yeah I don't know it felt very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> otherworldly you know it was uh because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know because Japan has a similar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing as well yeah and like funerals and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff like that uh but yeah every time I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hear I don't know what it is every time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hear that sound it just puts me like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> can just feel my body floating away if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that makes sense you know it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> something about it and you don't even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to like know the words yeah at all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> either I mean they're not even speaking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Thai oh really it's like it's uh I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the language is like Sanskrit I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know what the English translation name </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of it is but it's it's like an ancient </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> language so okay yeah they're not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually they're not actually chanting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Thai it's uh it's a more older language </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> which is why you need to memorize it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right um which is why I need to memorize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it because I don't actually know what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they're saying it's it's an basically I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would say it's more equivalent to them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chanting Latin if we were in like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> European language right yeah I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to figure out when when I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> supposed to pray I was like everyone's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> face in their eyes okay okay yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so I want to be respectful guy was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just sitting there while I'm so like I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like all right well yeah yeah even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> though I don't personally you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> believe in it yeah I still like to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> respect in the culture especially if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're inviting me yeah no it was yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember that actually it was so funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you know when they started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chanting and you know most people in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> room were you know signed to pray yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and and I joined in and I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> halfway through I looked up and your mom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just standing there with me phone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just seem like Unstoppable and like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like no matter what is happening they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> will be doing what they want to do yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it could be like the most important </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing ever and they'll be like guys get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> closer I'm taking a shot you know it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like whoa there's like what oh wow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's such a power move no I'll I'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely get to that point because I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being that definitely reminded me of one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing uh which I'll get back to but um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah one I at the moment at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> beginning I was trying to like tell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sydney everything that she had to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything she could expect with the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> monk thing and then when when the mouse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got there I'm just like just follow my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lead Sydney there's too much going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there's one thing I forgot to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tell her about which is at the end </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um we light a candle uh for the Monk and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the monk like melts this wax onto like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> um a bowl of water which they will then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like spray onto US oh yeah right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> um I knew this was going to happen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because there's uh what do I call it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like I not exactly spray but there's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bunch of like sticks bundled up together </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that will they were dipped into the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> water they will pray bless the water </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> then can I flick it into like the onto </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the crowd sprinkle yeah like sprinkle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sprinkle uh Sydney didn't know this uh I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I knew this was coming so I've done this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> ever since I was kid and I and so I knew </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when when the when you when the monk is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about to kind of uh spray everyone just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put your head down put your head down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Sydney Sydney didn't know this so she </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was she was just praying in like a very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nice kind of mindset gets a face full of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> water from the market she's like she's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like Madame too soon because like we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were we were kind of in the back of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> whole thing when it happened and of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> course none of us knew that was coming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out here so I'm just like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> silently closing my eyes and praying and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> then I get the AOE splash down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like is this test like is am I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> am I supposed to just like remain calm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then everyone's just getting like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> splashed you didn't get it at all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no I didn't I heard like didus and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of make a noise yeah cause I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> behind you so I didn't get anything like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that yeah so you're you're in uh you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in the spouse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's a wide AOE dude oh my God </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then there was a there's a few other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ceremonies and stuff and uh there's one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing with like your elders or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um so after the monk thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um there's this ceremony uh then we get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the fun part there's a ceremony which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um is called uh Gun Mark which how can I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> describe this ceremony the best way I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can describe it it's kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> replicating old ancient traditions where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you present the groom to the household </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the brides right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um so what happens is uh you separate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the two households you separate the two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> families which is what we did Sydney's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> family was in my house and we had walked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to our neighbor's house yeah and if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can call that a house if you can call </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that a house yeah some some of our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> neighbors got pretty wild with their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> house more like a Disneyland looking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Place yeah it was kind of wild yeah I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was like what the hell yeah and so what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> happens is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um you separate the two houses you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the groom side and you have the bride </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> side and the whole concept is all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> groom side has to come together to help </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the groom kind of be able to prove to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the bride's family that they are worthy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to marry the bride right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um it was basically an escort Mission it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was an escort Mission thought like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> went my parents went full like force </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were there where they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um they hired like traditional dancers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and like traditional like musicians uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so we separated the houses and then you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> started off with like kind of like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> king kong Tarzan kind of chance yeah you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> by the front day we had like some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> traditional Thai dancers it felt super </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> weird yeah I'll I'll be honest crazy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're so fun though they were just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> go here guy yeah I was like what am I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing yeah I don't know what I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know what the [ __ ] is yeah economy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> indictis were given like a Play-Doh like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> desserts or something we're just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> hold this and I'm like I don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what's happening and then the drums </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> stopped playing I'm like oh okay I guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're going yeah and so basically my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> boys just escorted me to the the bride's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> house yeah and so you stop at the gate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and I thought I was meant to talk uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but no my mother my mother was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> apparently doing the one this is your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is your mom's honestly it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> step aside Sunday </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and she basically she has to kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like negotiate uh with the households to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like to kind of like let us into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the house right and uh with this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> procession there are like there are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three gates and there are different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> trials that we need to do at each gate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and these trials are picked like kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not really at random but I guess peaked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by like the the whoever's house oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the bride's house so there are different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like how it traditionally is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um because families are so big you'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have different members of the bride's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> house uh guarding each gate and they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> will ask the groom to do whatever they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> desire and this there's not like there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not anything on paper where you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> traditionally you need to do this it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just whatever they feel like asking for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right it's kind of like yourself yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like a little forfeit basically </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> to be it's kind of like kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're with your Bros and you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> invading a castle you know that's that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of how it's meant to feel West Side </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> I remember saying it's like oh it kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of feels like we're storming a castle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right now but there's a lot of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah there's a lot there's a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> people uh I'm sure your neighbors just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> joined in yeah yeah I don't even know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who these people were yeah yeah yeah uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was pretty easy and then the second </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um the second the second game was a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more tricky because uh my family member </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> alone you got to get your Bros involved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with this one I was like no I'm holding </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> push-ups and Connor dance why why do I </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> first it was like gone through 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> push-ups and we're all like yeah let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go not knowing that we're about to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> involved right yeah this is like another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 10. and the guy's like I'm like because </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> then you know [ __ ] Conor and dice are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like laughing at me right thinking that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're gone scot-free and then one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> them was like now one of you dance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> clown and so Connor it was the weirdest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing I wish I had filmed this part </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was it was so it was this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> bizarre situation of us and a hundred </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plus Thai people around us all watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor fortnite dance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's like a dream I can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> believe this has actually happened yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was all it really did feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like we were storming a castle except </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of was just Fortnight dancing in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> front of the gates because we there was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this one interrogating together there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was this one very small bridge between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the outside and the inside of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> house that was over a pond right and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Connor was just by himself on this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bridge it's in front of like a hundred </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of like my Thai family just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> fortnite I'm like I'm so glad to do the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> push-ups [ __ ] monks just left </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching me and I've got this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> traditional Thai dancers dudes playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these Thai instruments meanwhile she's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> white guy dancing wearing wearing jeans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah what a [ __ ] bridge in front of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 100 Thai people it was so funny it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weird experience yeah but thankfully my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bro's had my bag </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I got in the second gear and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> last gate was of course guarded by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sydney's family uh and they asked me to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> uh sing oh yeah uh sing the song that I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sang for my very first dance uh with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sydney uh which I'm pretty sure I sung </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> really really badly that's fine but it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> did I I forgot to mention even though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you had to do these trials it was it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally ended with a with a little bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of a bribe that's uh oh really yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I heard about that yeah did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> know because did you notice like when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were like okay you're worthy and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like okay thank you and I gave him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like an envelope yeah yeah she bribed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I was like yeah I like this culture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all I can say is you know Money Talks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you can be the most worthy man in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> world but you know a little bit of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> embarrass yourself and give us more if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you had to like barter like best I can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> do is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that happens actually yeah that happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 10 bucks it's like all right eight yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll take it or leave it boys we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> packing it up yeah spot out we didn't do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this for our wedding but my mom was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know traditionally sometimes it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really depends on the feeling of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whoever's got in the gate sometimes if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're feeling like oh this uh this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't look like enough money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> slip an extra like 100 200 bucks or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> something like that that's so funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's awesome so yeah it's it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not meant to be taken seriously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like it was a lot of fun yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> awful all for fun very casual </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> um and then after that uh is where you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had like the adult blessing ceremony </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is which is kind of what you see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with uh this yeah so what happens is you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh you go into another room and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> immediate family all will take a seat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and uh the basic the basic premise </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is every one who is part of your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> immediate family who is an elder to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> gets to bless your marriage which uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every everyone takes one of these one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these strings gives their blessings and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then literally like ties are not ties a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> knot for both me and for Sydney right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh I didn't know how long this was going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to last because yeah because I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you got a lot of Elders at the beginning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like you know Joey Connor died as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know Emily you know come in have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> look and they saw you know both of our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> parents blessing us tying the knots yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and then I forgot to tell them that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh this my entire family who was sitting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down waiting their turn they're gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come up and bless me as well so that you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> were there standing there for like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 15 minutes or something yeah it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 15-20 minutes before I was like oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> um you guys go away from now it's okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we're going to be here we're one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tenth of the way through right now yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so as as you can see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um I mean I I like I like the ceremony </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything but I'm glad that mostly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just my family there yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um because uh obviously a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sydney's family is in America uh because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if Sydney's family was there we would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> have been there for [ __ ] hours like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> your whole album with my whole um yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because uh Hey like everyone got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the chance to give that blessing and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can always tell when you've been to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a Thai wedding because this is kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a just marriage uh sorry just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> married kind of symbol because you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell Southeast Asian families their arm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just gets filled up I was gonna say most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people when they go to Southeast Asia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and they come back they only have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bunch of bands </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right lots of bracelets that was like um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some other ceremony where I think it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something to do with elders but it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't your dad and then your dad was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talking to me right and everyone was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being really quiet and I was like is it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay for you to talk this loudly to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then eventually your mom came up I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like shut up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not to me to your dad yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like everyone was quiet in this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> room watching uh I was one of your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> family uh like blasting you or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then yeah Dad just turns around and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> he goes are you enjoying Thailand so far </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like oh well you know like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> whisper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm getting the party started yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> then like in the meanwhile like there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally a line of my elders just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> waiting waiting to do it and my dad's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like we're gonna be here a while </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my God and then there was the one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after where with the water pouring one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah so after I got all my eldest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> blessing then we have the chance for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone else who came to their wedding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to give Their Blessings as well and so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh what happens is me and Sydney sat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and we had kind of like uh yeah we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had like a a vase with a flower in front </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of us and what the concept is is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people can pour water over our hands and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bless us for the start of a new marriage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah a lot of other things in Thailand a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of blessings every we are very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> blessed yeah you blessed we blessed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and you know everyone lines up once </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again and uh they take they take a kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of like a not a bucket of water but just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a little like vase of water and just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pour it over our hands and you can say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever you want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um I was there for me and Sydney were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there for like 40 minutes yeah what what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the the part that I thought was kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> funny was that like uh I think you it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was your mom or your aunt that said like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know to all the English speakers who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> are there like us was like okay uh so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you all have to line up in order from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> oldest to youngest and I'm like I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know 90 of the people here how the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> am I supposed to know who's older and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> younger than me so I'm just like I'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just wait till the end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guys can all go ahead but like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> remember I didn't know that we had to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like say something to you guys right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like as we were pouring the water so it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got to my tone and I'm just like oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I haven't thought about what to say to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you guys I don't remember what I said to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you but I said to Sydney I'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking what they're saying and I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I ended up just saying uh have a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> life and I'm like that sounds like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> threat enjoy the next 24 hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like I didn't mean it to say it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like that I'm just like I didn't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what to say and I'm just like oh [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> should have said that sorry have a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> life I was like have a good life what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the [ __ ] does that mean oh yeah no it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good though yeah but like I'm a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> man I I remember during because we were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sitting there for so long just getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just getting blessed um I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> turning to Sydney and I was like this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the weirdest signing ceremony I've ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've ever been to because it literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> felt like a signing session at a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> convention except everyone was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> washing my hands so many people washed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my hands this one at this one ceremony </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that my hands were wrinkly but oh yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got the prune yeah I had the prune </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hands all the way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah after that it was everything was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over and uh I guess that's when the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> party started yeah I remember when we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were waiting to this water thing and uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was even cut like a little cousin or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something who yeah my little cousin this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kid there's 10 10 11 year old Thai kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> speaks to me in like a Flawless American </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> accent and he was talking to me and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was like how do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how do you have an American accent he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh what's a lot of South Park and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Family Guy and I was like ah how would </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> good yeah you're so funny yeah it's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cool God I'm like I this uh being at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this family gathering being at this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wedding kind of like opened my eyes a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot because I talked I talked to a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of my younger family members uh one I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realized that a lot of my younger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cousins </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um they all I was like they were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> initially they were like oh I watched a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of YouTube I was like oh that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> makes sense and then I talked to them a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bit more about who who they watch or who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their favorite content creators were and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 90 of my cousins were like oh I watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTubers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember that because one of uh your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> cousins that was uh sitting with us for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> quite a while was really cool kid uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> overheard that conversation and he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> turned to me and he went what's a v </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trooper and I was like no no no no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you are the last innocent mind your mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> will not be don't do it don't do it do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it to yourself it's like promise me you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> will not look it up after this wedding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh there was this really awkward moment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I was having a conversation with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my cousin and my uncle was standing next </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for him as well yeah and uh my uh he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> telling me about how he uh watches </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube and something like that and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he says that he watches YouTubers and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then like a minute after that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> conversation ends my uncle comes up to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me and he goes uh can you explain why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like his he's always spending this stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on his bank account I don't understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like he's spending a lot on YouTube I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> don't understand and I was just like oh </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> oh no I was like oh no Uncle I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know how to explain this to you so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there's this goal right if I did it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> wouldn't help there's this girl been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> real but they're not real yeah oh my God </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I also realized um I also had the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realization of why I am so adamant on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> not taking pictures wherever I go and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> realized this because it's it's kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe like a kind of trauma I already </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know what you're gonna say or maybe like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a kind of trauma that has stuck with me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I this kind of like made me remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why I hate taking photos it's because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> every family gathering everyone wants to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> take a photo and there is never there is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never an opportunity to not take a photo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah your aunt was going insane yeah her </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> camera roll must go on for like years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> terabytes yeah because uh because at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this wedding I was like you know taking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a few photos and every time ever every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> single time I took a photo like three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more aunts or three more uncles I just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like okay can we take a photo as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can we can we take a photo and then so </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> traditional suit and get up and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything yeah Sydney was like sweating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> her ass off uh so we were just standing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there taking photos and as soon as we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought we had a moment to breathe we'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> walk Five Paces and then someone would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be like can we take a photo can we take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> another photo and we'd be like yes okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay you must yeah if you must and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> remember this was just how it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> growing up for me I I've grown up with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the sense that no matter where I go with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people someone's gonna take a photo so I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't need to take a photo so this is I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guess I remember I remember now why I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never take photos is because in my mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like someone's always there to take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a photo and there are going to be way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> too many there's always an aunt or an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uncle around the corner ready to take a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> photo yeah exactly I get that yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm glad you guys got to see my house in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Thailand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about that because I remember like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> were like all right so uh you know meet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up at the venue at x amount of time and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so you know we we told the taxi driver </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like take us to this venue and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they're taking us through these like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Backstreets and I'm like yeah yeah where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is this venue yeah and then I realized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your Venue is just your house and I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like why did you say venue you could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have just said house and I would have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> been less confused because along this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> road it was the weirdest Road right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like I guess we entered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like kind of the the nicer back streets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where like there's like tons of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> huge mansions with like extraordinarily </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like large ponds and lands and stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like that yeah and I don't know if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nothing in Thailand but there were so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> many statues of Pop Culture figures on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the streets that was there was a like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that was like a six foot bust of Captain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> America yeah in front of someone's house </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had to double take so many times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Captain America's just his like from his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> abs to his head yeah six foot statues </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there was like this like like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe three or four foot tall like Mario </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like porcelain statue yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um I I think it is just maybe not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> traditionally part of Thai culture but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just yeah all right yeah we're just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes you know Thai people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially you know people around me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes if you can just grab a cool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> little like ornament or like artifact or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something like that no matter how out of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> place it is you just put it there yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I I remember I get a six foot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like did you make that yeah because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember I I told that story to one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your cousins and I told him about the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mario one and he was like oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's a doctor yeah and I'm like didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> even get Dr Mario </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you [ __ ] up like it doesn't explain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> why he has a Mario in the front of his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Mansion yeah I think I think he just put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it like one of my other neighbors has a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] Jurassic Park theme yeah gate or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> something like that yeah Titus and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went walking in your neighborhood right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we just walked past this gate and it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was I'm like I'm not tripping that's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Jurassic Park logo on the gate and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I look over at the wall and it clearly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> says Jurassic Park and I'm like where am </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what is Thailand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah sometimes uh at least from you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my family and people I know sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Thai people especially when they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to like build a house or put some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cool things or kind of try to get away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to stand out they would just take a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> random thing from America or British </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> films or whatever and just put it in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> house doesn't match the aesthetic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't match the vibe at all sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just walking past the house and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you see a random Mario statue doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make any sense at all but that's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just the way things are just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like your neighbor's house that we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> started that uh the the ceremony in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> looked like every country put into one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> place like it was it was there was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a there was like an Amsterdam inspired </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> windmill next to a river and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like a very traditional like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Southeast Asian house and then there was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just straight up like a concrete block </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that looked like something out of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like Eastern Europe and I'm like what is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this place like what's the theming it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very unusual like how did the guy tell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the architect being like I want this I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want this I want this and the guy's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you want it all in the same property </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right like yeah it kind of feels like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> theme park you know because they're just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh just so just have a have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> little bit of everything why not I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought it was a theme park and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your cousin was like oh no this is the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> neighbor's house I'm like what does your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> neighbor do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it was insane it was very impressive so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> weird yeah thankfully none of my family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> served you boys uh bearing with ice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cubes in it yeah I was expecting it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought was unacceptable I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> could I have a beer please and so he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gives me a beer it gives me a straw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a straw for a canned beer I was like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like no thank you what what is this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> why do they drink beer out of a straw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what is that can you explain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um some people some people just do that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's [ __ ] up I don't know why what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the [ __ ] beer out of a straw I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's [ __ ] up as well uh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know I don't know I I yeah no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't Zone my guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not my meds I don't think there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was a moment where I like in the 72 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hours where I was in Thailand where I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't disgustingly full I think I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> full constantly I think every moment I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was with these boys because I only got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to take care of these boys one at my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wedding and one another day when I could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> show them around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um I think every hour I was with these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boys we were eating something because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything's so good yeah nothing missed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember at the wedding uh I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> your your aunt brought out these like uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like sautes uh like chickens on a skewer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the chicken satay skewers and they're a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> bomb dude I swear I saw Connor eat like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 50 of those like not not even not even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> over exaggerating I think he actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ate like four full plates of that [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> had a lot and they just kept bringing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> them over when I was finished and I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh [ __ ] I can't let them get away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> see I thought Connor wasn't eating much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh because I was like talking to my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> family and everything and every time I'd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come to cut like your table Connor had a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> false uh place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with Satay every time so I just assumed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh it's the same plate no he was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> eating it so fast but you didn't see it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and even though I was full they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> started making other food and I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well I have to try it yeah the moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you came back with the guitar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just I was so full and I still ate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a whole kapow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I the question I got the most in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thailand every every single [ __ ] time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I got any food they were like are you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure it's spicy they asked me this every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] every food I ordered they were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like are you sure this is spicy yes I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure give it to me on the airline or any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any [ __ ] stall yeah a pad thai that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't even spicy they're like are you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sure it's spicy I was like no it's fine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can eat it I wouldn't have ordered it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if I couldn't yeah but because like Thai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Thailand you just assume everything is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> spicy I remember I took these boys it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like kind of like a casual place where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they serve like barbecue pork and some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chicken and stuff like that came with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three sauces </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and I remember Joey and uh diet is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> asking me oh this is this like different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> splice levels and I'd been in and I had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been abroad for so long so I assumed it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just different spice levels and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we were all like progressively trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the three different sources trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to figure out which one was the spiciest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one right and then Joey was like oh I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think the middle one's the spiciest one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is like I think the left one's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> spiciest one and then I tried it and I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like wait I think they were all the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amount of spice I think it's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> difference is the sweetness of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually which just goes in Thailand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's only one level of spice it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just spicy it's just spicy Dom was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sweating non-stop yeah bro he was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> wet the the squid uh like dish that you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guys had at your wedding oh yeah the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spices yeah that was that was probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the spiciest one I mean you know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> had a kick though but you know I I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fine Connor was fine I guess didus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really likes squid yeah and uh and he he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> put maybe half of his plate full of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> squid not knowing that it was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spiciest thing dog author he finished it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he looked like he just came out of a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sauna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> physically dripping he's so funny I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like are you okay did you just like run </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a half marathon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I mean because I was telling this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to Joey earlier because I was I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> surprised I think Joey's got you've gone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on like a lot better handling yourself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> compared to I surprised myself yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because you handled a lot of the Thai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> food pretty well I remember I remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saying I think with Thai food there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a perfect amount of spice with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> certain dishes people will just make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dishes with the amount of splice it has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that it has and you can last for it to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be less spicy but I think by asking it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be less spicy or removing some of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> flavor out of it for sure you're also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> asking it to be less tasty yeah you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> asking for it to be less tasty they can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make it less spicy but the reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's always going to be a little bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of spice in it even if you ask for Thai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> food to be less spicy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um it's because I think there is just a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> perfect amount of splice level for this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> food that makes it the optimal taste and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that unfortunately is it's too spicy for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of people um so good though yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's so good yeah oh man I was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> full the whole time yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh after about three days three days in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Thailand by the way there wasn't a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> single day in Thailand well I did not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have uh the most horrendously spicy food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when when the moment me and Sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stepped off the plane we were just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just go to town just just go to town let </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give us all of the spicy food that we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't get in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> um and so by day three my [ __ ] was no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> crying dude I I was struggling yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> needed I had like I would [ __ ] like 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> times a day every time yeah yeah my ass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like Mount Saint Helen yeah yeah it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was insane it was so sore and so and so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here are um at my house sitting on my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> toilet and I I was having I was having </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of those shits where it was like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> sweats that came with it you know that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> take your shirt off yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I remember just sitting down I and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reached over for the bidet and it wasn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there and I was just like if there's one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> country that needs a bidet it's Thailand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> why is it not here right now the spice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they use I'm shocked in their butthole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah people just getting used to it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that is that that poops normal or is it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is everyone pooping like that or maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in Thailand the general consensus is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah poops are painful right yeah that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the default I don't know I mean I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> think I ever got used to it I just fight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for my life yeah you just get used to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like fine for your life we do have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a sort of like bidet kind of thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in Thailand but that that didn't do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it literally literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I needed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need it you shouldn't sniper right to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where the I'm trying to like fully </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> shower my ass cheeks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah exactly that was not gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> work yeah we they they are they had like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a hose you could shotgun your ass I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> needed a Precision sniper right where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the area that was on [ __ ] fire and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just wasn't there so the first thing I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did was I'm like Mom can I buy a bidet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for this house please </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I need it okay in Thailand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where else did you guys go like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what areas did you guys so the day after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the wedding the day you didn't join us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we we obviously went to the the big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Marketplace which is which is super cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean like we I don't think we even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> explored like 10 of that place because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's right so massive yeah um but yes we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> paid uh 25 for a pad yeah yeah yeah oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> okay okay so we paid that and we were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like all right well let's get out of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here before we get scanned more so we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> went to um this uh the seon Paragon I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think yeah the same Paragon which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a kind of a mall nearby </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um did a bit of shopping there and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I guess just for the rest of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> night we were just there we went back to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that uh uh bar in The Hangover yeah oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because when I when I heard that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you guys were staying in labua I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh you you guys are staying in it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the most famous hotels in Bangkok </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> specifically because that's the hotel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where they filmed the hangover too that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scene at the end where the helicopter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> comes on the rooftop that's the bar that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's filmed at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and I know this uh because I assume </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything there was horrendously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> overpriced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> specifically because this is where The </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Hangover 2 took place dude we're looking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the menu and Emily's like I think I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna get this streak I'm like Emily </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a hundred dollar drink she was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I'm not gonna get that drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the cheapest drinks they had were 40 USD </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah we paid 40 bucks for a gin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and tonic and if you wanted to see the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> view we're like one drink we'll check </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out the view we'll bounce because you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the like 65th floor overlooking the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> whole series The View was amazing but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're definitely paying for the viewers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean at least it I mean it was one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the strongest gin and tonics I had so I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guess you know it wasn't worth it they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> were trying to level it out but I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's still 40 and I'm like yeah yeah uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know I'll just take a couple of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> pictures up here and then yeah yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was was it what was the hotel worth it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no I didn't like it their room was buggy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as hell I don't know dude like our hotel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> room it was like if you want to take a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shower yeah it was just like every five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> seconds was a quick Time Event because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you just change the temperature because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it would just scold you randomly you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> need to keep changing it I was like what </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> dude it was like it was a nightmare good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to know and it was so expensive yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I I've never stayed at that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hotel before because it is one of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most expensive hotels in Bangkok because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like like I said because simply because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of The Hangover too simply because of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the marketing they got for that it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like that prices rocketed it is a high </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> price for Thailand it's like 200 bucks a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> night yeah which is you know I mean in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the UK they get you nothing yeah that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't even get you an airbag okay so I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like oh okay I'll spend 200 bucks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again like a really nice room yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> think it was going to be like goaded and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was it was not very good okay okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they're they're probably a lot better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hotels that you can get for a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cheaper honestly the first time yeah we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> stayed in this other hotel that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> close to God's house for the wedding and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was like I think 40 or 50 a night </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was so good it was so much better and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the bed was amazing the service was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> super good and then we ordered room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> service and the room service was so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> cheap it was like it was like five bucks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like all the means what the [ __ ] we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought I am I suck so we ordered it it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was so good yeah it was really cool I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> ordered green curry that cost like 180 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bar yeah and I was like what how does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that make any sense how are they making </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> money okay that's okay that's good to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know because the hotel's really good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um just just because yeah um I have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> never stayed in the Burr I've always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I've always been curious because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the most expensive one but the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> breakfast was good though yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> about it yeah that's about it yeah I I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't really think it's worth it to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> honest okay yeah next time you go we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like we go we'll get a different we'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stay at that first hotel honestly that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I know some like pretty good hotels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um that are a bit less than liberal but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like even better than the other Hotel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay I recommended for you yeah I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think three days is a pretty good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> amount though I felt like I kind of had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially the food yeah I think my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> stomach was like begging me to stop yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so I think three days was perfect how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> does anyone stay in shape in Thailand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like I would I would be fat as [ __ ] if I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lived in Thailand for like more than a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> month dude it's all like you get all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> manga go smoothies yeah and goes </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> because it's just white ice cream right </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> he's like I think it's vanilla yeah I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what do you mean you think it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> vanilla I had a scoop and I'm like this </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> didn't really like it I'm like you ate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole thing though you're such a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] liar how does your brain off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I'm glad you enjoyed the Thai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sausage though that was so good as the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> biggest sausage connoisseur [ __ ] love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sausages yeah JoJo fan yeah and I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously if you ever had Thai sausage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> um it doesn't taste like a normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sausage it's very spicy see very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> flavorful as it is yeah I don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I feel like it wasn't oh man that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the word it doesn't have that like super </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> nice bite to it that some sausages have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but the flavors of the spices in it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> were insane yeah it kind of made me like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like seeing seeing you I was gonna say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seeing you seeing you enjoy that sausage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh yes and kind of like being back in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time I kind of made me realize why Thai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Cuisine is the way it is just because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> compared to you know more developed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> countries the meat quality isn't the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> best yeah right but we kind of like make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> up for that by just making the flavors </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so strong for sure uh that's it's kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of almost the opposite of Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cuisine Japanese Cuisine is all about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> letting the letting the meat quality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> letting the quality of the ingredients </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> do that one yeah letting natural flavors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> take over time sure Thai is more like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this how many [ __ ] spices can we put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in this get it give it give me more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spices </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh so good yeah I heard uh online before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you go to Talent you weren't supposed to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> drink the tap water or avoid ice yeah it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was impossible to avoid ice ice was in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> everything they put ice in everything so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's this is more of like in the river </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> areas okay uh it's also on the food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> stalls in in the food stores if you if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you buy stuff in the food and they have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a bucket full of ice or something that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably from tap water but if you're in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a mall or in the hotel or you know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> icicle at my wedding that's that's ice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we've specifically bought that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> been like purified I mean I thought I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was gonna get hit for sure with the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> amount of mango and watermelon smoothies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was drinking but I was good this time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I pulled the good RNG yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every time we'd go to a food food store </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> start so I've I you know I rent cars in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan fairly often I've rented a car in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan from this one location at least 10 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> plus times I've been there so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> goddamn times and I you know I just know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who you are now I've been there so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> times right so when you book a car in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan if it's winter season you probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to just get snow tires just in case </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you don't you don't know where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you're going right and I always I always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get snow ties always and psychos no ties </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a rock up to the rental car place and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's 8 A.M and we're gonna get going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like our video we're like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tight schedule we gotta get to the next </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> place it's about two hour driveway and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh as we're in Japan one question </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll ask you when you rent a car is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> normally they'll ask you where are you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going and it's normally a chill thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they normally kind of don't care it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not like American tea yeah it's yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not they like sometimes they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll they'll be a bit persistent </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> Translating thing and he goes basically </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> it so uh and I just got like a normal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ass small car I thought okay [ __ ] well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with no snow tires well I I clicked snow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ties right so I was like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he said you can't take this car okay so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what we can do is if you come back in an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hour we'll get this car and he points at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this card I look down I'm like yeah this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that's an eight-seater I don't need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it that's massive I do not want to take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this so we're going down like small </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> roads either and he's like oh I mean we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't do anything we can't we can't let </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have the cars right what I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fine I'll take the eight seater then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what can I do right I've got to go and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was double the price yeah and yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I had to pay for it even though I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't my [ __ ] fault so like we walk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out and as we're walking out the guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> starts running </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right what's up he's like oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there was no tires on the car </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like what I just lied to you he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> thought he I think they [ __ ] up and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they just misread there was no ties on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the [ __ ] car this whole time right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like oh my God okay fine all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right so we go back in oh my good at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> least I can get the car </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um and they do something they've never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> done before they've they asked me for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like my passport and stuff which they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> never asked me for okay because I I you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know you live in Japan and it's given </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the zaidu card right yeah well so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally even with that right if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> have a Japanese driving license which I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do they normally don't need anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> else yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and if you're a resident in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if you go to hotels if I'm correct </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to look at this I don't know to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> my knowledge if you are a resident in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan they shouldn't be asking you for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like passport or zaru card even when you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> check into a hotel oh you always do yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because if you're a Japanese person I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never get asked yeah right right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're not supposed to ask you but they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> do good for you when you're a foreigner </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> even if you live in Japan I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of kind of annoying but it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what it is and same with rental cars if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if you have a Japanese driving license </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they shouldn't require anything else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because if you live in Japan that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably your ID anyway yeah right so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the dude started asking me for my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> passport and I was like bro what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] I've literally rented cars I live </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here like 10 times and you've never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> asked me for this [ __ ] what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's like whoa is like yeah fine dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come on what the [ __ ] yeah sorry I get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it it's whatever we're going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then we're driving and there's no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> snow anywhere in gunma there's no snow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at all I'm like well this is it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] waste of time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then we're staying in a ryokan for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the night and I see where the ryokan is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like there's all these roads </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around and there's this big black empty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> area and it's just a mountain and our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ryokan is right in the middle on top of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this mountain right I'm like well I mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how bad can it be so we start we start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> driving and as we start making our way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up this mountain it's 50 minutes from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the bottom of the mountain to the top of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the real castle geez wow and there's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> giant frozen lake at the top all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so we're driving and the snow starts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get like bigger and bigger and bigger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and 10 minutes into driving this and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's literally like Initial D like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the like the roads just like this yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> going up it's like if you if you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drifting it'd be Heaven yeah you're just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drifting the whole thing right and as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're 10 minutes into this drive there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is a car that is sideways in the road </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is skid out and spun out right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like oh okay okay guys don't worry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm a good driver I'm good I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so we're going up and it's all kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a little dicey like you can feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the car is kind of like skidding a tiny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> bit here and there and you're like okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come on come on Carl you got this we get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up and it's fine but I'm worried about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the next day so I'm like we're gonna go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> video back down yeah and it's snowing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah overnight yeah so I was like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the car she's like can you can you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back the car up a little bit more in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> parking lot and I'm trying to back it up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the car just can't move it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuck yeah because there's just so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> snow and I'm like I'm like assume I said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> uh it won't it won't go it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happening she's like she's like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> fine get out yeah so next day we do film </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the stuff and we're ready to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we go down and we start driving and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I noticed that like I'm like hey guys uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't avoid you anything but uh we can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stop the car the car cannot break so so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we literally have to just go down this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without fully coming trying to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interesting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a weekend break right because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know your brakes in the Cobblestone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but it won't slow down Beyond like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 20 or 30 kilometers an hour yeah Jesus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so you're pretty much stuck at that and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if you try to stop the Cobble skit app </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right because it doesn't want to right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because the car doesn't want to do it so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like well don't worry guys 30 is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really reasonable speed and we'll be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fine and there's some turns where the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> car you can feel it start to go like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this just sliding you're like no guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't other guys I've drifted before I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it does we'll be fine I know how to turn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into the drift this is fine I know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm doing I didn't really know what I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was doing but I was like yeah it's fine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's fine we'll just we'll go slow and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you pump the brakes every now and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just slow it down don't don't try and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> harshly break and then we there was this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> car in front of us at one point I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know how this car was there yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we're going down this pretty steep hill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I noticed the car is just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stopping and I'm like uh okay and so I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to slow down and I'm like how the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] has he stopped I can't stop like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> literally cannot stop the car right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just getting slowly closer to this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> card I'm like well [ __ ] we're like 30 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> meters away from this car and I I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the [ __ ] do I do because I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking in my head I'm like man I can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stop the car pretty sure if I slam the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> handbrake that's going to make it worse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um so I look if there's any other cars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> coming and I I'm like all right well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's go in the other side of the road </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I I know the choice I couldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stop and I want to hit this guy yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I turned on the other side of the road </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the car is like uh I don't like that but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we managed to keep it safe we'd steer in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we'd steer back in it was all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chilled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this dude just stopped in the middle of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the road I don't know why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> unfortunate and another car came at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> same time it's like oh I have to hit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> something yeah like what do I what do I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hit like so you're driving in winter is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scary be very careful Jesus but luckily </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we made it down no problem a little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> scary was totally chill good stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's pretty why they wanted my ID I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think I think they were like this this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> motherfucker's gonna crash this car </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where is this where is this guy going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah why isn't he snow tires she's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> surprise it was kind of crazy that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> terrifying yeah but luckily it all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> turned out okay uh I think we're pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm pretty good Under Pressure I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd have a freak out so I'm pretty good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at trying to manage the situation but it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was it was scary still especially when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's other people in the car like if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I question it's me I'm like this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is fully all insured as long as I'm good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we were going like 10 miles an hour I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like we'll be fine yeah if I should all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> scare them and Scar them I gotta drive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> again he's just like I can drift guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're all just like we're gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> die </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like other than that Carl was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're driving fantastic car like thank </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you can we just don't talk about the eye </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> section </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what the snow areas yeah so be careful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you drive in Japan really make sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you look where you're going because no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> ties are good but they can't do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> everything yeah I genuinely think that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that road was just like you needed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> chains to like oh yeah I was gonna say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like did they not give you change no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can't you couldn't rent them oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I wouldn't even know how to put them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on I've never put chains on my car oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you can render but you have to tell them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a month you film a month in advance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because it's the snow season oh my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> God these these [ __ ] didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even know you needed snow tires when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come in so you know what makes you think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they're gonna have changed yeah I I it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was it was luckily the snow was light </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> enough where the snow tires were fine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but if it had snowed anymore I think it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> would have just it would just have to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like sorry we can't go up there yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just too it's too bad geez you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't stop it's scary it's pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] yeah because I mean like I I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> went up to go see my grandma </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um you know up in Sendai to steep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're very steep yeah and like the the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> town where like I kind of grew up I went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there and uh I'd never seen that much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> snow in my life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but like I mean Sendai can get some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> snowfall but like the the zole like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mountain range stops a lot in the snow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah like it's a lot though so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like so when I saw that there was like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good 30 40 centimeters on the road I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this is unprecedented like it must </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> be like this winter has been absolutely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] for Japan right now amazing for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the ski Fields but I'm not going to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ski Fields this season because it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> full of Australians yeah it's also no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> offense Australia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's also crazy how you you're going so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> careful on this road and then of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the public bus driver will be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] multi-track drifting going down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it like it is sleeping I'm like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> eyes closed dog I've been doing this my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> whole life yeah because I know I did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> notice that like the week before we had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like a cold front or something yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dropped like 10 degrees Yeah Yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we uh we had a trip planned to Sapporo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when Sydney's family was in the country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and we had to cancel that yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um which you know it turned out to be a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> blessing in disguise because they really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we went ended up going to yamanashi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a little bit like yeah much much warmer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh no snow there still very very cold </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but just no snow or anything like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah um ended up having a fantastic time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well yeah another thing I noticed uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taking Sydney's family around the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> countryside </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um for some reason okay for some reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously yamanashi I don't think it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of like foreign tourists compared to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Tokyo Osaka maybe yeah maybe Mount Fuji </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we weren't we weren't near anywhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like too close to Mount Fuji </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um so we went we showed them to a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> our you know favorite wineries where me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Sydney would go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um since you know that's kind of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> area we know best </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and as soon as a lot of these local </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese people saw that there were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> foreign tourists of course they'd be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> scared at first but as soon as they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could tell me the city started speaking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese like for some reason the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> combination of foreign tourists and a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> few of them that could speak Japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they went from Super scared to inviting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> us to see like some of the most intimate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> parts of their like establishments and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> houses I don't know what this switch was </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> made in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's probably the safest country in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> world to go into someone's shed and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> drink their alcohol yeah still I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know I mean I would get it if it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know a gin Distillery right but </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> give credit to the uh I'm just Clowning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> on the whole shed part but yeah I mean </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> as well that's just run by an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um American dude it's super super </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> that's right that's right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was that was in this Brewery we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> found out you had to drive up a mountain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up a really really steep Mountain same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of mountain roads and he is just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this sounds like he's living his best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> life yeah there's just this random dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was that just had a bunch of loud </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he built his house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um on this land kind of like raised the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> family there uh and uh one day like his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> mates were gassing him up that there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were no good craft beer places in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they were like kind of gassing him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> up to be like you could do it you could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do it so he just went [ __ ] it I'll do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> myself and he just literally went [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it I'll do it myself built his own brew </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> house right right on this mountain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bruises on a chair and I was talking to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> him and he [ __ ] incredible story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where he was just like yeah I just I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just built uh built this brew house all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by myself uh designed it myself and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything what an absolute shot great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] beers hell yeah yeah so you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you can find the most random things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes just in the middle of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> countryside yeah talking around like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> finding like run artifacts these exist I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like the most in Japan if anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah where you just you go to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the most remote places and there'll just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be this really weird random sight there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you know I mean you know we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experienced that on the the road trip </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> special right like that [ __ ] Maui uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sorry the uh the Easter Island heads in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the middle of that like that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> literally in like it was kind of hard to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> show in the video but that was truly in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the middle of fall it was out there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there was nothing else around us it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just there yeah and there's so many like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe not to that scale but yeah as God </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was saying like there's so many like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> either tiny restaurants or like bars or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like where I'm like how the [ __ ] are you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> making any money out here yeah it's odd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you maybe encounter like one person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> every two weeks yeah it's like you run a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> business out here like okay yeah I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sure low cost of living kind of offsets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that a little bit but I'm like that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this uh still a big pleasure running </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah now cheap it is to run </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> businesses out here yeah it must be for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my word of mouth or something yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because otherwise some of these places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is just be like you would never be able </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to find it otherwise yeah glad to say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um despite not not despite but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or after the first day Sydney's parents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very very much enjoyed Japan and uh they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after the weirdness of the after the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weirdness of the first day the girls </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> buying everything I kind of like I kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of think it was a trial by fire because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had a pretty normal trip afterwards </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but after the trial by fire they just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enjoyed every aspect of Japanese culture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's good kind of a simulated I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know if assimilated was is the right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> word but kind of got used to it very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very quickly so hopefully your parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have a similar experience yeah they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> coming on April so it'd be interesting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to see do you have anywhere you're going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to take them like you've already feed it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> out or no I haven't I don't know where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to take them what are they I don't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to go Kyoto but I know they want to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> kyotube maybe I can just send them off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [Applause] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in April it's gonna be so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> soft oh yeah because that's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> haunted me yeah I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have a few days where you take them to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the tourist spots because that's what we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did with his family but you're like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> uh contrast that with just somewhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> outside in the country maybe yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something like that yeah I mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> April's a good time to drive around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan yeah the roads are nice it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really easy why this perfect so I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely gonna drive them around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> somewhere I haven't decided where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um if you want something close by maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like hakone like around there would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> nice yeah I mean I mean you could drive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to yeah you could drive to Kyoto or that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of area it's kind of fun drive yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's long yeah when uh winter Onsen with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> my father and uncle in law now did they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it they've they absolutely loved it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they didn't mind getting naked I had to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> do a little bit of convincing honestly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like the hardest part it's always the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> bit before okay so here's here's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing when we're in Tokyo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and we had to cancel a supper or a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trip yeah they were like just book us a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normal hotel and so they left the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> booking to me they wanted just a normal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Hotel I tried to sell them the idea of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the Onsen beforehand and they were just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's fun you do have to peer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> pressure yeah yeah you feel like it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> really bad producer Get Naked Now show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> me your teeth trust me it's good so I I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did uh did a little bit of a white lie I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was like there's only uh one place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's open right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> turned out to be a nonsense there were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually other hotels in the area that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were more traditional without nonsense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was all like kind of the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> price I was like I'm gonna go for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Onsen and uh see where it takes us so I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> booked the Onsen and we were there they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really really loved the more traditional </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese place I think you know I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if they if they hadn't experienced that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they wouldn't have known what they were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> missing kind of and so when I saw them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really enjoying like the more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> traditional Vibes and everything I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I think I can get them so I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> remember going to this Brewery with them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we I gotta got a bit toasted and on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the journey back I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't you guys feel like a nice warm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bath right now I'm just saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just saying hear me out I'm gonna go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right now it's gonna be one of the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> relaxing balls I've taken of my lives </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys can join me no pressure at all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> again now exactly and you know what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after uh after a long walk and a few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> good beers that sounds like a really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> really nice idea so just all it needed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was a little bit of a little bit of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> convincing and then why do you do like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tickle on them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's how it is let me stick with the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> balls just a little bit but uh yeah no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> awkwardness at all no yeah even though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like you know technically like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> family members now no awkwardness at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone enjoyed the Onsen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know it really does change the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> moment you step foot in the water yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> honestly oh this was worse have you had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this conversation with people like can I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> wear can I wear like swim shorts yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you cannot wear swim shorts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no you you can't wear swim shorts you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not allowed do you always lose shorts in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your bath that's like more offensive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't wear just don't do it like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> can't go in with swim shorts I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why I'm like I I don't know how to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> explain it to you it's a it's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> culture I don't know just get your [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out and shut up just put your balls on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the back trust me it'll make sense when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're in all right like don't don't be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coming in with swimsuit yeah an old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese lady will come in and kill you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like why like because it's because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the view it is like you've got to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clean you kind of foreign objects going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like dirty yeah no it's not dirty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you probably washed them but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not how it works like you can't you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not allowed okay yeah I don't I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> come into your house making up rules </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about who can go and walk back yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> follow their rules like I get it you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not comfortable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like I do it yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know it definitely I don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if it is like a mental thing but it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely feels a lot cleaner being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> naked because I remember when I when I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> went back to England I went to your bath </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we went to like one of the Spas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there uh and they have like they have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like very kind of like similar Spas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's kind of not just a pool but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like I call it a hot tub yeah because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're still in there with shorts and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just something about being there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in shorts and seeing other people in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shorts that it just maybe it's a mental </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> thing but it definitely doesn't feel as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> refreshing or as clean yeah you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's especially when everyone has to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bathe before they can enter as well yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's that's also important </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah I'm gonna try and get my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> parents to go one we'll see what they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> say yeah I'm doubtful I feel like my I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> explained the idea of my mum she seemed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really against it she seemed like no I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't do that yeah no no my dad I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my dad is probably he I think he wanted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to seem chill but I feel like he won't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it either </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah if I tell them it's the culture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll be like I guess yeah there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like there is nothing you can do about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it it is the culture just stuff that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I have to eat this yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you will you literally get stabbed by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the sushi chef if you don't finish this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just just put them in a situation when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it onto and just feels really enticing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because as soon as you get them in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> mindset to be like just gas them up a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> little bit yeah I'll just be like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> beer afterwards is going to be the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> refreshing beer of your life which it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I gotta think of new names for fish to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> lie to them so they don't know what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actual fish is because if I tell them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what it is they won't eat it I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I went to a sushi restaurant yesterday </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and they served eel yeah and it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really really good it didn't it tastes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so meaty yeah and I know that if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> tell someone it's ill they'll be like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah but it looks like and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> concept honestly I don't know how he did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this but this eel looked like a piece of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mackerel yeah on top and I was like huh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just tell them it's mackerel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> everything's mackerel just be like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't have an English name it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> called unagi let's just see this yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like but what does that translate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> some of them I know they're probably not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna like I'll be surprised if they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like sea urchin because I don't like sea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> urchin that [ __ ] well yeah yeah I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like with things like with things like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sea urchin and even like salmon Roe for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of people it's like it's a lot for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> people yeah we'll see we'll see I'll see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah they probably want to go Kyoto </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there and I'm again I'm dreading that I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't I really don't wanna I'm thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I might try and be like you've been in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan a week now you're ready </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just I Kyoto is a really cool place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I've only been with them when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's no tourists and even then it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> felt like a lot I don't know why kid is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cool but I'm I just don't think it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like my kind of place almost like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> way more my speed yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what a weird Leaf feels like a theme </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> park in a lot of ways yeah where it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's like it doesn't feel like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> very authentic Japanese experience even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> though it's the most authentic thing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> feels super stiff super I mean it is old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> school but like it has that Vibe and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like me personally I like the just the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the laid backness of other areas of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan a lot more yeah oh no I totally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get that feel because uh actually when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you guys came to Thailand and I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thinking about where I could take you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guys I already wanted to take you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a lot of like temples in Bangkok </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right but there's just something about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the vibe where you take you take you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know people were visiting to a temple </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know the architecture [ __ ] we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> saw some of them yeah beautiful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> beautiful all gold and everything but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just so many tourists so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people just taking pictures it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you kind of like lose a little bit of a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sense of what made this what makes this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> place so amazing in the first place in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my opinion and I get that same kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feeling with Kyoto as well where it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> super cool to see when the streets were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> empty and there was like no one there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously bad for the city bad for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> business there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> um but honestly I I've like I I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enjoyed just going to some other temples </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in Japan where it's a bit more isolated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah and Kyoto prices are nuts yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the uh ryokans and hotels and Kyoto are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so expensive oh yeah yeah so far like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that that whole area though like NADA </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Osaka as well is like they all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Uprising for that I've never been to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Nara and I I don't care about feeding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> these deer why do people care so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about this to be fair not uh I think out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of all the prefixes I've been to Nada </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was probably the most underwhelming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like you could feed elsewhere </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay look like you know as someone who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> loves animals feeding the deer it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty hype it's pretty fun especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you go with a bunch of people who are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know not that good with animals </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and seeing them [ __ ] their pants is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really fun but other than that and the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> giant uh the massive uh bronze Buddha </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> statue that they have there there isn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> really a whole lot to do in Nara if I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being honest like it's it's kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> underwhelming that like there's maybe a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> couple of like dishes that you can only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get in Nara but it's not anything like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I'm blowing if you ask me like most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if you want the good food you just go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Osaka and if you want the culture you go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to Kyoto it's like nara's kind of in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> middle of that and it's not really yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean I I think we've been living here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> long enough where I just enjoy just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> driving around small areas yeah just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seeing all the weird stuff they have and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just kind of checking that out it's way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> way more fun I agree it's a touristy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> places especially because we've lived </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here and obviously if you come here the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first time you should go and do the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> touristy stuff because it's cool it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> cool if you're going for the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go to kodo go to nargo's awesome yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they're awesome but yeah after a while </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you just be like I think I'm good yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just yeah just driving around is my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> favorite part as well yeah yeah you'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drive more gone I'm looking for more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> opportunities I'm glad I'm glad I got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> one you know with this but you know yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> next time as well next time next time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> can't relate yeah so uh I was the movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the other day that I think YouTube I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like the way you said that like it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an impressive thing because you know I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> watched a movie yesterday </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> um I think it'd be a movie you guys will </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like uh it's called the Northman okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> um I had never heard of it until Aki </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> told me about it because Aki's been on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this really weird binge of watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Viking films I don't know why okay uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe it's the fact that she loves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Assassin's Creed uh but like she but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so she recommended me this film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that came out like not that long ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like maybe a couple of months ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um like didn't do any numbers at the box </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> office or anything but I was interested </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to watch it because it's a Robert Eggers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> film and he's the same guy who made the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lighthouse yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and I was like okay well I like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actor and like the people and it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] star-studded like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cast like there was um uh Alex scars God </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> uh who's the guy who played uh Pennywise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and Bjork was in the film which I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> thought was interesting I was like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't even know you could act uh and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Willem Dafoe and like you know all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these like I like the lighthouse live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah so I watched it and uh it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the most [ __ ] over-the-top Epic film </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've ever seen in my it was like if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> took the concept of a Viking Revenge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> story and put it in a dark souls world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the the fights were just so like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been meaning to watch it yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know how like you know how like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Eggers uh type of like directing is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> very like art Housey yeah it's very hot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's very you know it's very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> non-conventional right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um which is probably why it flopped at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the box office but yeah apparently it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was a flop yeah unfortunately which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like crazy because it was such a good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one but like the the fights what I liked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about this film was that like I guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the guy who wrote the original </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> screenplay of it is like a poet so all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the dialogue is kind of written in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this like poetry of sorts so it's not so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not so much like uh you know I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna go you know avenge my my uncle who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> killed my father and you know know they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> will reap for their sins in the gates of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hell it was more like you know it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I will find the blade in the moon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of the knights and like Shakespearean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it was it was so like it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching a stage play yeah but with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these Vikings and it and like the some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the fight scenes were just like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most 300 us like fight scenes where it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just like so over the top so epic like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's one point where they're like two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Vikings completely butt naked a fighting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on like the top of a volcano and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> volcano is like erupting in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> background they just like slicing each </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other this is this is too insane this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> too epic that and and it made me realize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like why has no one heard of this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> film why is like no one watched this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> film because it's like it literally did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like like Dark Souls right like if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they made Dark Souls into a movie and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they put something like animals that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> watched it no no no it was uh it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> online I saw it online </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it came out last year actually oh oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meaning either so I watched it and I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just like God damn like because I still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> haven't seen the lighthouse right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> um but I've seen like little bits on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> White House yeah and I was like okay if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is the same guy made the lighthouse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm interested now yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but yeah it was it just made me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> realize I was like Vikings are [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I knew they were cool like watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> finland's songs yeah yeah but that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what I was saying yeah I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> halfway through this filming and I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> looked over at you I'm like you should </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably watch Vineland Saga because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this this the plot is basically Finland </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Saga right yeah it's actually not much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no she's never seen it I don't know and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like you're on the Viking like thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like go go watch the households like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do not watch anime </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> anime was washed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so um I just wanted to recommend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that film because uh I've literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> heard no one talking about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's so I watched a few new films </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the flyby from Thailand as well okay </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> yeah I had no idea yeah I just I [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> love Godzilla I haven't watched it but I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> knew that right because other people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> talk about it yeah because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially like king of monsters was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like fan fiction for like or like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fanservice fully Godzilla fans because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like like you had like Ghidorah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come out like my girl Mothra was there I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like let's go you're moving here </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> having </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and just you know having that one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> film especially in like the western </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> films uh and there's that be it I didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> realize that they had made a kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a ongoing storyline with all of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these monsters and then adding like King </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Kong into the mix and adding the King </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Kong movies uh honestly out of I had a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much better time than I thought I would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had considering I'm not that big of a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fan of like Godzilla which one was your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> favorite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably king of monsters yeah right uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like I don't know why that movie got so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> much [ __ ] because I'm like dude how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could you hate a bunches get [ __ ] get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] on I heard king of monsters wasn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well received in like the Godzilla </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fan base right or whatever or like just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the general movie going thing and I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like how could you hate a bunch of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> monsters beating the [ __ ] out of each </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other yeah it may be I think it just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like lit a certain part of my brains </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I just like oh giant things are fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah giant giant monsters that's cool it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like Smash Bros with Kaiju it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] honestly right because the whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gang is here I don't think anything's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tickled that part of my brain since like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the the original Pacific Rim oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I consider they always all kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bash your head together films yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it was literally just ungo Bunga films </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but in like entire cities yeah I gotta I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gotta say the MVPs uh whoever the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] construction workers are to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rebuild these cities every time a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> monster battle happens because oh my God </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in king of monsters every [ __ ] City </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gets destroyed my God is there a city </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> left on Earth that hasn't been decimated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by these monsters oh yeah there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another film art which Were King Kong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Godzilla go at it I'm like Carter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just you know conveniently or after like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that huge amount of Destruction then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah lost all the Architects survived </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> simulation it's got to be a simulated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> wall it's kind of like how else are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these towns appearing back so quick I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know man maybe they pull like an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Aver and like a new you know Town comes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> out from underground all right let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> replace it my favorite Godzilla though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is uh still Shin Godzilla have you seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Godzilla I've seen it I've never seen a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Godzilla film you've never seen a real </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Godzilla film just didn't look like my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cup of tea did you like Pacific Rim I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't watch Pacific Rim okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your cup of tea I think listen I know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm a simple brain individual at times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it doesn't mean it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there is literally a giant monkey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] flying around wrecking and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> buildings yeah you know and destroying a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> giant lizard the only kind of guide you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ask thing I've ever watched is the 2006 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> King Kong film whatever that remake was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh the one with Jack Black in it I just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> had a Jack Black yeah that one sucked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah oh yeah everyone that came out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> though everyone hyped that up to Dad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah as a kid I remember yeah why is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone talking about it okay I I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know if I would call it it's ironic but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if I would can call the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> original King Kong Kaiju that's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> never-ending argument okay maybe maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so many writer threads I've seen being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought it was because they always had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like King Kong versus Godzilla and [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um I feel like Clifford the bid ranked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Donna okay okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like I don't think the original King </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Kong films </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like their appeal to me is totally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> different because when you know when I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watch a King Kong film it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something different right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> actually really good analogy it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more like seeing Sonic and smash and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like he's like the American dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like King Kong he just got roped in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like I I know I like if you ask me and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you put a gun on my head if I I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> said it you know it's like the closest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of thing yeah I know I think King </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Kong became a Kaiju after he was kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> roped into the Godzilla like franchise </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah to me like Pacific Rim is still one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of my favorite turn your head off uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry turn your brain off and just enjoy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> visual cocaine because oh my God that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> film gets you so hot I I always wondered </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> uh on planes I was like I wonder if the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the airflow crew they like judge what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're watching if they see what you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching they're like that's [ __ ] dog </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] because I was watching like a Spyro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the dragon video and someone comes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> over to me she's like do you want </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> I'm like I will </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Spyro watching Spyro the Dragon videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like they must think I am a weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ass but I'm sitting in this business </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> seat next to all these serious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> businessmen watching Spyro the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Dragon reviews like they were thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like who is this guy why is he what is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he watching so I was also I was also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> judging the person in front of me for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what they were watching right we got on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the six hour flight and I shoot you not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this person was watching minions and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Minions movies the whole yeah and I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> always that guy and I was like who is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this guy because I was wondering what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of person would watch minions yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> business class I thought because because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had a couple of like uh like kids in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the the business cabin that we were in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right so I remember yeah it was the guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sitting right in front of me yeah I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like every time I looked over I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just to check you know maybe it's like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 15 year old kid or whatever I look it's </SPEAKER_02>
