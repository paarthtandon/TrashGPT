<SPEAKER_04> levels yeah i didn't i didn't feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i was sick when i woke up when i woke up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like wow it's just kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's kind of hot isn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it that's a little bit a little bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spicy it's kind of what a fever is you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> know well i didn't particularly feel bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i felt i've had fevers before where i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> felt really sick yeah i didn't feel good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but this one i was just like wow i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just really hot oh really wow and then i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got out of bed and i went to check my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> temperature and i was like oh it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's high yeah it's oh i'm i'm cooking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from the inside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and then i was like okay i'm gonna go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and get some uh energy drink from the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> store not that i'm not energy drink like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gatorade or whatever you know just yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> generic water so red bull is probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> literally just any drink that's water </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> featuring sugar uh yeah one of those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> drinks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and i got it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then by the time i got home i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like okay no i actually think i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> sick now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i think i feel pretty shitty yeah and so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't do anything it was the opposite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for me i immediately woke up and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all of my joints were just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> aching like crazy but it was weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i checked my temperature and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> only had like 37 or something so i only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had a slight fever but man my bones were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just rattled yeah it was really weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for me because i woke up and i felt like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> completely fine i woke up to like we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have like a group chat where like all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the staff members of trash taste were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like are we recording today and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone posted that temperature and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're like no we're definitely not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recording today no that's that's not a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing that's happening and then i took </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my temperature and mine was just like 37 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the door and i was like yeah i feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> completely fine and got up started doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> work be like ah these these guys just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have weak immune systems these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah things having weak immune systems </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and a [ __ ] like two o'clock rolls </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> over sitting on my computer i'm like oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm getting chills what's what's that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what's happening here what's happening </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right yeah yeah and then i went from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like being completely fine to just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> having the worst headache and just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably just having the flu so i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like man there's a vaccine he's got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hands man it's [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fighting this has been delayed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it was a bit late so like yeah in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the end i just i i woke up completely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fine and then for like most of the day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after 2 p.m i was just completely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> bedridden yeah yeah um how long were you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guys in bed for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know i was watching the olympics </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you know just chilling oh yeah just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> watching people do sports and i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> wow i still could be me right i still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> haven't seen anything from the olympics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> except the opening ceremony i saw that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because yeah we had like a like a little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> viewing party at our place yeah because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> uh one of our friends really wanted to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> see the opening for something to be fair </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's probably like the most interesting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> part of the olympics honestly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean if you're not into sport right i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel like you don't even need to be into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sport to be into the olympics oh no like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> story lines you know it's a story i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure but like i think for like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> majority of people who aren't into sport </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and don't care about the olympics the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> opening and ending ceremony probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the two biggest highlights of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the scene i guess i i don't really care </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> about sports in general i don't i just i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know why something about the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> olympics is fun it's a thing where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's just sport that's on all day and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's changing constantly between events </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so you don't have a chance to get bored </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like when i've been watching like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know i might be watching the cycling of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> too long i'm like all right okay but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then the next the boxing comes on and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say oh okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then and then you know it keeps </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> changing and then like okay and i like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the [ __ ] going on like what is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> actually right who's winning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean yeah for me the olympics is i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> never been really too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> interested in the olympics it's probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of my least favorite sporting events </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just because there's a bit too much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going on for me like at least no because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> we talked about least favorite sporting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> events yeah i mean i mean we talked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about stories we lost the olympics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what's worse than the olympics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every other sporting event </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know what's better than the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> olympia better than olympics well i like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> most major sporting events when they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when the league doesn't count </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> league doesn't dude league does count on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you i [ __ ] love the league fighter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> video games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what am i listening to i love the world </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> cup i love the euros i love the rugby </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> world cup as well it's just like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> for me it's easier to follow along the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> storyline if just there's just like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> event or one tournament going on right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with the olympics it's just like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> stage are we at what what sport is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know i've never even heard of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> what the [ __ ] is handball how do i get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> invested in handball when i don't even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> know the [ __ ] rules </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i totally agree with you and so i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could have watched it on japanese tv </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably is that i don't understand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fully what's being said all the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and i feel like i realized when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when watching on japanese tv i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wow actually like knowing who the people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are and why i should give a [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually really important oh yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thought just being able to leave it on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the background that'd be interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the whole point of commentators </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right so and i realized and i so i got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> my vpn and i watched it on the british </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> uh the british uh website did you use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> expressvpn i did use accessories hell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i i was watching with the british </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> commentary and the commentary was really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't realize how much it added to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's some commentary that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he'd be like actually dying like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> laughing like uh i think the british </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> rowing team didn't win like any gold </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> medals and one of the commentators just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> couldn't hold back he was so pissed off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he was like the absolute state of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> british rowing we invested 27 million </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> pounds in british rowing and we didn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get a single gold medal and it was just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like live on tv like right after they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> just lost and it's like he's just going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in he's like he's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i felt embarrassed i'm like imagine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you're the rose that made this guy on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bbc go off on one because i don't want a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tyrant </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> legendary this is like all the other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good sports i don't know anything about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like taekwondo i don't know anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> about but the commentators help explain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything as you're going and yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it is annoying when you're watching it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for too long because then they start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> over again and they start explaining it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> again because they assume that people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are only watching for short amounts of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time yeah they because nobody knows what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the hell the rules are yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> great i mean i was watching like diving </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> as well diving is really fun to watch oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah diving super fun it was really fun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think that's the only like sports that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i like in the olympics is like just the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obscure ones that you never get to see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> otherwise so it's like with like tennis </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and rugby it's like you know that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> playing all year rugby your [ __ ] in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> olympics have you seen it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like five minutes aside or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something and there's only like 10 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> minutes of rugby well most major sports </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that have like bigger competitions yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> are like pretty [ __ ] in the olympics i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel like like they send like the b team </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah they don't see you like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> look at like the football or the rugby </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or like the tennis yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> as well yeah oh there's baseball there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so yeah there's baseball yeah it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> basically more like basketball as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah like like sports that have like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> competition that's just more prestigious </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than the olympics for that specific </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> sport i feel like it just takes a bit of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the wind out the real magic of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> olympics is watching this small sport </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that you've never heard well yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because a lot of these sports don't have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> any major leagues to you know push them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and give them a lot of money in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously i did see a bit of like the uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the skateboarding because i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> interested in that i think japan got a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gold medal in it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's all kids as well yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 10 year old kids yeah i'm like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dude god imagine winning a [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right what was i doing in 10 years i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> realized the olympics this year has been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> awful like every single athlete right he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looks like 30 the interview he's like 21 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he's just won the gold medal i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like what the [ __ ] man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this man is built like a greek god and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he's won a medal and he's got he's got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> his [ __ ] together yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you you've reached that point where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i you reached that point when you were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when everyone in the olympics is younger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than me yeah no no not even the olympics </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> or when you grow when you when you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> young everyone you watch on tv is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> older than you yeah and it's just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something you get used to like every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every athlete every major like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> personality is just older than you and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> then you get to a point where you start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> seeing people that's younger than you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and achieving these amazing achieving </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> these amazing things and like starting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> football i'm like geez like at 21 i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] masturbating and eating cheetos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i mean well these kids just want a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] olympic gold medal yeah i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> getting really pissed off because every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> single time they introduce someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just younger than me i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the [ __ ] is this where's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where's the 30 year old get it pull it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> get him in what does he do he's he's the </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> old it's like jesus it's pissing me off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm like this is surely surely there has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to be someone age 24 that's why i kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of almost prefer the winter olympics a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of times because i feel that in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> winter olympics there's more of those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like more niche sports that you really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> only get to see in the olympics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> otherwise you really have to go deep for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it like curling for example is like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> never thought i would care about curling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> until i watched the curling like two </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> winter olympics back and i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> damn i want to try this this looks fun </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as [ __ ] because i didn't even know the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> rules to calling at first i was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just a bunch of people scrubbing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> some ice like all right cool so but then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you actually like learn the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> intricacies of the game it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all right that's actually like really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> cool i don't understand why like every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> country just doesn't agree to take like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a week off during the olympics well to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just sit down and watch it sit down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> chill watch it why not every every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> country can you know have a week off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> seems like the world economy might have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a different a small issue with that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean it's like once every what four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> years right yeah take a week off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean okay dude do you get patriotic at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> all during the olympics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i i listen to what the commentators tell </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me to do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the commentators tell me i should care </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> about something i'm like all right i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> caring do you get patriotic at all about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like any sporting event </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> oh yeah uh league of legends i want the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eu boys to win well i mean obviously i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> again anything else uh for me the world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> cup and the euros yeah i was i actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> stayed up i watched the euros and watch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> england get beaten this time yeah in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> finals once again good um </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was it was horrible i had to record </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trash taste like the day as well which </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is why i was until like four years </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> remember the last time i recorded trash </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this while i was absolutely dead yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> because i was like watching [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> england just int </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> over like whales in rugby i want wales </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to win right oh yeah and then if whales </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get knocked out of something and england </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are still in it it's like okay now i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> rooting for england to lose </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd think it would be like you'd think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mostly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> the problem is with english people is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that they're the worst when they win at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the sport they like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> every time they win it's like every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> single country hates them because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they're just they somehow are the worst </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> country at winning yeah they're like bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> losers yeah or bad winners well it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just like every single country hates </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> having the fans in their country </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because they're the worst yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> terrible </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like like people think because you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> welsh part of great britain well sean in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it you're gonna you've root for england </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and it's the complete [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> opposite now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> except if it's the other way around like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember when uh andy murray won </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> wimbledon it was like it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> britain's first win in wimbledon floyd </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> god knows how many years he's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] decades right um and it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the only time where like a british like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> english people are happy to cheer for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like scottish people because annie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> murray scottish i believe yeah um but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they aren't happy to share the other way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> around everyone hates english people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right that's true </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and normally english people won't cheer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for scottish people welsh people but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when it once is great britain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything's fine everyone's funny buddy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's buddy buddy again it's team </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> gb now which is really [ __ ] confusing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because depending on the sport is it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> totally up to the sport whether or not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a welsh scottish and english team </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> right or if it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh a british team or some i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's one or two sports where wales </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and england are combined but scotland </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't yeah so it's really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of cool whales scotland is just so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> confusing to someone outside of that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> country like i've had it explained to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about three or four times i believe by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you two and i still don't understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> what it is not that complicated i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so what's considered uk what's great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> britain what's the commonwealth what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all this [ __ ] like it's it's just really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> confusing to me i mean we do we want to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have we do we the siege watch cbc great </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> video yeah there's there's plenty of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> people just trying to explain it there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> plenty of videos on it we're not going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to explain it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you should learn that wales exists </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and see but at least like you know in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the case with like wales in england </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right like at least you got you know i i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel a lot of the same sports you guys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> are either good at or bad at right so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like say for example like in the rugby </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> right whales in england pretty good yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah they're not like top top but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're you know usually stay up near </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the top right so like at least you have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that choice yeah i don't have that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> choice with my two countries because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sports that australia is good at japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> sucks at sports that japan is good at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> australia sucks at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so like in the soccer right like japan's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty good australia's [ __ ] in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cricket japan didn't don't even play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cricket </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the same like the rugby is probably like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the only thing because you know i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> last rugby woke up japan came like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eighth i think yeah top eight or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something it was hosted in japan yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is hype as far as right because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan is never that good um that was the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> only time where i was like all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan you did good but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're gonna have to go back to syria now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> after that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's australia they're gonna rugby </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah australia's really good and they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in top four yeah i don't watch sports </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> often mainly because of a it's just you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know we're supposed to live in this time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> zone what the [ __ ] when the [ __ ] is this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] happening the reason why it's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> easy to keep along with the olympics is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's just all day yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> great i wake up it's on i go to bed it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean that's kind of what i liked about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> big sporting competitions you know any </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> any age i was where you turn on the tv </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's just sports playing and it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just it's just fun and it's fun to watch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something where every match matters to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> somebody i just wish i knew more about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who was competing yeah in the olympics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> no way you can though yeah there's no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> way there's so much information and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you know even like i was getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> confused because even in like some of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the sports like taekwondo or some of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> martial arts it's like weight divisions </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and there's so many weight divisions </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's so many competitors in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> weight divisions and there might be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> multiple ones from your country in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one weight division so it's really hard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like all right wait who am i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> rooting for what the [ __ ] is going on i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just see the flag and i'm like oh i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> recognize that one go that one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's basically what it boils down to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right it's just like i like my country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> let's see that country do well yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh i've never heard of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> liechtenstein before i i think they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good at this sport </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they compete in the olympics i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even know there's a lot dude like okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> watching the opening ceremony and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know how they have to like go through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the countries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like over 100 countries that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were competing this year but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was funny because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they were going not in alphabetical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> order yeah they were going in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese like hiragana order which is oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> completely different i was wondering </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what kind of order they were going in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah they just seemed like the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> weird order yeah that had never been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> done that's why there were like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> some countries starting with c that came </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after countries starting with k because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in japanese alphabet it's like in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same order so like i remember my sister </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in australia was texting me because she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was watching it as well and she was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh it's really funny because these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> australian commentators have been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> explaining for the past 10 minutes why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> these countries are coming out in this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> order they literally have to explain the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> japanese writing system to an australian </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] audience to be like oh so okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so hear me out this is how it works and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is why it's the weird order but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like i heard dude there were so many </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> countries in there where i was like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that sounds like a made-up word like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's not a real country some of them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> aren't i i i'm correct aren't even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> countries like uh i think like some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them are like micro nations yeah some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the more uh territories territories are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> other countries like there's the cayman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> islands as well as listed as this yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't think that is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i saw some drama happen live while i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> watching boxing there was like a british </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guy versus a french guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i mean that's drama already yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's trump already which is that's i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> mean let's go back to history </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> napoleon just makes a [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> exposed video or whatever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it was literally like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were boxing right and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so obviously when you're boxing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes you like you did they do the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hugging thing yeah and it's like okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cool so when they were doing the hugging </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thing like i think the french guy was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like head-butting the british guy oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] he like made him bleed and the ref </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was like hey don't do that again he did </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then he just immediately </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> disqualified him right right the french </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> guy yeah yeah and he had a [ __ ] men </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down like a mental breakdown and started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like shouting and stuff going up to all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the cameras being like no i won no i won </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into the wow and they were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> announcing it and he was like no stop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> announcing it stop it now stop the count </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah he was like stop this is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no way and he was like throwing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a massive fit it was so crazy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how did i not see that i don't know i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when i when it was happening i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh [ __ ] am i watching drama live yo [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i went to i didn't want any good uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> personality </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was great the live league thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> started popping up like midway it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i immediately went to twitter as any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good person would when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> featuring drama i was like oh this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> great i went to twitter and i watched it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i was just watching everyone else </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> talk about the drama i was watching oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's weird because i've seen so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clips of the olympics there's a lot more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> drama in the olympics it happens yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think i've watched more olympics on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> twitter than i have on television the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> only clips i saw at the olympics was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they're playing a lot of anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> music yeah a lot of people are doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> anime stuff yeah so when you come out in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> boxing you're allowed to play your own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> music yeah yeah yeah yeah and some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them one of them the demon slayer one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the japanese guys yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i saw there was a greek person who did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i did like year two in one piece </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and won the [ __ ] one uh gold medal as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> well what a bad i think he said a record </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as well so i'm just like yo one piece </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> stands founder of one piece stands like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] stand up yeah the i think one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the volleyball matches with the japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> team they'll play in the haikyuu theme </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like during like the intervals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm like that's so cool but yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the opening set the only cool part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about the opening ceremony was the fact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that that from what i saw because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> admittedly like compared to some of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> other opening ceremonies that i've seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was a very artistic one i'd say yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [Applause] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what that means it was history </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was very bare bones it was bare bones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the references i think that people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were looking for were not in the opening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so i think a lot of people are hoping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that it comes out in the ending ceremony </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but i think the only cool thing was that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> during the time when all of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> countries were coming out because that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a like an hour and a half segment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of like all the countries coming yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they were playing like just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> basically the entire discography of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> square enix games like literally every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> square enix game you could think of they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were playing the musical so like they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally opened with like the dragon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> quest theme and like they're playing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> final fantasy chrono trigger like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] near they've played a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> near automatic yeah i heard them but not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just any near automata song literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> the most darkest depressing mirror </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that plays in like a really sad scene in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the game oh my god i mean it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> malta and it's just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really weird but like i'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking like because you know i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the biggest question everyone had who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watched the opening is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where's all the nintendo [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what i was pokemon where's mario </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where's all that stuff that they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> promised that like it's kind of odd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because normally japan has been quite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> patriotic with all of its especially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> pokemon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> japan is not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as sweet what's the word uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> japan has not been scared to embrace </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> pokemon right national symbol and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know considering the fact that at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the end of the last olympics yeah the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> mario thing yeah like a prime minister </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> came out of a pipe dressed as mario </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right it could be a thing if nintendo </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't want to do it or it could have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> been a thing of or i think what a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people are waiting for is because they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> were like square enix we'll let you take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the opening </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but nintendo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> is the end i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's why by the time this has come out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll know the answer yeah i guess so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like that's as of right now that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what i think all the theories are yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean like do you think the opening was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> purposefully done the way it is or is it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> just because of the world situation that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> they couldn't make it bigger because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what i i think i think it's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> latter did you go back and watch other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> opening ceremonies i did yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the beijing olympics like that one was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> insane compared to like japanese i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the japanese one was good don't get me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wrong but i definitely did feel that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think the world situation really did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> screw it over in a lot of ways yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i like the idea that they were going for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i feel it was like a little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> underperformed it's like where's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> budget yeah right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it really did feel like that won't have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the [ __ ] queens yeah yeah yeah i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like how much did that cost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah that daniel craig be james bond </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no way he did that for less than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 50 million exactly he literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> hates james bond </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> as we've established why would he want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to do that exactly right for queen and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> country obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that like you know they would have at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> least you know some more like notable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like big big people coming out in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> opening right because like that's you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> know the way to like open for your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> country and like be braggadocios about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> your country for years but i feel that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like that's the one time you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> actually brag yeah right and like people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> are waiting for you to brag but like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like the references that they did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> throw in were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> super [ __ ] subtle and like kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> offhand or like what was that guy that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was tap dancing i didn't get that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> he was literally okay yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he was literally i think it was he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the greatest tap dancer in japan wait to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> explain what was going on i watched him </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't remember that so there was this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tap so what they did instead was instead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of bringing out these like notable names </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they brought out like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan's best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> blank so like they had like japan's best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tap dancer and he was performing and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like they had japan's best like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> jazz pianist yeah i do remember this and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i i think i was like why are they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bringing in tap dances in japan yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> also during a really like traditional </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like wood scene yeah that's why i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like 400 years of difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between tap dancing and like edo period </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when i think japan i don't think tap </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't think tap dancing in jazz </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> piano it was just so surreal seeing like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a tap dancer dancing on a stage with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing on it to a crowd of zero people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a stadium that's meant for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> thirty thousand yeah yeah yeah oh it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so depressing seeing all the studios </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i actually read that uh they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the guy who designed like the the actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> stadium </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he to make you know because obviously </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they couldn't put people into the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stadium so what they did was he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> purposely designed the seats and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> arranged the colors to make it look like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> there were people sitting from a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> distance what how can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you [ __ ] didn't that was the intent i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> think yeah but uh yeah obviously you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> know to varying degrees of success i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mean i think a lot of it was unfortunate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i i think another thing about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the tap dancing is that it's because the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stadium was so big and i don't think the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> microphones were sensitive enough i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> could hardly [ __ ] hear it it was at </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that point it was just like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stepping with attitude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that's that's kind of what it felt like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the commentators even in the i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching on japanese tv they were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> explaining what was going on more than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they were letting their audio play yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how good of an opening ceremony is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> if i need i actually need a narrator to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tell me what's happening like legit some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of the stuff was so avant-garde yeah it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was crazy but like sixty percent of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> commentators were like doing [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like audio commentary yeah they were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> telling the description exactly what was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> this represents blah blah blah and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like just let me watch it shut up just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> let me watch it's not very good if i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't discern what's going on right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly yeah i was watching it through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the british commentary and there wasn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> actually much commentary because i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were just as confused </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not a good opening ceremony if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] talk over all of it yeah exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't go and watch of mice and men and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> have someone narrow in my ear what's why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why lenny is doing all this [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know what i mean i don't need this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> let it speak for itself that's it's oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> my god i think i think the speech </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> afterwards of like the olympic committee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> actually went on for longer than the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> performance yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> zoned out yeah yeah so yeah i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like maybe that was because of a budget </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> problem it was because of the world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> situation but i mean like i think a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more people i think the only good thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that came out of it was probably square </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enix's stocks went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because of like the amount of music they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> used at the beginning i wanted to know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how square enix was basically just got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> over to got to like take over the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> opening ceremony yeah i've noticed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> there's so many other like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese yeah honestly but they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally like you know had the actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> spotlight at that point like i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well like it wasn't just square enix </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> music they literally played a song from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] sonic adventure 2. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are you serious there was yeah one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the songs that played in the scene </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the set piece uh like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was leaked on twitter before the actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like beginning of that segment and in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the list there was a [ __ ] sonic song </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> rolling around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i think there's that one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the best opening ceremony of all time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but yeah they literally i don't think it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was sonic adventure 2 it was one of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> sonic games but they legitimately played </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a sonic song and i'm just like i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> sean's pretty [ __ ] iconic i mean hey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> man like they did it i guess how did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sega get in and then nintendo just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't then i and i think that's why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that's where the confusion arose of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like okay so like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously more people know when you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> think of japan from like a foreigner's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> perspective you think pokemon and mario </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah like you don't think of final </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fantasy and sonic would you say song is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> more famous than final fantasy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is right sonic yeah probably probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not weird because he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> only had like three good games yeah he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally just like he's coming on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bridge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah he's literally cashing in on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> brand recognition he he is sonic is one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of those sonic riders though okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i recognize that it's not the best game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> sonic riders battle adventure 2 is good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and sonic heroes was weirdly good too </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but but isn't it strange though how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> sonic hasn't had like the biggest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> smash hit games yet he's still like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one of the most recognizable that's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> thing sonic is not purely surviving off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of character design brand recognition </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like he's he's just an icon his </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> character design is poor [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's brilliant </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just the cult following all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like you know after sonic uh the uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> sonic 3 all right like we haven't had a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> single like goose </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> well i mean yeah but i mean it's kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a remake of it yeah yeah that's up for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> debate i mean it's all like been 2d </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sonics there hasn't been a good 3d sonic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> all the 2d sonics were fantastic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the 3d sonics except for writers was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know absolutely trash and yet they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can somehow pump out all these sonic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] sonic games and people are still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean the next one might be if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> don't play mario and sonic at the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> olympic games no i haven't i [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lost oh </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> i don't care if you were raised in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] magma crust of this earth i know </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_02> doing this or how how is like anyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meant to compete in this weather i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> wonder why i'm pretty sure i read </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> something i could be totally totally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wrong on this one that apparently they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did try and ask uh japan did try and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> tell them like hey we should do it in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like september or something yeah the ioc </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> was like nope no we're doing it in july </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and of all the sports that are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> perfect for this heat aka the swimming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is done indoors yeah so it's like no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least do that outside you know feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> good for the athletes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah jesus i feel i feel bad now i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> didn't even think about that they must </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> be absolutely dying out there in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> heat dude it's brutal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah but like i mean how how how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> much is left of the olympics now that we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are i don't know not only what days left </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> where are we because it's been like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> only like a two-week event isn't that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah we're on like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what yeah yeah [ __ ] or like day 12 or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> something i thought it was like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought it was like a couple of months </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> no it has to be done it's like i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the rules in the contract with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the olympics committed to the local </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> government is that it needs to be done </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> within like two weeks oh wow and no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> longer no less like it has to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> why does it feel like every olympics it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lasts so much longer than that i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's just so stacked because you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> get so like the hype for it is built up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> more than any e3 event tenfold yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah any gay any no man's sky wishes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that it had this much hype like because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everything in in like you know i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we've lived in japan for like two years </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> now right and since day one since you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> been here you've been seeing tokyo 2020 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff everywhere like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's insane like everything is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> tokyo 2020 like you can get a chocolate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bar tokyo 2020s on it for some reason i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know why why is this on there we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did actually buy uh some tokyo 2020 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> merchandise just because like oh think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> about it right like it's one of the few </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if not the only olympics that has ever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> had you know been in this like weird </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> world situation where it's been delayed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> by you yeah right and it's like it's so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like telling of itself like i think aki </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bought a tokyo 2020 face mask like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> 50 years from now is going to be a great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> story to tell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like you know just to say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like yeah we lived through a time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where there was such like an insane wall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> pandemic that we literally had to a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cancelled the olympics for a year but b </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone had to [ __ ] wear this for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> two years i mean it's it's weird right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i feel like this olympics the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hype just like you talked about the hype </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i just haven't felt the hype at all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because i think i think last year </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> before covert hit it was the hype was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely oh yeah oh yeah yeah it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely but like i think the moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> covered hit and it got pushed back a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> year is when and then the hype for cove </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> had happened yeah and then i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty much the german people just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> turned against the olympics and they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> were like we don't want it anymore yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> even though japan is doing exceedingly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> well this olympics as well it's great </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's good oh yeah they've won a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> gold gold medals already yeah they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> third right now i think oh [ __ ] okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah they're doing very well see i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> haven't been following them along as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> much as i used to just because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't know just it like the high like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i said the hype just doesn't feel there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously in japan because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no japanese people don't want it to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> happen for obvious reasons yeah but also </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like internationally it just feels like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's been a lot less </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talk about it as well you see like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> odd article you see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's been a rough year i think i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah also like political situations are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> getting rough and you're seeing it in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the olympics as well yeah it's been it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been in a lot of talks just not for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right reasons yeah it just feels like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know at least like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> olympics pre i don't know like 2012 2016 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe not 2016. i don't know didn't feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as like [ __ ] like politically as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i think there's a lot of politics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> in it now and that always was maybe i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> was younger and i didn't realize but it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> just yeah it feels uh very tense </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah i mean the world is you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in a tense state right now in general so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it definitely just doesn't help </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's just on edge now yeah i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's it's you know everyone loves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the idea of the olympics just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the every nation gets together and we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just play a bunch of sports differences </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah put our differences to size and uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> play some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> games friendly competitions um and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know in any other olympics i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is the case in this olympics it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just feels like nobody really like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's just forgotten to care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because everyone's just like can we just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have the world open back up yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i see the empty seats there it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> reminding me that it's still a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> depressing situation in the world well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> most of the world at least so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know it's it's it's it's been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> difficult yeah definitely definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just wanted to be how has how has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who has been winning the olympics i have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> not been keeping </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> china's winning right now five well it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> always china and usa at the top right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah and then japan and then i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> think australia and britain are like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> neck and neck yeah like fourth but i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it's hard to tell what's going to happen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but i mean china and usa normally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> always win yeah they're usually the type </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and then that's like the the cold </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> war-esque thing for them where it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> matters who wins that yeah that's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> friendly competition unless </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah what's the problem yeah what's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ranking so people should probably have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 30 goals okay uh united states of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> america 25 volts yeah okay japan number </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three with 20 volts nice oh wow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> australia 15 volts let's go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh roc republic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's right oh that's that's russia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's russia roc is fifth grade region </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> six oh okay okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yes britain isn't doing too well this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> olympics well i like that commentator </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> said man absolute embarrassment for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> british foreign absolutely absolutely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was one of the events that britain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> used to win at least somewhat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> consistently yeah yeah i mean it's i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like it's it's it's part of british </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> culture what are we calling sports </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's like one of the things where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> we're like we actually have like a big </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> deal about yeah it's like rowing and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cycling right that we usually cycling we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> normally have a really good tournament </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah british people love [ __ ] cycling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> meme where it was like britain invented </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sport gives it to other country they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> become better and then america's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> invent a sport no one plays it become </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> yeah they literally based league uh from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like american sports like the super bowl </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> what about because that's like the final </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right i don't know why it's called the </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> it's just one of the playoffs that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> sounds good i understand the playoffs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the playoffs make sense maybe it has to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> do maybe it has to do with the playoffs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lead to the super bowl so the super bowl </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the name for the final match yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah british man learns about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> american football man i don't know this </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> because i follow league and league is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> based on like american football i think </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> actual like cup you win do you watch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> american football oh yeah no that's not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a baltimore i don't know maybe it is i </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> are called the ashes right right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i know more about like the american </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sports system than dude i do i do about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> cricket so do you watch american </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> football </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i i just i watch the super bowl </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and anytime i go to america they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always watching football every week and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i pretend to care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about it i watch the football in america </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it's on tv i don't like willingly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go watch it but when it's on i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> okay that's pretty cool watching like uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> normal uh football uh you know you get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the ads just in the half time yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's when you get the ads yeah no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> other ads the 40 minutes is straight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> playing yeah so it's really weird and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> jarring when i watched american football </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and every time there's like an attempt i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think there's an ad and i was like whoa </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because there's so many starts and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff yeah yeah this is stops and of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> course they put ads there but it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so jarring i'm like [ __ ] i don't want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to hear about [ __ ] cheetos and bud </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> light man i just i can't do this like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's literally the two forces </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that drive the nfl it was hard to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> invested because every every 10 seconds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there'd be an ad and i was like oh my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> god i mean it's just everything is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> monetized yeah and also american sports </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so watching american tv in american </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> hotels is really weird as well because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know we have our ads before the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> program starts yeah and in the middle of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the program yeah right and when i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watching american tv i don't know if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they changed it or what but i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> watching it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they let the show play for like two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> minutes and then they have an ad and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> then they have an app yeah and i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what is this what is this youtube video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what is this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what the [ __ ] is this it's more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> consistent than a mid-roll it is they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they put like two mid-rolls and two end </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rolls because they have they have like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the intro they have like the clickbait </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> intro yeah uh then they have they have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> an ad and then the actual intro to the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> show plays uh half the show plays uh ad </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> second half of the show plays and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they have an ad and then you know that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's like an end credit scene or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something like that or i've seen the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> plays during the credits so they haven't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> had and then an end credit scene and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then it goes on to the next show or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes it's even worse it's sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's the end the end credits start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> rolling that minimizes into a corner and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shows an ad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah there's like another one that i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> seen i'm like am i am i watching an end </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> credit or i'm all watching it i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> watching south park and they played </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> legitimately like the first two minutes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of the actual episode and then they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> played an ad </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right and then they played like 20 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> minutes of the episode nearly near the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> end right before the end the other ad </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah right before the end like i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> a minute or two before the show finishes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah and for concludes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they play an ad and then they play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the the two minutes of the episode and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then they don't have a break or anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they immediately start the next episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of south park yeah oh right two minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of that play and then they play an ad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> again yeah right right and so it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's i was losing my mind i was all in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the wrong i was actually getting so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> angry watching south park because i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like why do they keep putting the ads </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this it feels like i'm being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> bombarded i can't think or straight </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where is the the clear act of we put an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ad in the middle and before the show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah when did this go out the window i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean it's it's because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> viewers are more likely to keep watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the show right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i know why it is i hate it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i hate it from like an entertainment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> standpoint to be like just let me watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> clear chunk of this one episode have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> clear moment where you know the episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ends and the next one begins and that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where the ad break goes yeah they don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> give you a chance to take a pee break in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between an episode yeah because they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh you might change the channel so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll just play it immediately first two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> minutes now you can go where did this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> change when was it like this i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's always been like this in america </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has it really yeah i have no idea i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> ever since every like the first time i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> went to america it was like this and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember that was one of the first thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i noticed as well but then you look at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> how because normally like when you binge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watch american tv shows there's like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> very clear cut of where they put the ads </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in and it's just like a weird moment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to british tv shows which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just beginning halfway through the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episode than ending yeah we have really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> strict rules on advertising and stuff so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> there's never any overlays or anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> on the t on the program meanwhile </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese tv is like put as many ads in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> as you possibly can every five years </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so weird the stuff they promote in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> japan but then then you remember it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for elderly people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> other people only watch tv so then it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> all kind of makes sense like they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> advertise like futons all the time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> futons yeah the hell kind of shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're watching just normal like nhk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they'll just cut to a futon and there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so many uh tele telecall shows oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> telemarketing shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like this entire channel there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like three marketing shows there's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three or four channels basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's literally just it's literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whole yeah whole networks and they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not like way back they're like four or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> five yeah on the the remote and it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> just like a whole network dedicated to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ads and they show you the product then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you can call up yeah it's literally like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh it's like qvc or imagine if qvc was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> number five </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> qvc is number 20 in the uk or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right like way way down as it should be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just ads no one wants to watch that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just think of like if the shamwow guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just constantly promoting different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> types of shamwow for 24 hours so it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just an infomercial channel literally an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> information there's like three of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're like like the top the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> first 10 shows or something yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i could be chatting on my ass honestly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a lot of them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i can kind of see why there would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be so many infomercial kind of channels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i don't know like old people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> don't use the internet to buy things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah they don't know what it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so when you when you're a kid right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you had a sick day okay so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember i remember i remember as a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you know you'd enjoy the fact that you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> had a sick day because great i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have to go to school but what do you do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so back when i was a kid i did had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> nothing but just had television right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah so you had the morning tv shows </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you had cbbc when i was growing up and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then it was like it was like between </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 8 a.m to i think around 10 a.m which was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like brilliant i'm sick i get to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watch tv programs for as long as i stay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> home and then 10 a.m hits and then there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> is just nothing to [ __ ] watch like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there is nothing on tv at all and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember i'd just be like great i guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i'll just [ __ ] put on kvc then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because there's literally like nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> else interesting like jeremy kyle back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> then you could watch i didn't get jerry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> michael i was like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> seven-year-old i loved it i loved the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shouting and stuff and all the people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> jumping around i loved it yeah well i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think it's because like during like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> weekdays at you know in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the middle of the day yeah the only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people who are watching tv is like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> anywhere below eight and anywhere above </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 80 right because everyone else is at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> work or school yeah cause like if i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't watch something entertaining at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> least like watch some like shiny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> products that was that's how like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> brain worked right you're like oh if i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> can't watch something i mean it'll be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> advertised too yeah yeah i may as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> mom we have to get this diamond necklace </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> extra days free shipping it's like all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right this is this is just ridiculous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they keep throwing things in like and if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> you pay by card we'll come to your house </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and install it for you yeah it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> whoa whoa whoa and then and then and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> then the program will end and then you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can tell they've done this because they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did it all the [ __ ] time they would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> record an extra bit after it it clearly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> didn't sell well enough whatever yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it would cut you another pit and it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would be like but but [ __ ] that part if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you buy now you'll get five instead of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three only for today yeah it's like what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is good what's going on i'm always </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> losing my [ __ ] money literally just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like keep adding on [ __ ] and it's always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like it needs to be now that you call it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like before the next thing comes in you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> need to so like there's people probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just like sitting there just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> waiting to call it like there's another </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> half the time can i call it now because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was sold before and now now they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just raising my concerns because this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now too much this is just like too good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be true yeah now it's too much this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is way too many products yeah yeah i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sold on the 50 pan and now you tell me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you're going to include three pens no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> way this is a cast iron yeah it should </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> not be costing ten dollars per pen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> including shipping this is rejected </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what what's what like set me off was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they would introduce like when they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> would include a product that had like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nothing to do with the product that they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were advertising yeah but they just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> tacked it on for free yeah like where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> did this come from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you get the jewelry and now we're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> throwing in an extra tenga on top like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> this is totally unrelated </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> all this is worth three hundred dollars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but we're selling it for thirty dollars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like is it really really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no way all of these companies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are making money yeah exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm pretty sure i saw this thing that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're tacking on yesterday's commercial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so it clearly didn't sell well you had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a golden age because like i felt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like there was a time when the products </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> were actually semi-decent yeah like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you'd go to the supermarket you'd </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> actually see the section of yeah as seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on tv products and there were some of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> them actually like pretty good well i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> mean like look how much the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shamwell sold right like that started i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> think it was just before the internet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> was invented so like now you can just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> search up whatever product you kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> need and if not then japan has a whole </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> store for them it's called [ __ ] daiso </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so like you just walk into daiso </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you just you you you find </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> products that you never knew you needed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> until you walked into this i need a sign </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now that just says as seen on dice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like japan is just like the king of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> creating these little devices which have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like exactly one use one very very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> specific use that you never thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about until you see it in the store and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like wow i guess i guess i do need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like gloves that can like clean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dishes at the same time i like what i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a lot of stuff i guess i do need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> slippers that have like mops on them so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that i can like walk around while </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> mopping the house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i guess that's a thing it's only 200 yen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] it i'll take it yeah why not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> meanwhile if i saw that on tv i'll be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like who the [ __ ] is this yeah he's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who needs some slippers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they also like it's like a 100 yen store </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> so like less than a dollar even like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's around a dollar but your standard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like my favorite thing is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes in daiso they'll have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the same product but different brands </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're all the same price i'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like what is this like why if you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna if you're gonna have your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> competitor right next to you for the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> same price and i what i think is the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> same quality what is the purpose of this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> well there's clearly not much kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> tradition </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there's completely there's obviously not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like dragon's den would never work for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan because you get the ceo of daiso </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there and he'll just say yes to every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's gonna he'll be like i'll put in an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> offer i'm putting in an offer just opens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> his mouth i'm sold i don't even wanna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hear it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or putting it in my store </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i could imagine dragon said in the uk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they would they they have like 10 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] minutes introducing each other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before they even actually start the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] pitch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> business cards </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the person pitching would have to go and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] pour in water and everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's like they can't even start and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my god </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> jesus they'd have to start with like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> board meeting or something before they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> could even get in the room could you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> imagine they they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> people being pitched would be like no we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know exactly what's happening i want to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> see the script of the man pitching </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> before he pitches it you know it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> insane </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> i would love to see it actually but what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i never understood about those shows is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's it's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's sold as you know it's these are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very real businesses and very real ideas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that some of them actually going to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> successful and stuff right but like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you look at some of the people going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're just like okay i've watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dragons then before or like shark tank </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is the american version right it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's there's like a very simple </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> formula there's like very specific </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> questions that all the dragons ask every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> single [ __ ] time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and somehow 90 of the contestants never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know their [ __ ] numbers like i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> surely that's the first thing you do if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you if you figure out you're going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> dragons denver you're like all right let </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> me just figure out my [ __ ] profit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> margins yeah that's literally the first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing you should do yeah like what's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> your gross like sorry about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not gross thank you very much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like they're asking like what is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your target audience or whatever maybe i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people with money i saw this water clear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it may be [ __ ] laughing from the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> british one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's from the guy who's like the worst </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> he's like so what is he called is he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> called tuka tuka </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sounds like a breaking bad character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah right he's like he's like the guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who like all the other dragons hate on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the swamp and uh it's just a great </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> moment he is he's pitching the offer to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> them he's like okay so i'm gonna give </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you the fifty thousand pounds you asked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for i've seen this for for ninety </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> percent of the business what and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the dragons were like so all of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> business so you said you're trying to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> buy the business off of him </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like what's the remaining ten percent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't do anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember so so like the first thing he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was pitching to was like sweat you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're so who are you giving the money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to and he's like i'm giving the money to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the business and he was like but you own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 90 percent of the business </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so you're giving the money to yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it was so good and all the other dragons </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are like what the [ __ ] bro </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what the [ __ ] is this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> ultimate money laundering </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but imagine if you got to accept like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> sharp dragons shut up this genie is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going to agree to it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what is this like these supposed to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be professional like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> half these sometimes you see the dragons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're not a [ __ ] good businessman </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just got really [ __ ] lucky with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one business and managed to convince </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> this [ __ ] tv show to let you off yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> some of them have no [ __ ] idea what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they're doing i swear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they'll be like they'll be like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he's got a multi-million dollar business </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then when you think about businesses </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> multi-million dollar business is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actually not that difficult no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's yeah because it's it's it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> stark the contrast between like shark </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tank and dragon's den dragon like shark </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> tank have like mark cuban and like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> full-on like [ __ ] billionaires really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> really really you really like really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> really stupid people yeah super super </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] wealthy and then compared to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the dragons it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's i think half the dragons are like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> pretty successful but they they've had </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> trouble like keeping the seats filled </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right and they always bring in people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and a lot of the time they've had like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> businesses they just sold and made like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> four million which is obviously a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ton of money nothing me wrong but we're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> talking businesses you know it's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> really a good in the business well four </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> million yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i wouldn't say it's a hardcore proven </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> track record that you know how to run a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> business hundred percent you know what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right you might have got lucky here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there you had a good idea it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it doesn't prove that you i don't think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's good enough where you can go on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and start telling people how to run </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their businesses you know what i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like personally yeah i get it i guess i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i was just kind of like all right okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all right they'd introduce them maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like he made two million dollars off of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> his online card business and i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what what is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what that's never even heard of it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hardly a business </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> oh how am i kidding i'm insulting them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> two million dollars </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> child's play i don't know i just when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you when you you know we're talking a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lot of businesses here that's that's not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not that much in business well yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in the business world it's not that much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah yeah in layman's terms it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well yeah i think that's how the show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> works is that so most people watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the show in the uk obviously a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> million pounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two million pounds that's [ __ ] insane </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah most people can't comprehend that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but you know when you work with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> some businesses and stuff and you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> understand the margins they're working </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with that's not that much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but i guess it doesn't matter it's tv at </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the end of the day they're not actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> trying to like it's not actually trying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to give good business but it's like a </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_02> about mothers not true but you do give a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] about pokemon yeah but there's uh i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know if you've heard but uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> there's about 100 other pokemon games </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> out there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> that i could also play </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> but uh yeah i don't know like i saw like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> a piece of news on twitter i don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how true this is but uh like i think it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> day two or day three that pokemon unite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> came out and the league players were </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like oh ho what's this and then they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> invaded it and now apparently it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> full of uh it's either you're versing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> children who are eight years old or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're versing league players </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like that sounds like a terrible place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it just sounds like league 2.0 yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like no i like you pokemon but no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> thank you yeah the games are either very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fun or not fun at all right you either </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> get like stomped or you don't as a as a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gamer and a moba player how did you find </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it as a toxic gamer how do you feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> toxic playing games yeah as you talk to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> gamer i i enjoyed it i didn't like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fact that i couldn't racially slow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> within 10 seconds of getting in the game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh obviously that was very unfortunate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of course yeah there's no chat feature </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's actually voice chat apparently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is there apparently i don't know how you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> could you have to get you have to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have to hook up the mic through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> nintendo's like [ __ ] way of doing it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah i saw a voice chat option on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the game oh yeah no i have done that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through animal crossing actually oh and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it does not work so there is a chance </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that if you're a league player you could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> say something horrible to that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> ten-year-old kid right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no i'm kidding obviously but i mean uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's it's it's fine it's weird it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it it's it's pokemon but it definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> feels like it's been developed not by </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nintendo right like you can so has it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> been developed by nintendo no it's by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tencent oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of course of course of course it has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i guess a monopoly on mobas yeah um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's like it's weird man it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like when you haven't seen that family </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> member in like 10 years and he comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> back and he's really weird and he's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i'm the same guy right you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> no no what is this you're not the same </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> person you're right right it's like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> know you you boot it up there's there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> gacha there's loot boxes oh that's you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> can buy gems it's like oh my god this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't pokemon what is this nintendo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> micro transaction </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah nintendo's been real comfortable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with those micro transactions lately </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> been getting real comfortable with those </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> loot boxes all right okay yeah i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i haven't played pokemon unite but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've seen like clips looked into it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it just it it's so weird where did this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come from was this announced a while ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like the the whole idea of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a pokemon moba is just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how how did this happen when i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> pokemon i don't think league of legends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dota well i mean pokemon well people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought of that about pokemon when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] pokken came out right like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> people are like wait what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pokemon yeah which is a great game now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right but i remember when it was first </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> announced people were like this looks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> horrible this this just i thought it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> looked epic when it came out no i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> thought it looked epic but i saw a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of people who are like that doesn't work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know there's just something sad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there's something sad about seeing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> a child's game by nintendo like this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just shoved full of these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> egregious microtransactions yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> sure but i mean you know it's whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you can have a different opinion on it i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> don't really give a [ __ ] i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so have you pulled for the gotcha yet uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah techtone i played with a friend of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> ours and he was like he was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's a he is a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whale that is pretty much his job yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and with without love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah within five minutes he was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spend a hundred bucks just spend a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hundred bucks just get everything just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> unlock everything he's like and i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no i'm not gonna do that and he's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'll give you a hundred bucks just spend </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it right now and i was like what the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this man when it comes to gotcha this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man like loses all sense of money yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> he has no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> he has no way of holding back but i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> respect it you know oh yeah of course </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but i i just didn't want it because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could tell that i i i ended up spending </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like 40 bucks on it and i was like i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not going to play this again but i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to do it so i can play ranked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right is it free to play yeah okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> there's there's an excuse it can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you said you spent 40 bucks which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like free to play is the road to losing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> items you can buy that'll uh boost your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> stats in-game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so you can actually it's not it's kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of like the way to win </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the way it was explained to me and i the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way i understand it is that you know how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like league of legends used to have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing called runes yeah that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weren't pay to win they would give you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an edge but you could unlock them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through the game yeah but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they give you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a noticeable advantage i'd say at times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um but would you like back in the days </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you to buy runes remember yeah would you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have described ruins as pay to win back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then it's kind of like that i mean it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the advantages that roon runes gave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back in the day you wouldn't be able to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> take advantage of that small stat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> increase unless you unless you're at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the [ __ ] higher tier it's kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of like he's truly optimized the games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just came out and no one no one's been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had the time to underground to get this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stuff so if you do just buy it you do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get an advantage it's not massive but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you get an advantage um i don't know how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> big it is i mean from what i understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not that much it is i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously any advantages should be a big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> no-no in video games i think yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but especially a children's game as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like you know what's next [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> tetris with the microphone's actions in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it like well i mean you know technically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> speaking that's it's not the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pokemon game with micro transactions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right i remember pokemon go back in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> day yeah and even then i felt like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was like it's weird man yeah it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> strange i feel like nintendo they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like well if another company develops it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is true that's true pokemon was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also not them yeah but they don't but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then nintendo also does weird other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> microtransactions or uh brand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> partnerships like they're [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> mercedes and mario kart 8. oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah mercedes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what was going on with that what how did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what what i thought it was like a joke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that someone at the dev team threw in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then i realized oh no it's an actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brand like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> how did this happen what's going on and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> she battles me i mean i pick it up every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> time i play mario kart just because it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hilarious yeah it looks so stupid baby </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mario in a mercedes yeah just a full </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mercedes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i've never played mario kart 8 so i this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is the first time i'm hearing it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a dead ass </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> three mercedes cars and it's just it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> just hilarious to see baby </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just in the game in the game always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since release it's not even like an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unlockable it's just there by default </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can just pick a mercedes if you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what yeah you didn't know this i thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you guys were membing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a straight up mercedes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what the [ __ ] is going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like when you select the car as well it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> literally says mercedes where does this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fit in the [ __ ] mario lore how how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> did this happen well you know if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know mario was like i'm sick of going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> through all these levels let me just hop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in my mercedes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> over all the enemies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know at least ea you know you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> getting into you know i mean nintendo i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't figure out what the [ __ ] they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trying to do i don't know what they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> doing everything they're trying to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> everything man this is bizarre yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mean i get it whatever i mean good on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> them i guess man i just think i get that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> grinder get that coin man i just think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately like uh microtransactions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just like kind of creeping its way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> into the future of gaming because it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just yeah it was just sad because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> nintendo obviously was the one company </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that for a long time was like no i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but then now they're like yes yes yes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yes yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> because like genji's come along and just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> prove like how much [ __ ] money there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is to spend on anime wi-fi apparently </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's like it's it's ridiculous </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i remember i watched the uh i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> watched the live stream of the new </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> genshin announcement for like the 2.0 in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> azuba where they announced the new area </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i think it was getting like almost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 400 000 people 400 000 people on twitch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on twitch not youtube twitch live </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> concurrent which is like how much does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like press conferences on on like ea or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like press conference like e3 and stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get it's not that much like 100 100k max </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it gets like 100k 200k maybe like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this again shin update </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> stream was getting 400k viewers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> concurrent on twitch which might be the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] is going on which mind you or a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of the stuff that they announced had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> already been leaked </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> as well so it's like people are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> tuning in to like look at lead ship i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> mean like it's confirmed i guess yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mean i i'm sure if i was a fan i would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get behind the high field yeah i'd be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> very happy for it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean yeah i mean you know obviously it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did very well for them right like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but yeah it just blew me away because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like i was like oh there's a game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shooting stream happening yeah 400 000 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sitting there waiting for a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> update like are you serious and now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more gacha </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more waifus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean like i haven't haven't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> gotten back into against you and i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> been thinking about it because of a new </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> area but you know even like out of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> three of us the person who was most of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the integrity was probably me and now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> she's like that's this is a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people watching an anime anime waifu </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> game right now could you imagine if like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] like if like fake grand order </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had an update and there was 400 000 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people like watching i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> don't do that to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't give me hope </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is genji in like is it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm sorry is it majority played on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mobile or pc i'm assuming pc i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it would be more majority pc i mean i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> think so right yeah because i i i did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> not have a fun time playing gen channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mobile um at all i think i think some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people just played on both like when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're home they're playing on pc but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes you know they got to get on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that grind while on the go well i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i think that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of like the biggest advantages that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> genshin has over like a lot of triple a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> games which is the fact that it's so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] easy to play yeah you know you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you literally like every account is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> linked and now you can like even link </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> your ps4 account to like every other </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> account so it's just it just makes it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like ridiculous is it on the switch as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> well it's not yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it does it does i mean is it on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> switch yeah and apparently there's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> full </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the problem when i'm a fan of a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> lot of things i also end up promoting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> unfortunately i've fully disconnected </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> myself from gaming hype i don't get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hyped about games anymore i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if that means no happiness for me but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i've i've just stopped getting hyped and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i've stopped watching announcements i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> think i've just stopped getting hyped </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> about things in general because i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i've ran into so many situations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> where i just get hyped and i either </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experience hype fatigue </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> fatigue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fatigue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> so i had to experience height fatigue or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> end up getting disappointed with the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> final result right and i'm just like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well then what the [ __ ] you know give me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back my hype all right yeah so now let </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me pack my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still waiting for my cyberpunk hype </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> refund like i'm i'm firmly of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> mindset you should never pre-order a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> game ever no no never no no matter how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> good or 100 it looks like amazing or the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bonus deals don't do it it's a bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> practice and i think it's bad for gaming </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is here we go here we go for gaming </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> man it's sharks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean it's it because like i'm not into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> gaming as much as i used to be and even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> back then i just i don't think i've ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pre-ordered a game or at least like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think the only game i ever tried </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> pre-ordering was gta but that was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like because it was gta oh yeah do you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> remember like it was like 2 000 picture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 2013 everything is a pre-order bonus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah literally like everything is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pre-order like no everyone is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> pre-ordering everything that's just how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is you pre-order [ __ ] everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but luckily now everyone's chilled out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was insane but i also think kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of back then it made more sense right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because back then the game you're buying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the day was the game you were getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right there was no updates no patches no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> nothing and it also made more sense </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because we it's just i think it really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> hit its peak right before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe just during online shopping </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> started popping up yeah right right you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know and this is before when you didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really want to download it because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> people's internet speeds probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> weren't good enough to really get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> download a full 20 gigabyte game yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that but now you know people's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> internet speeds it's not really a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> problem yeah and also back then i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like you just had a lot less choice of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what games you could play you know as a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kid i'm just like yeah i waited like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> four [ __ ] five months for the new </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mario game because there was nothing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> else to look forward to there was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally nothing to fulfill that void i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't i couldn't get a free-to-play </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game like genji </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> playing games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like fortnite or league of legends or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anything like that there's nothing to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fill that fill up that void the only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> games that i've pre-ordered are the ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like i know 100 i'm going to love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i've ordered every single like mario </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> release of late and i haven't played any </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> well that sounds like your problem i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> because i think the last game i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pre-ordered was uh final fantasy 7r but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i 100 of that because i knew i was going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like it because i liked the original </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like persona 5 royal as well i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pre-ordered that because yeah i liked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the personified i mean i i've i have so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> many [ __ ] games that i've bought in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my library that i just have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i've downloaded them i've installed them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i just never know for them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i've never opened the last time you got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really hyped for a game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> final fantasy 7r probably did it live up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to your hive yeah 100 percent of it what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you gone was that fantastic game and it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> got very exciting i haven't pre-ordered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it like the last time i got hyped for a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game cyberpunk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm not joking that was the last time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [Music] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because i was just like great it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sci-fi game it's cyberpunk this looks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like everything i've ever wanted to fill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> up that void that mass effect has just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> left for let me left me for years and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> now that hole is even deeper and now the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> hole is ashamed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of therapy with it as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm like every few months i just google </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's cyberpunk 2077 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i saw it i saw a good i saw a good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> article it was like cyberpunk is nowhere </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> near a no man's sky turn around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the devs are like we're nowhere near </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fixing it like no man's sky </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something like that according to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something like that i was really it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just how they said they had to say a no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> man's sky turn around of course i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that that is like no man's sky is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] anime redemption of the gaming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> industry i think it's like one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> only redemptions that's when the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> antagonist turned into the protagonist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because most companies you just cut your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> losses and you're like [ __ ] it make the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> next [ __ ] fallout yeah yeah [ __ ] 76 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> make a new one yeah you know it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when was the last time you got hyped </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah as the gamer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> borderlands three i was very hot for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> borderlands throughout that was a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay uh no all right i was extremely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> hyped for borderlands i absolutely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> borderlands two is one of my favorite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> games yeah because i was gonna ask i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> never played three but i played two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> great i haven't played board once what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> was the sigh they're gone i just i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> realized i just realized what the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before okay well cyberpunk 2077 what the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> last game i was hyped before that i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bought lens too right i loved </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> borderlands uh so i bought borderlands </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one originally on the xbox 360. right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and uh i thought it was [ __ ] i hated it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because i didn't have friends to play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with so it was terrible game to play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> alone but when i finally went back to it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> months later my friends bought it went </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on more more sale i just went cheaper </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sorry uh and yeah i loved it i thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> wow this okay this game is actually sick </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you play it with friends then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> borderlands 2 came out and it looked </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like they just improved everything yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they did yeah and it was amazing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bought lens 2 is such a good game and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> playing it with friends is like amazing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like this this game is so much replay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> value with friends um and i absolutely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had like some of the best gaming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> memories playing borderlands 2. so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> naturally borderlands 3 was coming out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i had a monster gaming pc yeah i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ready every all my friends were getting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it there's endless people i could play </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with it was going to be good yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so i play it and uh yeah it's just kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> of like borderlands 2 but with like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> worse story like the stuff they add </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't very good wait since when have you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] cared about story well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> borderlands 2 actually was such like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> handsome jack is such an uh engaging </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> villain oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [Applause] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's there always making you laugh right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and that was something that even if i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> didn't care what was happening i knew </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that i liked handsome jack and then he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was funny as [ __ ] yeah i loved having </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that and the and the two main villains </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> were like youtubers or twitch streamers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> in the third one right and it was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cringe because i'm a youtuber and twitch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> streamer right so it was cringe watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that i am the bad guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just like poking fun at me in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like the worst way right and i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this isn't this isn't the representation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i asked for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this is slander </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm all down for when people make fun of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> youtubers and twitch streamers i'm all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> down for it but sometimes they do it in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a like a way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in a way that you've clearly never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watched something because there are so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> many other things you could have gone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like you know they do the whole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing of like oh hi guys whatever and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they could have gone for like why don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you thank me for like the 10 donation or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> something like that right that would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> have been funny as [ __ ] you know like bo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> burnham did a great parody of it i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bye-bye used to be a youtuber oh yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously he did a great parody of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> twitch streamers and stuff and that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> great but i felt like it was a terrible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> parody and it was also they were just so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unlikable and there was so many bugs in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it as well like there were so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> game-breaking bugs that just happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> throughout and i was like this shouldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be happening i waited years for this i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got hyped for this i felt invested in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> give my high back i didn't really like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any of the characters that you could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> play as yeah which kind of sucked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> borderlands 2 i felt like every single </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> character was like pog yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because like the game i think the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the game i got hyped for before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cyberpunk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was uh this this just shows my track </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> record and why i don't get hyped for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> games anymore right it was mass effect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> andromeda i thought you might say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> fallout 76 yeah i thought you might say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i thought you were saying this guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> fallout 76 mass effect andromeda </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i love donkey's video i don't know i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> never played masturbate i've just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> watched these videos on them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> andromeda was so funny i think i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> played like an hour of mass effect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> andromeda and i'm just like this this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this just isn't doing it for me right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by that point like i i think i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cyberpunk was just uh yeah this looks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like a game that could be you know could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> appeal to me but i think mass effect was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really what just killed my soul right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> right there's something so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> heartbreaking about it in a way that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i've never experienced when a game just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> lets you down like that yeah yeah it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> feels like your dad just never came home </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you know like it's like damn but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it feels like your dad came home </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but with a different woman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is i don't know it's just it's i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like that's the first time you get to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really experience betrayal as a young </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> adult yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a true betrayal i trusted you yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> followed you all the way through and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is how you repay me i stuck with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you for years i had memories with you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i can't i can't i've never even had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with anyone else and this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's gone like that yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean like i i just i just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> now i just try to keep as little </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> knowledge of the gaming industry and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like what's coming out sports well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was [ __ ] amazing oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> horizon zero dawn i was like what the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] what what kind of game franchise is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this i had no idea what it was about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was [ __ ] amazing that's why i'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hyping myself up for breath of the wild </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> too right because i don't want a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> andromeda to happen you know like god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> forbid it never happens but like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never know right so i'm just gonna like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm just gonna wait </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and also like i you know i've seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone streaming a lot now um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know when e3 happens or nintendo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> press conference i was like did you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watch it did you watch the e3 conference </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why would i watch an hour of ads why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what so i can get excited and give my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> money to a company that's going to let </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me down no no thank you i'll when the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> game comes out and i hear it's good i'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> buy it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why would i sit down and watch an hour </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> conference of getting myself hyped for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something that i probably won't be hype </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about i know i think it's pretty fun i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not even sometimes sometimes i'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like sometimes when like i still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember um when final fantasy 7 remake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was announced and just the reaction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around that i'm just like i haven't i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't give a [ __ ] about final fantasy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i'm [ __ ] hype </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> meanwhile me who never played final </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> fantasy i'm like what's going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> meanwhile i was the one guy like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in the crowd yeah and then they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> announced like shenmue three afterwards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like what kind of press conference </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is this like i think i was more hyped </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> about the press conference than the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actual games themselves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that turned out to be a great game huh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no but i feel like it's a little it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a fun little you know um event you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know if you're if you take part of it i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> just feel like you just want to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hyped it's like the nintendo directs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right that's like another one where it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like did you watch it did you watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the nintendo ds there's something about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nintendo directx that really pissed me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> off i can't put my finger on it i get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> angry watching nintendo directly well i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know why i think it's the way they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> present games that clearly no one gives </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a [ __ ] about they'll be like and now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just dance 17 and it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> why but they always they always have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> sandwich it between two big titles right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah which is like you know fair enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right there clearly no but it's also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just like i don't care about just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> dancing sometimes they do like ad spots </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think for other companies to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where they give i think it's i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's an ad spot i think they do this and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they'll show a game that looks awful for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 30 minutes and they'll just like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> play through and i'm like stop this stop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this right now </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_06> i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't know i i think i'm just getting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to that point in my life where i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> becoming extremely bitter about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything that makes other people happy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> welcome to adult things i think i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm getting this it's called being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> adulting and it's called being british </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as well it's like the worst combination </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of angry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think i sit there on my porch just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like rocking my chair thinking oh you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> young kids getting excited over games </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> that's probably why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why why i have to have prerequisite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> knowledge of another game well compared </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the original it's much better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i love the original i like the original </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> two but i think the new one just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> improved on i mean i love the original </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i was a kid and i had yeah zero </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taste in video games everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm sure i'm sure oh sorry i don't have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> tasted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm sure i pissed people off saying it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> terrible i just i played it and i should </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i was so bored out of my mind to playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this game i mean clearly it's just not a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> game made for you right why why is it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not i would have loved this what's going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on what's going on why do i don't why do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i hate this game you sound like the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> crowd it's not toxic enough you sound </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like the same crowd of people who are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> pissed off when nintendo released like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the nintendo 2ds which was intended for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like five year olds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i thought it was affordable and uh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i like the ergonomics of it it looked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> cool it looked like a [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fisher-price like yeah i like children's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> toy and adults are like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> nintendo how dare you not make it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> how dare you make a toy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> company i'm not one of those people who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> gets angry at nintendo for not making </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> adult-oriented products right that's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that what they do right but you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff like pokemon i wish that they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would put a difficulty option or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> something where you could add something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like like that i wish they would include </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something the toxic game right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what is that insane of me to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ask pokemon to include like something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that makes it more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> into it that allowed you to make it more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> difficult or to do certain things i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't understand no i don't i don't i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> don't think i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> disagree with that because like i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like purposely leaving it open-ended to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like how difficult you want it is what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> makes that game so appealing to people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah if you put a difficulty like if you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> went into a pokemon game and you were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like choose the difficulty immediately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people will be like uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> actually actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in regards to difficulty i [ __ ] hate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> choosing difficulty i hate it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> so much it depends on the game it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> depends on the game because unlike so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some games it's it's completely stupid </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> necessary right like first person </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> shooters like i hate it because it just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> makes them more spongy yeah that's all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it does but on some games like pokemon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like okay this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even even a 12 year old probably find </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this too easy like especially the number </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one the new one was like the new ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like hold your hand that's why it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like beyond mine like even like you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you you play players that's that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the problem with the game itself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> right right i feel like i feel like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is a game design yeah i feel like even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> adding 10 more difficulty to this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like what like it's pokemon platinum i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was playing that i did another log but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like even the core game itself was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually kind of challenging like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not it's not you can't just like fall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> asleep and just spam one pokemon well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the thing right it's like i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the problem with just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> pokemon games in general where like like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i played sun and moon right that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> holds your hand the entire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> even as an adult and i'm like dude like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> 10 year old me was crying trying to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> past like gym three of silver right but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and the game couldn't give a [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was just like just get good it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> figure it out yeah you're ten you should </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> start thinking bro stop thinking [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> ten years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly i feel like nowadays people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> people have less patience when it comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to completing games yeah there's no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> there's no way making a pokemon gym </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> slightly harder is hardly asking for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like like it's not we're not even dark </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> souls level of difficulties </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm just you know there is you should in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a pokemon game i think even if you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 10 years old you should fail the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first gym probably and be forced to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like maybe i should buy some potions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah maybe i should consider doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> something not just [ __ ] steamrolling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> this [ __ ] with my mudkip every time just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> give it like good game design so that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't have to say anything to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the player to figure it out right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like you know i i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even like when you're when i was like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> much younger kid you know when i was 10 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whatever playing these games i hated it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when games were like completely like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> steamrolly like you could just do it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> without thinking yeah it's like having </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some form of difficulty there is good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's also important i think for the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kid to learn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> everything is going to be [ __ ] easy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exactly like i remember like when i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was [ __ ] like eight years old playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mega man 2 for the first time yeah and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like this is [ __ ] impossible like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no one can beat this [ __ ] love that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game though it's one of my favorite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> games of all time because i learned to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like i learned success through failure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kids have it too easy now these guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is that as an adult i have absolutely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> zero patience for games that are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] hard right kids do not kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> will play the [ __ ] oh yeah yeah over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and over and over again because it's one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's probably the only game they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> getting yeah and also there's nothing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it's not that's that's that's that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what i'm trying it's not an email that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's what i mean that's the point i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trying right yeah no because i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> there's just games are a lot more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> affordable nowadays yeah back then you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> had one game every few months maybe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's still most if they're getting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like an xbox or something okay yeah they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can play fortnite for free on it but if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they want to buy another game and it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> difficult they're probably gonna try and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> complete it because they bought the game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> when they wanted it for christmas or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something right adults try to understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kids </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just thinking from my perspective i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know maybe maybe i mean most of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them are just happy with like fortnite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and stuff right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i think the other thing as well is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at least with like the old games is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know because they could only be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so long that they literally had to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like all right this game if you blast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through it yeah you could probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> complete in less than an hour exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like we want you to play this game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a long time so we're just gonna make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it [ __ ] hard to the point where 40 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> minutes of gameplay is going to take you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about 40 days oh there are a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] moments in a lot of older games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah and i i remember thinking back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and i'm thinking how the [ __ ] did i like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> play so many like levels of battle toad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and controversy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i did play battletoads it's actually a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> really fun game oh it's a good game yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a [ __ ] great game </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like to this day as like i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> playing the [ __ ] motorbike </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i played it like for a full week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah in my room trying to complete that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] level yeah because because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember beating mega man 2 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> lots of times as a kid yeah and then i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> recently played it a couple of years ago </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i could barely get past [ __ ] wood man </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i'm like how the [ __ ] did i do this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> as a tenure oh it's because i literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> spent like a month of my life just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> grinding also i couldn't play megaman of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my age i'm going to get a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> carpool tunnel like i i tried playing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> man x i'm just like oh i'm getting a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] crap here if i'm just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> doing like the wall jump jesus christ my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's great though i love it i i guess </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm i guess i'm angry that i'm getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> older and these children games aren't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> getting older with me yeah i guess so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i like with difficulty i like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've i i now like when a game has just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like one set difficulty even if it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm so like i get anxious that with any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game or any piece of media where i want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to enjoy it the most right i want i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> wanted to enjoy the most on my first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> playthrough and sometimes i've had games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where i loaded up and i hit i hit the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> difficulty level selection and i'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm getting anxiety just now i'm already </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> getting anxiety you know what maybe i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> play this game another time this is why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i like games uh even if they have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> difficulty options they let you just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> change it on the fly yeah yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the consequences for it and it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like all right well this cut this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> section's kind of [ __ ] i'm gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> knock it down how do you feel about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people who like purposely select like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> easy mode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well like what it depends on the game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's some games where i'm like you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> actually just like not playing the game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if you pick right because it's far too </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> easy but like there's that whole like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stigma i i guess like connotation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they're like oh you're not you're not a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> real gamer if you're playing it on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> youtube good scrub like levels of things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but i mean it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously if i was there in the room </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> with them i'd be like almost wrong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> little baby you're not gonna i'm not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna click normal but you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> on the on the podcast and if if a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> general audience asked me i'd be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah of course well can you pick pick </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whatever difficulty you want yeah right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but obviously if you're my mate i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> going to i'm going to play play baby </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mode mario oh yeah yeah i'm like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> playing america </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> no you're not no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> no no no no no no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean it's different right actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you'll poke fun at your friends yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] around with that but i obviously in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> general i think that you can play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever [ __ ] difficulty you want all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why would it why would i can why does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> take away from me just have fun just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> have fun if you want to be a little baby </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] you could be a little baby [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> don't care you have the right to do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you paid the strength you have the right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be a baby [ __ ] you pay for 60 bucks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get to do it yeah you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also you know i think it's it's good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because not everyone you know obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some people have disabilities as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they can't play the game on the hardest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> difficulty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they can't do it you know i just think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> accessibility is good in gaming i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that one of the things that pisses me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off most and it's always the japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> game companies that do this is that like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the accessibility options in their games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are terrible like they don't they don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let you change anything no button </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remapping none of that i love it when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> games are like bro what do you want to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do what do you how big do you want the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the character models to be or what now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> about so how bold you want the outlines </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to do do you ever use button remapping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah all the time i really i i've never </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> used it in my life i love button </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remapping and i i it pisses me off that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of games don't do it and a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the indie devs are normally the ones who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> include a [ __ ] ton of accessibility </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> options that's a lot of like pc games as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> well yeah like it's not not a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> console games have but yeah happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right i mean the the beauty of console </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> games is that it's just plug and play </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's very simple you just put a disc in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever or do you download the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you just start playing okay so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the the argument behind accessibility </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> options and button remapping especially </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like um especially with people who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> are you know maybe someone has a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> disability where they can't use one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their hands properly and maybe there's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> button where they can't press jump yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they can press the jump button with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> this finger right so the idea is that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even though yes this is probably the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> best layout someone might out there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> might have a waysier time with this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> button being on this this one right so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just give them the option to remap no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> no why wouldn't you yeah no i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely not against </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've just personally never used it yet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah nintendo's got a lot better at it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as well i think actually i think so uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they're awkward sometimes with it um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and also like colorblind options uh the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> last of us had like amazing uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> accessibility options like you could uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could change it so all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything in the thing was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two colors like it's all gray and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> models are just like bright red and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bright blue so even someone who's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> completely like you know has really bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> uh case of vision can play the game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they can see the models outlined </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you can also just turn stuff on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for yourself like you if you if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> prefer color like a lot of people play </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> apex legends with like the color blind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> settings on to change the color of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bars and stuff to make it more visible </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right you know i just i i i think that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> especially oh another one okay so i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going on a round now this is one thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that i think is there's absolutely no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> excuse why this shouldn't be an option </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on every single video game subtitles why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is there not subtitles in every single </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> video game yeah they have the script i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hate it i hate it like i hate games i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> agree with that i hate games that don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have subtitles like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes i don't want to have to like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> listen to it at full volume yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes maybe there's explosions and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] going on i want to read it they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> have the script just plop this [ __ ] in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it just it's just like what is it about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> not just gaming but like movie audio </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> mixing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> especially if you like i remember i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> watched uh nightcrawlers yesterday with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sydney and um you know it's uh it's we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> watched a few movies and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we were we turned up like the tv to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> almost full volume yeah characters start </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> speaking which is like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what is that subtitle option and then we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> turn on the tv to full volume and it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> still like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> i literally had that happen to me when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> watched interstellar like last week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh my god it's a fantastic movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't get me wrong but my god and i love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> matthew mcconaughey but man like like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> listening to him is like listening to a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> subwoofer that barely works </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because when they're mixing these movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> they're mixing them on like these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gigantic audio editing suites yeah you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can hear everything i'm like no edit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> this [ __ ] on a [ __ ] uh airpod bro so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can hear what most people are going </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to listen to like one when they're when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they're listening to them like it's this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing scene you know when like matthew </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> mcconaughey is giving this like really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like intense speech yeah and all i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hearing is just these [ __ ] organs and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that man he's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know what you're saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> speak up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like i said some of the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the audio mixing on like video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> games as well it's just it's it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watching a bass boosted meme you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where the dialogue </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> is like so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> quiet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your ears get [ __ ] destroyed but i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] love youtube videos so like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> small youtubers he's like audio is way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> too [ __ ] quiet and the music is like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> done </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't [ __ ] hear them and i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> know why i love it it's my favorite it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so charming i know it's so pure i love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it but yeah subtitles on video games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is why this is why we need it even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like especially even in your own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> language right yeah yeah so yeah there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> should be absolutely no reason why they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shouldn't be subtitles these have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> write the script to the game just put </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the [ __ ] script into the software </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that can do this yeah right just yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> someone has to time it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i hate how it's like a lot of games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the default is off yeah yeah yeah just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> make it on yeah and if you don't like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> then you can turn it off also i think a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lot of games is why i'll do this and i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think every game should do this is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> they let you choose how big you want the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> text the color of the text the outline </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of the text shadow and stuff so you can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get the subtitles just right so you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> again if you're if you have if you can't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really see very well you know you should </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't understand why games don't just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> give you all these options i get it it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> crunch they don't have time but i mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like all right well just [ __ ] the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people who can't play the game like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone else right just [ __ ] them right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah [ __ ] them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is why like everyone loves to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> clown on xbox and and i get it you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm an xbox boy myself i love xbox yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i think xbox have done some of the like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> most amazing things for accessibility </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have you seen the um the controller </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they've made </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> uh it's done some amazing things like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's so cool that like xbox thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to do that because they're probably not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna make much money off that right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah that's not something you make money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> off of so a lot of the companies won't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do it but you know i thought [ __ ] fair </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> play to microsoft man like i mean yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that's great cred right yeah i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like why wouldn't you do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're looking out for all gamers out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> there yeah and uh also you know just a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the term gamers has just like been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> reporting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> for the record i meant that in all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> sincerity all right please </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> any any any game company or whatever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that spends money and time to develop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stuff for you know uh accessibility </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> options that they know is probably not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to be valued by 99 people yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's mad respect yeah of course well i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel like you're praised i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in terms of customization and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> accessibility well not maybe not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> accessibility but definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> customization it's always been the pc </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gaming crowd that's been like leading </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> leading the charge and you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously xbox microsoft you know it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it kind of kind of feels like it fits </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> within their ip whereas nintendo is kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> of like the apple of the gaming world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where she's like this is how we're doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you can buy a peripherals you you can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> buy your improv rules it's also gonna be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> operational it sucks right because like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> imagine it like miyamoto's there this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kid who can't use his hands and mimo's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah you don't get to play my games </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why because you don't make enough money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to make money do you millions of dollars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no bye-bye you know like it's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why would you deny someone the option to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> play your games you know like i'd like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to think that if something happened to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> me or you know uh if i had a kid who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> loved gaming and and he wasn't able to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> use the standard controller </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'd want to think that there's a chance </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that he can play his favorite games </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i said he like i know it's a boy of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> course it's gonna be a boy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i won't allow it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> girls </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> disgusting you know i i just gave you a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> girlfriend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they don't exist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not hard to make something that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like that that you can just allow </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> someone to customize you know obviously </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you still need help from someone else to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> help set it up for you but yeah you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what i mean i don't know why why not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> pisses me off yeah why not like they all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> these companies have all this money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right like at least spend it on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> something that you know like nintendo at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one point yeah i think a year ago it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the most cash cash rich company in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean did that pandemic did they have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> been watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cash lying around make a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> accessible controller nintendo [ __ ] me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stop making joy-cons that don't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> work </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> god damn it i'm making joycons that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> break after six months jesus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it literally is like an apple periphery </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is like oh breaks off the system </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> let's just just buy a new pair it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> about a friend who is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> he didn't know anything about joycon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> drift </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and they were like yeah i don't know how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> much joycon drift you don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything about joey i obviously don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> play my uh it's when that's enough it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when the d-pad just does so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unfortunately there's a massive lawsuit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> going on i don't know if it's been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> resolved with nintendo and a bunch it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a class action um essentially the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> controllers after like a random period </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of time they just start drifting the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> joy-con like the the joysticks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> right it's not just the joy-cons either </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the pro controllers do the same thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and it's been a massive problem and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people have to buy so many joy-cons and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> drinks aren't cheap they're like 60 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bucks yeah 67 it's ridiculous and um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and they just they drift and i had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a friend who was playing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and bless them they not really a gamer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were like yeah so when i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> playing it sometimes i just go to the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> side why is that i'm like first time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yes so nintendo made a shitty product </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that doesn't [ __ ] work so you have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> deal with it buy a new one if you don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it spend more money yeah nintendo </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> says they'll fix it as well then they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have like warranty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i think the last thing that something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that happened to me was uh the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> infamous xbox red rings of death oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bro that was such a debacle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what a [ __ ] clown fiesta that was man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> did you have to send your xbox away to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> microsoft no no so like i i did this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like [ __ ] gorilla tactic that i found </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the internet of like now now that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know what i'm doing i was just basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> overheating the xbox so what you do is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you [ __ ] wrap a towel around it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then no i'm actually serious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you wrap a towel around it and then you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> turn on the xbox and leave it for like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> few hours so you're just basically over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you're overheating and cooking your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] cpu or something you think it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a 4chan thread to set your house on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fire </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like what the [ __ ] yeah very very much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like a uh fire hazard but first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> arsonist for some reason for some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> inexplicable reason it worked and i have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> no idea why wait wait so do you want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> explain what the red ring of death is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for people who don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um so back when xbox released their xbox </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 360. they rushed it out and it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> poorly manufactured yeah had many </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> problems right so if you bought one of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the first consoles first generation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> consoles that were released um you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically had a time limit right it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically like a year or two and every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> xbox had this where you play and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one day for one reason that nobody could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tell it just wouldn't work right and so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you would get the three rings right so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when the xbox turned when the xbox turns </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on right you would um you'd see like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> green ring around the power button yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah and basically there were it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was split into four segments and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh the red rings of death meant three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> segments were red which was mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something was wrong with the startup </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nobody like we called it the red rings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of death because everyone had this issue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i know and it never got resolved and how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you would resolve it is to basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> send it back to the manufacturer they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> cost microsoft billions yes because of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> all this [ __ ] because it happened so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> often right and my friend i had two </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> friends about it so we had a group of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> four of us who all played xbox yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i never got it thank god i would have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actually cried because what my friend </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> had to go through sounded like my worst </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> nightmare as a 16 year old me yeah he he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> got the red ring of death and he had to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> send it back and then they sent back a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> box that an xbox that was refurbished it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was someone else's and it didn't work </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah what so and again like this so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're just recycling xboxes apparently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they had they were doing stuff like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it was pretty widespread so you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sent it and they called them up again </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is like over months like this took </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i think it took like half a year to get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it fixed overall he had sent about like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> three times before they finally fixed it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then and then it broke six months </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> later and he just gave up he was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm not doing it again yeah i'm not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sending it out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean this is that that literally like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> scared me to death i was like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> thought of my xbox dying i was like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is my only this is my lifeline like if </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_06> just like you're praying for like a few </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seconds of silence you're praying to god </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you're gonna get the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and yeah it's and when you don't you </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> building his [ __ ] world yeah that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the adulting version of that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like if your friend was driving and then </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> like oh look he's angry yeah no [ __ ] he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it might as well be [ __ ] life </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doing something to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if that kid actually turned off his own </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pc that's funny you know if he gets </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> angry yeah this is his fault he did yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but when you do to someone you know it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like okay just because you don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> understand the hobby and you don't </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_06> did you think that was a good idea </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah how does it make you feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so tragic [ __ ] man we're a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> person rorschach test that's terrible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> did you ever find [ __ ] like jackass or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something funny back in the day though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but that's because i think it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was new and it was unheard of and you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know as well when it was on tv there was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of disconnect yeah i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that disconnect from tv is just gone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because there was always like i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know as it might not have been true but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as a kid i was just if it was on tv then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there was always that disconnect of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh this is maybe staged or they sorted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something out it's or people in that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> video got compensation of some form well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because you know when when jackass did </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> those stunts in public you know even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> back then the rules were the same you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can't just upload any footage of any </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> person's face you have to get a release </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> form yeah so they were that means that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the person they pranked clearly signed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> off on it yeah because you have to get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the release from or they've blurred yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and in that case it's like all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well i like jackass back in the day but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that tho the ones where they would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> do [ __ ] in public with like just you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know random people in the streets i did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> not like watching those just because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like i felt bad for the people who got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> involved right what was it but i like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the ones where they would just like do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] with each other and just laugh at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> each other like those are [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hilarious but yeah but you know also </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that even with jackass right a network </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is standing off on this they all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> following rules right the problem is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like when people are doing this in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> public and they're doing it on their own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no rules there's no release </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forms there's no procedure around this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and even if you aren't going to prank </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone you can't just show their face </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like you have to get a release yeah like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's it's a mess and uh i think the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> problem is that because they've we've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seen this on tv the younger generation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think that oh okay well i can just do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it's like no no no no no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> there's lots of adulting things there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a reason why all the big prank channels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fake fake the stunt uh the pranks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it gets the point otherwise they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't get away with it yeah you can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like getting release forms is a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nightmare and also you know getting the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> even getting the reactions you want is a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pain in the ass and then you get you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have to get them to sign a release yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> so it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of prank channels just are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and they died yeah well nearly all of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> them like a lot of them ran into trouble </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> vitalia whatever was in prison </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah went to prison in egypt what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> did he do he climbed the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> pyramids oh yeah that's right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and then and then when he got let </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> out he was like it's the worst thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> ever and then he got out and then went </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and beat up some old woman </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> he jumped old woman in like santa monica </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> he actually went insane like he like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> beat the he nearly killed this woman </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] i think i don't do pranks yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> because i think the the the one story i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> remember was like two kids uh oh that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was the two the two brothers who uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who faked a like a burglary or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like that or fake like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and they got the uber yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> then they got the uber and the uber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> refused to drive them and they were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what an [ __ ] uber driver who wouldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> drive us and i was just like what what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is going on in this world right now and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they thought it was hilarious and the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people yeah and like millions of people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> found that hilarious it's tragic yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like you know that that prank where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that oh what a prank or that challenge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> where that guy tried to uh see how many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if a book could stop a desert eagle or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> which you know right you have to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> can't help but left and the ghost </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> girlfriend literally shot the boyfriend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she killed him and it's like it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is tragic because like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people obviously getting these ideas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from watching this [ __ ] online it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] terrible i i think pranks are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> generally just dodged </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and any prank that isn't like a very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like chill prank on like someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you know those pranks are hilarious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right the ones the ones that always end </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with the person getting pranked laughing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah is like you know the ones that are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like fine spray your housemate with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> water you put a pie whatever that's all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good you know but like i just think when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're doing it to strangers and they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have no say it's like and and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> something that could hurt them or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something like genuinely scare them like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you could be traumatized if yeah some of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these absolutely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] that no just like just like don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> be an [ __ ] basically it's it's it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> such a fine line because you know the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the line between a lot of psychopaths </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they don't know what that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and uh you know unfortunately we live in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> a climate where a lot of times being an </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] gives you good you're rewarded </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you get rewarded for it yeah and it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunate man we're just like growing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into like old bitter old men aren't we i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just jesus man i don't know if it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i've just been on youtube so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> long man that's just some genres i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like to be like elitist and look down on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> genres of youtube yeah but pranks is one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> of the challenges but then i do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but then i certainly will for the pranks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah absolutely that should have died </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> long ago i mean and luckily they have i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel in a lot of ways but i i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they've died on youtube but now they've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just i think they've just migrated to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tickets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they they started on youtube and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> vine was also there was so many prank </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> vines as well and then now i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they've just both migrated to tick-tock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> as well and it's just i've been watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of youtube shorts and i just lose </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> my mind watching this stuff why are you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> obviously just all reposts yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah but like there's some there's </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_06> they just feed it to you yeah and you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't think it's weird right like i feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like we're getting to the point where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> content is being forced down your throat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like not what you're choosing to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> watch right right i mean there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> there's some content on tick tock which </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was just so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> weird because it's like it was almost </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like hypnotic because there was some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's some content that it's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had obviously like millions and millions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of views and it's just like some very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> oddly satisfying thing or something or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something i don't know it's it's so hard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to describe why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> not invested but just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> intrigued by it yeah but i wouldn't call </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it like interesting content it was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like oh that's uh entrenched couldn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> take your ideas that's a bit that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a bit interesting all right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> next oh oh okay that's that's pretty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it wasn't like i was never like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> emotionally invested in any of this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> content which is why i kind of felt like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> almost hypnotic in a way because it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't give you the time to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> emotionally invested right because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> over in six seconds yeah i mean i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i've the only funny tick tocks i've </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> to know i want to know where to find a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good content because you can't search </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like you can't search for anything like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you can but you have to sift through </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like if you look up like a hashtag </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right that if you happen to find one or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like an audio file or something that you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thought was kind of funny that's been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> used right like you can search for that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but in order to find like the actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gucci you just have to sift through so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> much unrelated [ __ ] i had like a few </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> audios of mine like get pretty big yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like from my youtube videos i was just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like what the [ __ ] is this because it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was like really bizarre things like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there was one where it was about me like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> saying sucking dick or something yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and cosplay and it like those so many </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> people who used it to make tick tocks i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was so confused because it was like he's </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> no time to talk i need to wear cosplay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and suck dick or something and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> had a couple of tick tocks where they've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> used my audio i like it though i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's interesting it's it's really cool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's like oh that's you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's kind of flattering that they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thought it was funny though i just feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i think look at it i'm like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what's going on but yeah but at the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> time i'm like that's cool but at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> same time i look at i'm like why are you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> well i just thought i was thinking i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like surely i've said other things in in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> an order that are more entertaining and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> more useful than that like of all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> things i've said you thought this one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean that's how the internet is right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it just takes things off i don't know i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know it's weird we don't we don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know how to tick talk yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> have you ever like legitimately thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being like i need to start a tick tock </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i i'd like because there's lots </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of youtubers right now who are like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm not convinced the tick tock audience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well the demographic i want right i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know i like the demographic i have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right now yeah i like just chill and do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> mine things streaming games i mean it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like i think we've grown up we've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> brought we've like made an audience that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like us for us luckily enough and like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the content we make i don't feel like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> need to move myself on a different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> platform just because that platform is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> getting popular right it's kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah we've definitely grown with that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> well our audience has grown with us yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's kind of like why i i get so many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> messages about this about god why don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you use instagram why don't why don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you post more on instagram </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the simple answer of i just i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] at taking photos okay i just forget </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to document my life i'm sorry i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that okay and it's just you know i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why i get my girlfriend to take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> photos of me because i'm so [ __ ] at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taking photos of myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just like you know you you get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brands coming to be like oh instagram's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the you know instagram for the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> viewers and the most like audience and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the biggest numbers and i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> well is that really valuable just going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on a platform just because it's got big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> numbers and a big audience or is it like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as a content creator i find it's way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> more valuable even if you're promoting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to a smaller audience that it's an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> audience that is more suitable for the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff that you're making right right so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm not going to make a tick tock just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's popular unless i think i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually like tick tock well i think i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> can make good tick tocks you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because otherwise i'm going to get a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bunch of audience that i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> understand or yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and then and then i will literally be </SPEAKER_05>
