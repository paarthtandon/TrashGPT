<SPEAKER_05> - The thing about this
like frail Asian kid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wearing a beanie walking around. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You look like a fucking cancer patient. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like, "I'm tired of this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna change my style." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right?
- Lemme get there, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So I went for the skinhead look, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (chuckle) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I looked like a complete... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs and claps) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I look like I just came
out of prison, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (bright upbeat music) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Hello and welcome to another episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the Trash Taste podcast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I am your host for today, Garnt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> that is a real name I can assure you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm joined today, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with my cohost Connor and Joey. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The ones with the real names
- Real actual names. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The actual real names. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The actual real names. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Me, the wisest man on earth. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ( Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So by the time this comes out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this would have been very old by now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but we haven't really got a chance </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to have, had a real debrief
on our cycling special. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because we filmed an outro </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and that turned out to be 26
minutes or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we were just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people gone
- originally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Originally people, we were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> people don't wanna hear us
talk about a special day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they've just seen.
- Yeah, by the way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you haven't watched
the cycling special, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You should go and do that before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're gonna talk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we talking about that video.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So if you wanna watch
that link down below or top </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - On screen now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I think the biggest thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean obviously the reaction for that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has been absolutely, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd say awesome.
- Awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But what I found funny was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how seriously people took
when it came to discussing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> who won and who lost and who cheated. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - In that cycling special. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - There was, I've never
seen like our subreddit turn </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> into like just the most like, "No you" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Top of like thread
- It was a fucking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> free for all for a good
period of time there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was like fucking team Garnt </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> and Joey versus team Connor
battle is this like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is this how the twilight
fans I'm wearing the prime? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I mean I get it you
know, they they're invested </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - They invested
- I appreciate it, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is a good sign,
which is a good sign. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah but I mean okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think I'm very like,
I'm very fake salty, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I'm always like, fake angry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think we are all fake
salty and fake angry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like in real life as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll get like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll start like getting like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll sound like loud I'm
like, "Yo this is fucked up" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I'll be like,
"oh you really count </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like no, no, not really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ( Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Am just like ,I just like
getting annoyed about things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a way that isn't like,
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Twittering.
- That's very British of you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (joey and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah yeah yeah British, very British. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Am so like I can't believe this! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God really like, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't wanna do this shit
- Like no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean like , you know, the cheating. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like at the moment, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure when I found out
you cheated I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "motherfuckers." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I probably just
thought through like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> alright well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then obviously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause there's also clips
said like me talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about it on my live stream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> but obviously like I play up the saltiness </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cause I it's good to
showmanship, you know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It is. Its fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. But it's unfortunate that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> a large majority in the internet
doesn't understand sarcasm. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude that was so I, there was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> an all subreddit people discussing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who cheated, who really
won, who is the real winners? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Who done it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I there's just one comment, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't remember what it was called </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but they were like big man Connor Cahoot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> thinks he's a real winner, real chad huh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor's friends,
cheaters when he cheated, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was getting so angry about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - And it was so funny seeing how like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the fact that there were so many people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who are infinitely more
saltier then we are like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we didn't give a shit like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - What its like now it's like to us, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's we make the video, we film it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If someone cheats you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and it makes for good content </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then its make for good content. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean originally I remember
going on a cycling special </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think I, this got cut out the video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but I remember telling Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah I'm gonna do the whole thing because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its pretty wild time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even if I don't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'll feel good if
I do the whole thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then so the fourth
challenge happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then Joey suggested the cheating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and I just thought to myself </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that would make for a
really funny segment, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if we can actually cheat.
- That's exactly what it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like yeah sure, you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> saying that "oh I wanted to
take a fucking free car ride" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd be lying if I
say I didn't want that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But ultimately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, no, no, no let's do this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> because it will make for
great content and it did. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not about the race
it was about the friendship. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was about the friends
we lost along the way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is apparently each other. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - True true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, because like I feel like, you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a difference between </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously none of it was scripted, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which we don't script what
happens on the specials, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but we all still, you know, we all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we do still have that voice
in the back of our head </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that says this is going to be content. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - People are gonna watch
this for entertainment and-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Cause let's be real like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know there was a
part of me that was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know, I'm sure
there will be some level </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of entertainment factor if
hypothetically all three of us </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with no excellence whatsoever... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Completed everything
from start to finish. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But, you know, it's the little
bits of unexpected drama </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that makes for an interesting-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Its the drama, its the banter, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like that's what makes
for the interesting video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I feel like part of this discussion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like we laugh at it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because we know we
didn't take it seriously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm glad people were that
invested in our contents. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To really go balls deep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to really like break down
the levels of cheating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like okay I had like I swear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some people could make a spreadsheet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like every little thing that we do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Such that--
- No its like thesis papers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like the dream cheating thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing)
- Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - People gonna start
hiring like astrophysicists </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> who cheated technically
I though I got that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was a one in seven trillion chance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that Garnts chain would
break at that very moment. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was one call and I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why didn't Garnt just
put the chain back on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I did think that, was like did Garnt, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why didn't Garnt just
put the chain back on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually this wasn't,
there's a lot of my, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, trying to fix
the chain did get caught up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but it was like completely
lodged in there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So like, the reason you
were waiting so long for us </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was because I was like trying
to unlodge this fucking chain. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then like I got it back on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then it came off again immediately </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was trying to figure out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what the fuck was wrong with my bike. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I had this like half
an hour to 45 minutes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where I realized that I
had gone the entire cycle </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> without first gear. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So the reason that the
reason the chain came off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was because when I went
to the highest gear. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It just slipped off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It just slipped off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, these bikes were very cheap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah and like I realized why
I was suffering so much now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> on the fucking hills was because., </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You were in second gear. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - You were in second gear the entire way. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was in second gear the entire way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I also love though how like
there was so many comments </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> even on the video being like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "oh man this seats are too
low, the bikes are too small." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like look, that was the
biggest bikes they had there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Those were the biggest bikes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I think I did adjust my seats </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be the highest it could be.
- To the highest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because these people are
designed for Japanese people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because we didn't buy the bikes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there were the rental bikes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from the locaL bikes place there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - We had to fly it to the
other side of the country. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so we couldn't bring bikes with us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - These bikes were definitely not suited </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> for six foot foreigners that's for sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Speak for yourself Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Five foot gang over here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But even for your size it was small. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was just maybe okay for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But I'm really pushing it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like it was... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah 'cause I remember I put my seat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the way to the top I was like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh no this is the highest
it goes I'm gonna fucking die. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay we're pretty fucking dumb, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - We're not that dumb. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But I saw comments that were also like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> "did they ever use any gears?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like bro you know, you would know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if we didn't change gear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause Garnt would not be
moving up any of these hills. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You think Garnt could
pedal at six gear up a hill, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was already suffering
enough on second gear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let alone fucking sixth. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like some people pretend
like it was the first time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we ever saw a bicycle
with gears like that day. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like, "what are these things?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Lets just leave it alone. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't realize until I
saw the footage actually, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> how much of a clown I looked with like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this fucking mini bike. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You do look like a fucking clown. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You did look like a clown.
- With one massive legs, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just like peddling along. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're basically like one
of those like the kid bikes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like young and
they're like sitting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> by the feet are going like over here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that's what you look like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're like kneeing yourself
in the rib cage every time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bad dude squalts every time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh man I'm glad people
enjoyed it but man, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just it's not that serious guys. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was just a little bit of fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean there was a lot of like fluff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that got cut out, shout out to Mood On, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for editing that and going through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Jesus! How much footage did we have? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - A hundred hours footage Joey. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like a hundred hours between us. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause it was like we had the six Go Pros. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like one terabyte of footage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We had six Go Pro's,
four, so two Go Pros </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> between each of us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then also the Handy cams and whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The drone.
- The GoPro in the camera. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The GoPro in the carrier as well which is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why it took so long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We filmed that in October, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why the production took so long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> For our next special we
probably won't like scale up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> until we have like a super super big idea </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe try something a
bit smaller, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - For our next project.
- I feel like at this rate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it's just gonna get like bigger </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's gonna turn into like
a mist a beast tale Dante. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - If we don't scale back a little bit... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean cause we the ones
mainly arranging this as well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so we have to come up with
all the equipment we needed </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> to figure everything out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and so like it's quite a
lot to do it for all of us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, like I kind of realized this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when we were doing the thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then Connors tire popped, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and every comment was just
like, "wow, I can't believe they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't plan for like a spare
tire or something like that." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And yeah in hindsight, it sounds
fucking stupid, doesn't it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But you have to understand
that most of our planning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> went into how the fuck are we
going to power six Go Pros. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - On our bicycle when we have one car </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and none of us near each other. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So we were trying to figure out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the logistics of trying to get this films </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and that's where... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The last thing we're
expecting was a pop tire. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah these bikes were like extra heavy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause we had like duct tape
the shit out of stuff to it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like that was like portable batteries. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Strapped to these bikes.
- Its like a brick </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just to like keep the Go Pros on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And also Go Pros as such
the fickle things are amazing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when they work but the
moment like there's any heat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they just stop working. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Because we realized this
during the drifting special. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Because people look at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this content and think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they don't see the
fucking effort and logistics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that goes into this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause I didn't think about this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> until I had to go out and film it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah they just think, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Oh just buy some cameras and
attach it and turn it on." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - So with the drifting special </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of Connor's footage just got lost. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Cause like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a shame. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause like, the one when I was
doing like the sick donuts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like all of that footage
was lost 'cause the GoPro </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just overheated in like five minutes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Its 900 degrees inside the car. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah because it's an oven in that thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and mine turned off,
luckily yours guys work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- And mine kept dying </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in the second half.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah it's just sucked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause like all you get
to see as an outside shot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't even look like I'm in the car </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> doing that fucking the thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you missed all like
me getting hype screaming. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Spoiler it was a stunt dog. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly, like that's what it looks like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It could look like a
stunt dog I so said like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's my drift, that's mine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I recently watched
this horror movie with Sidney, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't remember the name it's
a Korean horror movie right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But the premise of this horror movie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that there's this company who basically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> does live stream content, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so this company
hires a bunch of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from the public to live
stream going into this like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> haunted asylum. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And you know live streaming
there experiences there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (clears throat) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so I was watching this movie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they had this like jank
set up with some Go Pros </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that were apparently like live
streaming to this base camp </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that was like a literal camp. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That they had set up outside
this mental asylum Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And when I was watching this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I couldn't get invested in the movie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cause I felt like that guy doing like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "YouTuber reacts to
YouTuber movies," Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And all I could see in
the back of my head was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they these Go Pros don't
even have any spare cameras, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fucking lie there they
were like live streaming </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for five hours or something like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Two out of 10 not realistic. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah yeah there's no
way that would work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also, how are they getting
signals in this mental asylum. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> There's no way the stream
would be this clean, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> while they were streaming, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> quite inside of it.
- Inside 5G twitch backpacks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ( Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Where are they, they didn't even have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the fucking 5G Twitch backpacks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Like this is fake movie, two out of 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh my God, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean I like to do something
like that but like just, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know, the the fucking
effort it would take </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to just try and organize the
technicalities behind that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just sounds like a
nightmare in and of itself. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean to me
twitch like IRL streamers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're just built different
I don't know like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't have the duo man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think you have to be
another level of like masochist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think to me it seems like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> why would you wanna just
be embarrassed in public? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like constantly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I don't mind doing it
for a video every now and then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah but like having it constantly on, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause at least in a video
when you're out there filming, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> when you're out and about they're filming, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least you can like edit it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so it's the most interesting things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that happened on the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if it's an IRL stream,
you see everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's just especially when you're not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even in the safety of your own home either </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're out there in
public people can see you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people can judge you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And to me that's just a level of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the dystopian future
that I don't want in my life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Not to... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh go on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh just saying like not to mention like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> in Japan especially where
people already fucking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way too wary about filming and pumping. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I don't know how you can just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rock up to an Izakaya full of people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and just be like, yeah I'm just gonna put </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this camera here and just
start talking about our dream. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I don't know I
couldn't do that either </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know I haven't tried it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like I don't know how I would get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> over that mental barrier, of just going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into around restaurants,
like having the phone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in front of me and just
talking to the phone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Am too British I can't do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- The thought of going into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just a place and doing that is like, what! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well just like on the street as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't get like J Vagus for instance, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> can like just be walking on
the streets by themselves. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Just have a camera like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and being like, alright guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so we're gonna go to blah blah-blah-blah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and just have people staring
at you the entire time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I've done that and it looks like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a fucking hostage video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like fucking talking
down to the camera like-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah like I would go like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I would go like this.
- Yo what's going on people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But some people just like yep, hello? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hello. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - The giant selfie stick out, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yo this is everyone in EK
Bokuto right now check it out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't know I
mean to me, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I watch some of these IRL streams, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I'm quite interested in it myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I think like oh maybe
I could do it sometime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then when I watch
it I'm like okay cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they did like one cool thing in the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> And the rest of it, like a lot of the time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they were just being like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sitting there asking that child like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what's you just want to do? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What's you just want to do? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what should we do guys? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's like alright. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then everybody get what the appeal was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> cause most of the time real
life is pretty fucking boring. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- It was kind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like traveling or waiting. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think though,
- What's the fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In this day and age, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel it's a type of content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that is like really sold after all. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe right now I can understand that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> but before that I'm like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> why would you wanna watch
someone just kind of like wait </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and sit around all day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and maybe do something
interesting for one hour. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because its like you'll really there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I get it in COVID times though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Isn't this some kind
of like black mirror as, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> okay that we're getting oh no like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't wanna have a day myself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna watch someone else have a day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm gonna give them money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like, it's literally
that fucking meme image </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> of you know that kids sitting
in front of the poster </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and being like every podcast they like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Its like really what that is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - The meme just keeps getting
posted on WhatsApp right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's literally what that is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cause like for me like I feel awkward, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if I have a hands-free
sets and I'm just in public </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm on the phone.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah yeah.
- Like sometimes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd have a hands-free set </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I have the phone up to my face </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to look like I'm talking on the phone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I do exactly the same.
- As opposed , </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> as opposed to just
talking to myself I dunno. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah cause the other day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I had to go by like some
like eyelashes for Rocky. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I went to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the local local pharmacy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah the local pharmacy and I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fuck I don't know which one she wants. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I tried to like take some pictures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and send it being like yeah
pick out which one it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she just fucking calls me
and he's like, just show me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing)
- So I had to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> flip the camera.
- Bitch show me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm just doing this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> while talking on a hands-free set. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And these all women are looking at me like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what the fuck is this guy doing? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> ( Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They pretty understood
during the eyelashes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just like filming eyelashes
and being like which one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know why I find
like only IRL content is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where it feels little
black mirrorly to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a little weird I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like no other type of content
- yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> makes me feel in that weird kind of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like no other content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> makes you feel like this is too far. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like IRL, just something about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes I'm watching it I'm like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is this weird?
- Well because I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> If you stream in like say
a studio like this, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's like a performative side to it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's almost like a stage
or like a setup for all. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah like there is literal sets </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> that's we perform in like this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah
- Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - But sitting down for like three hours </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> at an Izakaya wall like
having a casual beer, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's a little too realistic. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Do you know is well like I saw </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of them like a lot
of them get like drunk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of the time and that's
like the audience loves that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They love it when they get drunk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause they're like,
Oh they could fuck up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they could say stuff like.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - So the audience
constantly eggs them into </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> drinking even more. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah people are drink and people are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like waiting for the
next like string fail. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And this is, and I'm like fuck </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's a horrible relationship to have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> with your viewers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Where they just wanna see you
fucking, fuck everything up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Its probably why like most.
- Yeah. I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like even though,
even though you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's an IRL stream, you
know, when we're streaming </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we do have this performative side to us </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that we just talked about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That we feel like we wanna be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well want something interesting to happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or we at least want an interesting
conversation to happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I feel like it's a very, I
dunno like unhealthy kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like relationship to have with
your viewers at that point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you have your best interests is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for something to happen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you are in this performative side </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I've talked to a few IRL
streamers who have done things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on their streams, which they
probably wouldn't have done </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you know, nobody is watching. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you defiantly
like fake confidence. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. Yeah.
- In the stream watching you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly.
- I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> isn't that way like the
whole generalization of like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, fun bases of IRL
stream is being like supper... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pretty fucking toxic.
- Toxic yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I know a couple of viral
streams in Japan as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know, they're all lovely people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, off stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I think it's because of the fact </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they have this
really toxic and you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> quite aggressive type of audience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that loves to egg them on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To make them do stupid shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or, you know, fail in some way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that they kind of get dragged into that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And they, you know, hate to say it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> A lot of them on-stream turn
into a bit of an asshole. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But that's also because you
know, you have thousands </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> sometimes tens of thousands
of people being like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Yeah do this thing that makes
you look like an asshole" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> for our entertainment.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's kind of unfortunate, its like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know, if you're being
an asshole, you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that your audience is enjoying it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and the acting you want and you can, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can almost get lost in the fact that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "No, I don't think I'm being an asshole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I think I being entertaining." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right. I think so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But then, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you see them when you talk
to one-on-one you realize </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, they're actually quite normal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They nothing like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they are on the screen.
- They nothing like this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> They're really nice most of time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know. Yeah,
maybe I'm overgeneralizing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't met many, but
the ones I have met a very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> different how they act on strings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I only really know like a
few who will like exactly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> the same, but I feel it's a rare breed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. But, I feel, I
completely review with like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> IRL stream content being the
black mirror kind of content </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> as opposed to any other stream kind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of content in my opinion. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm not sure why maybe
it's because it's you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it literally is like kind
of like a slice of life. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Conner] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Where it's, it feels a bit too intimate. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel especially when
it's those IRL strings </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where it's like it's not the
camera pointing at the person </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it's like shot in POV. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like that shit especially is like, Whoa. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's weird. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just, it just makes you think like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where's he gonna go from here? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_07> what we were doing until
the day of filming. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So in the back of my

<SPEAKER_07> It's still weird. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. I mean, it's it's, I mean, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I remember when YouTube went </SPEAKER_07>

pretty much you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can say anything was a prank
and just like, and just get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> away with it.
- Fuck the prank thing. </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. He killed his best friend. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Wait, what? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Remember that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Have you seen that one? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So he did a prank </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where he would kidnapped one
of his, two of his friends. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then he would pretend to kill one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of them in front of the other friend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was a prank </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was like just a prank.

<SPEAKER_05> - This is a huge deal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. Huge. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> People, people were honest also about it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Apparently so, that's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's pretty fucked up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's like, in the video, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you just see this like, </SPEAKER_05>

breaking down, crying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> And he's like just a prank bro. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - He just thought his
best friend got murdered. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> So of course, naturally
your natural response </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is to freak the fuck out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just mentally scared
my best friend for life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just the prank bro. </SPEAKER_05>

pulled a gun and shot him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause he was trying to mug him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean really. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I mean, it was self-defense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean he's fucking right,
what's going to happen? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's just, to me,
it seems so you're literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in America, everyone has a gun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it's not even just in America </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> in any fucking country,
what can you expect? </SPEAKER_07>

pull a fucking knife out, </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_05> Back to the show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Speaking of our souls online </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and people acting like assholes online. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Going back to the cycling special. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So we've we've I mean, we've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's funny how we've talked
about like online privacy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> So, so much on this podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. We've we've talked about it a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and sometimes I feel like
we're beating a dead horse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> because we're just like yeah. You know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we have a lot of crazy stories. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So it, it kind of surprises me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when there are still some people out there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> despite how many times
we've talked about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Will do some, not pretty, not cool stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. I mean, so if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you haven't been following
my Twitter, so yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Someone tried to leak some
monk photos that I had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which were private </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> on my mom's Facebook and
know, I mean, I, I said this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I said this on my Twitter
longer, but you know, I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I purposely didn't release
it because you know, it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm fine people knowing that I was a monk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> meaning that aspect just, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meaning the knowledge or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I was just like, I
kept that part private </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you know, there are
like quite intimate photos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a religious ceremony. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So I didn't, I didn't
want that part of my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause when you were in
initially told the story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember after it,
you're like, yeah, boys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't wanna share a photo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm pretty sure he said it on the clip. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I'm pretty sure on the clip. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We were like, I think
one of us said like, Oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> we'll put the pictures
and then go was like, no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't wanna put the pictures. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I think I might've said that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Maybe its been awhile.
- Its been a while. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember it being like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you didn't wanna share the pictures. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sure, I understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's, you know, it's become a meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm completely fine with, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being the monk has become
a meme, but yeah, someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone literally stalked
my mum's Facebook, which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, it's, there's, there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a difference between, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I fucked up and you know, I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's some part of my
private life that, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I forgot to private, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> send an move, but you
know, as a public figure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you can expect that people
are gonna try and dig </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> into your past something like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Which is fact in and of itself. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. I mean, it's we, you
know, we can talk about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that fact that we kind of slipped that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you kind of do have to expect that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it just felt dirty that
someone tried to stalk my family </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> especially like my close family. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's actually fucked. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. And like, these are
really old pictures as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So they would have had to go back years </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and years worth of like,
my mom's pictures died. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> She had creepy to think
someone's just scrolling. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How bored are they? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And, and like, all this,
all this for a meme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, I'm like all
this for like a single meme. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, the person knew that
they were being scummy as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> They even like self admitted
that they was like scummy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. I know this is a scummy low. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, no, because I, I
feel like, you know, we, I mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we literally talked about
this last week where, you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the barrier of privacy between reality </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and what's entertainment is like slowly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> slowly drifting apart
and slowly being erased. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I don't know, it feels
weird, funny experiencing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that for myself and
being in the crossfire. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Sucks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I had to like tell my parents. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause luckily my parents, you
know, they're mega boomers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So they, they think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that Facebook is the play
you can always have, but yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they never signed up to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I still have to tell them like, listen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if anyone asks you questions about me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or like anything private about
me and try to get anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just tell them like,
okay, don't answer it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just tell them to ask me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, if, even if it's like you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like someone claiming to
be like a government agency </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which like, I think somebody,
I can't remember who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> called them up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And asked somehow got my
parents' number or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like tryna ask them
questions about me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, don't,
don't answer anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. You know, if the police want me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the police will find me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. I mean, it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like don't parents, don't
anyone who claims to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be anything don't fucking
tell them anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's sad that you have to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. I like the thought,
I think it's just really sad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that I would rather be harassed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a hundred times personally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than my parents be harassed once. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean I just couldn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Cause they got nothing to do with it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Why then ask them to get involved. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's hard enough raising
me as it was. Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like the way I learnt. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - The little shit that you are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The fuck that I was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna have to give them extra work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> after they're trynna enjoy
retirement. You know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It it's, it's been kind of
funny seeing the transition </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> between like my, my parents leaves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause my parents were like
really technologically illiterate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I've had to basically
teach them everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's been funny seeing
the transition between them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like not understanding social media at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just like not using it at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then transitioning that
to like transitioning that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to most of my family now use Facebook. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But remember when Facebook was
just like a cool kids thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and like the parents,
parents didn't get it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - My parents still, they
still take it that way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They still think it that way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Cause it was really funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause I remember one day, cause
I, you know, I've, you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we are all grown up on the internet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and especially I've been doing YouTube </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and social media for like a long time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But one day my mom phones
me up and this, this was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this was when I had stopped
using Facebook by this point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'd like, most of
my online life has gone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to Twitter because that's
my job and everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But my parents had just
started really getting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into Facebook and you know,
being, being that, being </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that parents who, you know,
tag, tag you in everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> comment on people's photos,
you know, properly involved. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I remember she phones
me up one day and she goes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Garnt, someone left a mean comment, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on one of my photos. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What do I do?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, "what'd you mean mom? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What, what'd you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What do you do?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she's like, "ah, I
don't know what to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It makes me feel sad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I kind of want to reply." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, mom do not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do not do this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Do not reply right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Do not get involved at this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the one thing you should not do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was just funny because, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like years ago she's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> she's like, you know, just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just ignore all the mean comments online. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It just don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> As you know, as the parents
do, because you know, as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as someone, as, as a
parent watching a kid does </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the social media and do
YouTube, you just don't get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You see comments. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're just like, these
comments don't mean anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. But it was funny seeing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seeing my parents who had
never been into social media go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> through the same cycle
that we had to go out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We had to go through being like, what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> what is a mean comment? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why are people commenting
mean things on me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This doesn't make sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna reply. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna give the trolls
everything they want. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - At least your mom wasn't like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "do you know the number
to the cyber police? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I need to report a crime." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like my mom's like, my
mom's really smart about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, cause she's been using </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do you know about this
website called Mixi? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think it's an annual brand anymore </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but basically it's like,
it's really old web. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's basically like the
old Japanese version </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of like my space or like
Facebook and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't even think it's around anymore. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Basically. My mom's been like using that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So like she's had a pretty
good understanding of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, privacy can
be very easily leaked </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on the internet if you not careful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So like, my mom has openly
told me, she's like, yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I follow you on Twitter and Instagram </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> but you'll never know
which account is mine. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> That's some death note shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> She's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like she just uses like
a completely separate name </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and like doesn't use any
photos and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, I'm glad that,
you know, she understands that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, if she used
her real face a name , </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that could lead to a
whole lot of problems. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Meanwhile, my dad is like, you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking openly comments on
my videos and being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's my son. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's my boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I remember one time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, did you see the comment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> on my latest on your latest video? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, no, I get, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get thousands of comments every day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's like, Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll, I'll send you a screenshot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, and he's
like, "Oh you might've it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I don't use my name on it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But instead he didn't use his name on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. It's like a completely
different username. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But I knew immediately it was my dad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> because the comment starts with, "Hey son" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - That was pretty good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - "Hey son, I really liked this video. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The editing was done really well." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He's like, "you'll never know it was me." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Yeah. Yeah. Sure dad." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's so fucking wholesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's so fucking wholesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah but the problem is that like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> when I was still using
Facebook back in the day, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like my mom would use a
completely like separate name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like, you know, it
was fine or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But my dad would not
only use his real name </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> but would also comment on
every fucking thing I posted </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> always starting with, Hey son. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hey guys, Joey's dad here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so like, I had to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and so like one day he came
in being like really upset </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at me being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Why'd you block me on Facebook son?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> "cause you keep fucking, stop commenting. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Stop opening a comment with, Hey son." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your dad sounds like such a fun guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's a great guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like I had to, I had
to literally block him </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> on every social media. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just because, he kept fucking doing that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And now the only, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The number one harasser. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> And now the only way I can get in contact </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> with my dad is, get this through email. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Email. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't have like
a number or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. Okay I have his number, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but like, you know, obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's international,
costs a bit of money, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I was like, Hey dad, you
should start a line account. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause everyone in Japan has line. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone in my family has line. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. It's like, if you guys don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> LINE is like, you know, Facebook messages. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just a messaging app
that we use in Japan a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, you should start LINE. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, I don't wanna start
another social media son." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "dad,
it's not a social media. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> This is just a messaging app." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And he's like," all right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> All right, fine. I'll do it." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And so I added him and I messaged him </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I was like three
months later he came back </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> being like, " hey what's up son?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> So I was just like, I was like, all right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess I'm just sticking
to email now with my dad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> if my dad ever needs anything </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll just be like, just email me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's urgent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've got to email him right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Urgent. "Hey son." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now every one of your comments
on everyone of your views </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is gonna sound like, "Hey son." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, that's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love the Tenderloin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. I guess that's good then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause then now we'll truly
won't know which one my dad is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing lodl;y) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> The comments section is
all going to be my dad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's going to have to try </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and find something like
a new phrase to go with. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hey boy, Hey boy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I love you, dad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just joshing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, were we talking
about internet privacy? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess internet privacy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, I don't know,
like I've, I've never </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess this is the
first wake up call for me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I've had to really think
about my internet privacy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It took me way too long
to make my Facebook, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my Facebook privates. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was, that should
have been the first stage. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But, I think the problem with
internet like celebrities </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> or whatever nowadays is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> that there's a difference
between say it's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you know, someone who's
signed to a big film </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or someone gets picked up by music label </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like old school celebrities
who there was this system </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> by which they got picked up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they knew they were
going to be famous. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But the problem is
anyone can be famous now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Anyone can have their
privacy leaks and you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not really think about the
consequences of really going </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> through their entire past
and just making it private </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or making it not public because
we were, we were teenagers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> We don't remember every
sites that we signed up to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I dunno how many,
one of my like old forum </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like old anime forum
profile pictures are still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like public or whatever, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I signed up to a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of sites back then
because I was a teenager. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I it's, it's something
that you don't really think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about when you don't make
content on the internet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you don't no one
really expects to be famous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, no one really
expects to have an audience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I feel like I, I do wonder </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if like the newer generation
is gonna think about this when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whenever they do anything or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if we're just gonna
continue to be stupid kids. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That don't really think about anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wouldn't like to, for
it to be the first option, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> if I'm being honest, just
cause like you know, again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like, I think that
whole prenotion of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, you know, you, you should expect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your privacy to be, you
know, hacked and slashed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because,
- people shouldn't be that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that weirds me out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, what is it about
suddenly being, you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> quote unquote famous, you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> regardless of how you
view, you know, fame to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's suddenly like,
Oh, well, you know, you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have a presence on the internet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that you share openly
with a large audience. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So that means that you know,
you don't have a privacy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> If it's on the internet,
it's not private anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's literally like the same argument as </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like old school paparazzi. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Have you ever seen any fucking interviews </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with like any paparazzo photographer? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> It's the most, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're all assholes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. It's the most like
you would see these people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> openly being assholes and they're just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're proud of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're fucking proud of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I think I remember the
last one I saw was I think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Anthony's like sitting
down with a paparazzi . </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. I saw that one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Literally everyone he interviewed </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> was just the biggest classy asshole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - yeah. Because, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they do the whole bullsihit of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, if I don't do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone else is gonna get it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like, how about
none of you fucking do it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then it sucks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause like I think, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm sending people
again who are watching this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are like super chill. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't think like that way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All it takes that 1% just
to make your life hell. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, and that's unfortunate. Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause you know, I don't, I
don't have any resentment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to mine, like audience
or anything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's super fucking nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Its just a shame that
some people are just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm a fucking ruin this man's life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a shame that, you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to change your
behavior for literally 1% </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the people watching you
and you know, that most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> most of everyone that you interact </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with is just going to be a
generally nice cool person. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then it just sucks that
there's that small percentage </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that unfortunately it's
that small percentage </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that ruins it for everyone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's I guess </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess that's just the
world in general, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. But you know, we'd be living </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> in a Utopia if everyone
was being honest in, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Flying cars </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - With lying cars by
now, that's not the case. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Some of us are still
walking on the ground. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - A bit sad. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - A bit sad. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was, I was watching this
video they're there and it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like some blues clues,. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Blue squats? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Trust me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is really okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Sorry. Did you watch Blue's
clues when you're growing up? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Of course what's blues clues. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> All right.
- What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, blues clues is TV show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was basically this guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who was like talking to the camera, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like Dora styling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is where it started
this kind of style. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> And maybe he didn't know, but
I'm definitely popularized </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah popularized. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Where they would be like a, a task. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And there was this, you know, a notebook </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and they'd have to do
extra amount of tasks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It was a really good show actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - And there was a dog called Blue. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - And so the dog would help Steve? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Steve yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Steve find all the clues. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I always wondered, I was
like, why did you stop doing it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause if you, if you watch the show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he basically swaps
halfway through the show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with another actor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought, "Oh, that's weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why, why did that happen?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So turns out that he was losing his hair </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that he didn't want to
like go bold on like TV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. Right.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, and then I was like fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That hit me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, oh my God, fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause like, I mean okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like tons of comments about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, it's frustrating. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause like, I don't really give a anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I've gotten over it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, unfortunately
my dad did not give me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lucky dice roll with my genetics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I am going bald eventually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's gonna happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And obviously it's been
happening a little bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's so frustrating
that people will like go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> to other videos and be like Connor. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. "Did you know you're balding?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I'm like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Pointing it out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And it's so frustrating. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause the thing that bothers
me is that like, again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I fully accepted that it's happening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know people are gonna be
like, have you tried doing this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you tried fucking doing voodoo? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like, yes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Try doing voodoo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cause people are always
like, Hey, just try it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause people are always
like, Hey man, just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> take these drugs, do these things. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, honestly like done
all that, tried all that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Unfortunately, like I
can't do surgery either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I just kind of got to
the point where I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> all right, I think I've
tried enough things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm like this fucking sucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. But can't really do much about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I kind of got over it,
but it's really frustrating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I said, when people go
to other videos and be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bro, you're balding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, like I I'm, I am
aware, but it's frustrating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that sometimes I have to
like edit videos differently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause it's like, all right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If I don't edit this part out, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> people are gonna comment about this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> instead of the fucking video. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And only comment about that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Its like, I just
wanna focus on the video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's so frustrating that
feel the need to point it out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause it's like why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, I, I
know exactly how you feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I too have not been
too luckiest with my gene pool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, like literally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey I envy you, perfect hair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So Joey, like pretty much
everyone on my dad's side, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who's a male. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Same with same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. It's kinda sucks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I Mean it's something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I knew was always going to happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't think its gonna happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean like as, as like when you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> when you're a teenager,
you're just like, Oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, I'm, I'm, I'm the exception. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause your hair like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> when you're like 18, your hair's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Its lash. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck man, my hair is so thick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Thick as fuck and like
you think I'm the exception. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I remember, you know, I've seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like my entire family on my dad's side. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone's bold, so I asked my dad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen like pictures of
my dad when he was young </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he had hair down to here, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - He's bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. He was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh he had drip. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But yeah, I, yeah, he had
a, he had a lushest of hair </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I saw what it looks like now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'so dad, when did you
start losing your hair?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just out of curiosity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> So just so I can take a look
and take a look at my own hair </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he goes, "I guess,
late 20, 30 year old." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And I asked this when
I was 28, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Fuck dad, why the hell you
did not tell me earlier, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for fuck sake." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like, I can't,
I had a, I had a feeling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's probably gonna happen to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, I didn't like quite know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then I realized, okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my older brother is like
10 years older than me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> He's going bald. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, Oh shit! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Am starting to sweat a little bit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - See the prior example. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I like, you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I totally get why kids
think it's funny to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mock hair lines because
you just think like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> its never gonna happen to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. I've got hair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My hair is fucking luscious right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's never gonna happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is it like fucking two
out of three, especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're whining. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I think two out of three
men get like some signs </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of hair loss or what happened. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I remember like I thought, okay, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if it happens to me at 30, no biggie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> by then I'll probably be chilling out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll be settling down when
I was like 21 or like 20 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I started to notice just a little bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it's getting a little
bit thin and I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what's going on there huh? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Am gonna put time out to that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, even when I was like 20, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I started like trying to
do things to like help it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just, you know, doing
those, like, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> taking it all the fucking FDA
approved, all that bullshit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But unfortunately </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> for some people it is
purely just genetics. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> You just fucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. You just like some
people that helps and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, you do a lot of
research, you look into it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some guys you might be
in a place where maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> the building you're living
in is like really bad case </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of like damp or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Its fucking with like your hair or stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - So some people who, you
know, their living condition </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the reason why they
are losing their hair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, no, unfortunately as much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as I wished I could do something about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just kinda like whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's it's yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess the, the main reason
why I just thought fuck it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll just talk about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause it's like, I've
gotten to the point now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> where I just don't really give a anyway. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's it's like, it's not gonna stop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel like if we just say something </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> especially with the audience, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it's going to come
into being like, Oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the inside meme, but okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I'll add onto it for the millionth time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah Cause you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like unfortunately, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's just kind of a
thing of like, you know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just something that I
can't really do anything about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And unfortunate people are gonna see it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I'm not like I'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately am not gonna, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - You're not gonna wear a hat every day. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just me statically
in front of the camera. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In my head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can't go anything further
than like a 90 degree angle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Otherwise that's a red zone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> so when I dyed my hair
blonde, it wasn't that bad. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause my scalp is like white. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> So it didn't look that bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's when it stops scale Brown </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and certain lighting,
especially studio lighting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking reflects that shit
where it doesn't look too bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> If you look at me like normally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like video where the
lighting is washed out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it looks fucking awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, I see it on video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, fuck! Its that bad? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I check it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, Oh, it's not too bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. But I'm pretty
much at peace with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'll pretty shave it at some point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I kind of want to see how it looked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I reckon you good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> You have you, have you lucked
out though in that regards? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Because the one thing no, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like the one thing is like,
you know, like the fact </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you've already accepted
that you're probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna go bold and then you
probably get to go to whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But the at least the
good thing is is that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> can grow a beard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. There was nothing weirder </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> than a dude who is bald
and has a clear face. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, why are you pointing
my boy, Johnny Shim, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Come on, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> The biggest Dick in the unit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, sure. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know, and that's
why he looked like, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't say that in front
of Johnny shims right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause he probably smack
the dick across my face. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> But like, you know, at
least like, you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a beard on a bald guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> usually nine times out of
10, it looks fucking great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. True, true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Your card is fine. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude. I appreciate you trying
to gas me up here Jay. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like, it's weird
because like, you know, you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you said like, you know,
I'm jealous of you Joey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like I actually had
the opposite because like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have too much hair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Too much hair, what a problem guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, hear, Cause like your
entire dad's side. Right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I think my dad
was born like fucking 20. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. See, my mom's
side is exactly the same. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause my granddad went bald at like 24. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So for the longest time
in my like early twenties, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> my mom and my sister would
just egg me on being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> when you gonna get that hair? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You better enjoy that hair </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> while you still have it on your head boy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All that hairline's receding a bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember when I was like 18 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I asked my granddad being like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> how old were you when
you like started to fall? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was like, Oh, like, like 23. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, I was like five years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> . But you know, obviously I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at that point I was like,
look, if I go to bald, fuck it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll just accept it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I rather just like
shave it all off, then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like leave it half-assed or
I, so I'm just like, fuck it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - The more I thought about
it and the more cause I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't actually get any surgery, even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> though I wanted to cause
like a blood condition </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the more I thought
about, I was like, do I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do I really want to
just fucking desperately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cling onto this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like at the end of the day, I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really think I
give that much for a fuck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> where I think I need my hair to function. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like I think I'll still
be fine without it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's the thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Right? It's like people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like, I don't understand
why people are so, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well people make it seem
like, if you lose your hair, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> its gone because it's
like a bold person, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I sleep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm a full hair, I sleep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Balding free real estate for bullying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Come over. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Come over its where its happening. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause people, I feel like
people just wanna have like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> at least some comments out there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel like, then need to
have like a one-up on you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> They don't feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like they can mock you in some way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But they keep mentioning it like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you lose your hair,
you're not funny anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Since when was making
fun of like certain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to do like genetics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Its like a fucking slam
dunk to me, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like you know, you take
the piece out someone's look. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> No, no, no too far, balding </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> oh free real estate. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like he gets the same thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> When you taking a piece
someone was born with like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do notice like as, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as someone who went through
the phase of, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like just accepting that
they were balding, you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you do go through that five stages. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - First few, I think year
or two where it's happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, no, I can,
I could reverse this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I can, I can reverse this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - The five stages of balding group. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think you do, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - The five stages of acceptance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> First is like, what's
the word am looking for? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Denial. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Denial. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> First you like no,no,no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I'm sure this conversation
where he hits quite close </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> to home to a lot of our
viewers because all audiences </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mainly dudes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. If it is happening to
you, don't give a fuck, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Just whatever.
just whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, you can do whatever you want. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Its not like society
fucking rejects you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because you are bald. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I, you know, I feel like,
you know, some people are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, I, I, for one, I
have been bald before and I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I do, I do want it man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I do like my hair and
you know, I am putting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in steps to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, I, I don't
expect to this forever, but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would like to elongate
it for as long as I can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, I'm still, I'm,
self-aware enough to know that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, once it's
past the point it's gone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but at least right now,
when I still have this hair </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna be like, okay, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna lose this
eventually, but I am gonna try </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and do my best at this
point to just keep it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't think there's
anything particularly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wrong about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no, there's
nothing particularly wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> with either direction that you go to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it's more just, you
know, I, some, some people, I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, I like the
feeling of having hair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like the feeling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like the feeling of, you
know washing your hair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Especially fucking one
thing that nobody tells you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about being bald, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's getting old, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's fucking cold. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. You're either cold. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Or if you're in a hot humid country </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like Thailand, mosquitoes,
it's free real estate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's an extra surface
area for the mosquitoes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just go fucking mental. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I do it just like a park. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Its like, oh shit! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I won't lie, I do you like the idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of being able to optimize
my bathing experience, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> which is like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Your bathing time is like cut by half. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Am like, when you get out,
bro you're immediately dry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That sounds amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know how, like in a hurry, I am. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Single wipe. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - And also like ,do you use the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, shampoo is irrelevant, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah yeah. Shampoo is irrelevant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - You save so much money. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know I hate like
organic fucking shampoo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that isn't like full of
like sulfates assumptions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cap it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. As well, I did have this thought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if this is creepy or what to some people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think it's kind of cool that like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my whole adult life is like
captured in like YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you can see like my
whole, like, there'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can see the progress. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like 19 year
old me that's like spots </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like fucking pepperoni face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And then in like 10
years, you'll see me like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Its the glow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Actually, I think, I think
it's kind of like, I dunno. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think it's kind of fascinating
that I can have like a, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you know as cringy as it might be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can have like a backlog that I can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause what I, what I
find interesting right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is, you know, I don't know what
it was like for your parents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but my parents were like
pretty old right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So there's not too many photos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of when they were younger
and like my age especially. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So, you know, I'd see
photos here and there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> damn! That's what you
looks like, like, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But for you, you know, when we have kids </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> we have like our entire
life just like documented </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that's, that's true
for most people, like, even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> above like being YouTube
was you got Facebook photos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> going back to like, my,
my kid will definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know my entire life up to like university. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, there are some uni
photos where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> damn son or daughter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if I wanna go through this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know if it's
a good or bad thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I lost a lot of my photos
pre 18, like on Facebook. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I post most of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I hated how I looked in them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was like fuck it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, no one likes having those. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but, and I thought,
should I keep them? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was like, no, I'm
getting rid of them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> So I actually, I've lost a lot of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I pretty much have, like, I
would say an average amount </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> of like that anyone would
have someone who took photos. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right? Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think it's cool as an adult </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can make the choice to be
like, I'm fine with having most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of my like adult life
essentially be documented. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's kind of cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, whether my future kids think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah He's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's up to them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm I'm sorry for
any future kid who goes </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. Surely. So I dunno. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like you said, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> when it comes to online media, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I kind of act like a hoarder right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I don't know what I can look back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what I could
look back in, in a few years </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and be like, yeah, I tweeted
that back in 2008 or two. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I couldn't remember when
I started my Twitter, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's been, it's been a while. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Didn't even know that
Twitter was that old honestly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. Because I have, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I have this thing on, I
don't know if you have it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think you do right where,
like I have this thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on my Twitter where like,
if the tweet is older </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> than two months, then
it automatically delete. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that might
set like two years just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause like every time I look back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at myself two years, I'm

<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like that six months ago. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm just like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I didn't look. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I like the ability to look back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and be like, man, I was fucking cringy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like the ability to
look back and go, man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the fuck was, this was
this anime zone hairstyle? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What the fuck man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I got that on YouTube. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what YouTube channel is for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - For Twitch clips, you
know, all that shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> That's what that's for you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I already have like one website to like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> remind me of how cringey I used to be. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I want like multiple
websites to remind me how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> cringey I used to be. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna know what
cringey thoughts I had. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> So, you know, that's,
that's not just pictures. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I want everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't wanna go back to like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> my personal Facebook and
big go back to like 2010 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and being like, Oh God, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why the fuck did I tweet
shit out like that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Or message shit out like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, cause going back
to the bald conversation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. And like rock rocking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and style and everything like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I remember I had to, I had to go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> through this exact process
when I finished being a monk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was just, I was just bald, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And we talked about
before, how, you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can't, you can't really, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's hard to rock a bald style </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you don't have a beard or anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like it's especially
hard as an Asian as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like initially all I
did was just like wear, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like wear a beanie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the thing, the thing about
this like frail Asian kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wearing a beanie walking, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You look like a cancer patient. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like that's, that's, you know, that's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's, that's kind of
like what I look like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> On the outside. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, I'm tired Of this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> You know, I want at least change my style. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So I was thinking, well,
what can I possibly do? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And the only other style I
can think of is like, what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what do you think of when you think, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know, bald head shaved? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You think you kinda, you kinda think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of like somebody who just
like a delinquent, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Someone's like a skinhead. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - You like, it's like a skinhead, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I tried to go for that look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I have a picture actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dug this up during the break. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me see if I can get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, I went for, I
went for the skinhead look. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And for the first, for the
first and only time in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I looked like a complete, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whoa! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I look like I just came out of prison. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You look like Asian Jason Statham. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I kinda love that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's dope. That was dope as fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I saw someone walking the streets. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Its Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have never felt like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> It's the glasses and the scarf. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. This is the first
and only time in my life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I felt dangerous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. I would, I would be
like, I'll be walking down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Move away from me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I was living in
China at this time, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I would be walking down the streets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and sometimes if it,
if it was it was dark, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could see like groups of girls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or groups of anyone just
like subtly cross the road. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Whenever I was, I was okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And this, this one time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was with some friends there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it took me like to this local bar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who's run by this like
frail, you know, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of the old Asian ladies
who run this local bar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so we walk in and
she dead ass looks at me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I could see her have like a mini </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a mini fucking heart attack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She's like, "What?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then she goes to my mate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and goes, "I'm sorry,
we're closed right now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And my mates, like, no, I
I've been here quite often. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I, you know, I know this
place is open as she did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I says to him, I'm just not
looking for trouble right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Garnt is the kind of
guy who you would say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> am not looking for trouble. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean look, I don't blame you, man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like if I, if I was that frail old lady </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel like I would </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I would look at that and be
like, Oh, that's Chinese mafia. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Were you wearing the sunglasses? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And the scarf as well? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was wearing the scarf. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. That's Chinese mafia dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Am not dealing with that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. The scarf says like, it's Louie, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> but I mean, you know, I
kill as well you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - The scarf says I'm hiding tasks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what that say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't wanna see the
tasks I have underneath. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. Looking like this
it felt like you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that meme with that guy
in the party being like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> they don't know him a fair load on me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I kill people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the big coat as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, yeah, I might
be concealing a weapon </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'll never say. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - This is honestly the first time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I ever like tried wearing a leather jacket </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Tom, you know what?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Actually you look
good in leather jacket. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love leather jacket. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is that why you wear leather
jackets a lot nowadays. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Ever since this is where it started. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually looks good on you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The only one I know where it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> damn, he fucking kills a leather jacket. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> up who will like, Oh, you know, I want to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I want to get back into

<SPEAKER_06> like street wear spirit and you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the punk spirit and like
wear a leather jacket. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And it just, it looks so lame. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Some people do look </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like they're just wearing
the dad's clothes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Jackets. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I tried to once
and I was like, nah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's not for me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. For me, the one piece </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of clothing I find really
hard to rock is a good suit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I dunno. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I dunno what it is about a suit, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love wearing suits. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know you love wearing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You use every opportunity
you can to just rock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up when you were jojo suit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Going to the grocery store, suit up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Suit up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Suits is so fun to wear, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It is really fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You feel like you commend a presence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're wearing your suit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, like when I,
when I leave my house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around the Jojo suit, like, like, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I go on the train, I'm
like, yeah, I'm wearing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause like, for me, I
like, I can rock a suit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it really needs to be tailor-made. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause like anything else,
if most like my entire life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> if I just buy like this
stormy too, you know, it feels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just feels like, and
where my dad's clothes, I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I look like five years younger
and I, and that's not a good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not a good five years
younger than it looks I'm back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to being a teenager or
something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Especially as well here,
if you were anything other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than the standard businessman
suit here, which is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what? The Navy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like the Navy blue,
white t-shirt on today. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like nobody made
it, it's like dark Navy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Like they all wear the same goddamn suit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So when I, you know, when
I whip out my little light </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> burgundy, what color is it like beige? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The Jojo beige suit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Stands out so fucking much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Am like, yeah bitch! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I forget. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes you have, you
bought two jojo suits </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because you only wear that one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, cause the other one,
it's like way more formal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's a little harder to wear it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like on just kind of like
not super serious things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah have got the other one, the, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> the butcher ADI one, the Navy blue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> like kind of double standard. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's also like a crossover. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I feel like the crossover is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like more mafia or like super serious. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Whereas the German one, cause
it's just like super chill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like Bay, beige
is not a serious color. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No people who wear beige
don't do serious things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you look good, look good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Explain serious thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like you see someone wearing this suit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like people, mafia men can wear beige. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Here's the Giordano suit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Here's the Bruichladdich suit, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> The Butchuaratty suit looks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> like you've you are killing people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You're trading </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> in stocks that can't be
bought by public citizens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, the journal one
looks like, you know, like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you have fun times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You go out for nice meals,
you know, it's, you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's a different kind of atmosphere. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I go to the gold bar every now </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then it's a different kind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of atmosphere that it gives off. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like wearing a three piece. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't just casually
wear a three piece. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You look so good in the three-piece </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I did something, you
know, I like how men's fashion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no matter how, how much time has passed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Right. A suit and a three-piece
just always looks good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just something that is timeless. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They've just like, we, we
optimize how good guys could look </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like hundreds of years ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then it just hasn't
changed since then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. The standard has
always been the same. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't really spend
much money on clothes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> but obviously suits quite expensive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then you only bought, bought a suit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Will know that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like a nice suit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. Like a nice suit right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You can go to prime Mark and
get the $20 here or whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it doesn't look bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Actually. It doesn't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember I was telling,
like I was talking about on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on Twitch, I was talking
about the Jojo suits </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm bringing out new Jojo suits. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, yeah, I'm
going to buy them all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they were like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Powerful ones right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. And then like the
like 500 bucks each. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, listen guys for a suit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 500 bucks is not that much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Especially if you can go in there and get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they tailored a little bit
to you like this, come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Come on, these suits are fucking gold </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Especially as an adult as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like that's just gonna to last. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> You think I'm only ever wearing
those job Jojo suits now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like one time thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Never wearing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm never wearing any other suits ever. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm in a pretty well, but I mean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm gonna get my money's worth, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And also the nice things
that luxurious man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you gotta like, you know, a good suit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> You can't cheap out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> If you go to a job interview
wearing a cheap-ass suit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come on, come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You go to a job interview
wearing Jojo suit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Instant application. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Presents has been commended you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You walk in right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - This boy is serious and he's beige. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nevermind. He's got a Jojo suit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's got a beige suit on he's. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean that's the thing about the suit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is that it's one of, it's one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of the few things that you
really can't cheap out on them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You can try it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean like, you know, you can go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to places like get a pretty cheap suit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in somewhere like Thailand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like tailor made
and everything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But if you don't have
that luxury of buying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of going to a place where
it can be made for cheap </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then a cheap suit really
shows like most like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When you wear it as
well, what's a good suit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You feel like damn, I'm powerful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It comes off in the
aura that you give off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like some Hunter,
Hunter, Nan stuff, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> People feel your presence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> When you, when you're in a good suit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people know you are in a good suit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They feel it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the way I'm telling you,
man, it's not bullshit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> That's what, that's what I do. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - When I go buy a suit,
I'm just like, excuse me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the aura tailor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly. It's an option though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know it's to tailor-made
when they're asking questions </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like, what the
fuck you talking about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, they're asking you stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, how would you like this or that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never been asked
that question in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What is that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Doesn't they show you like, I don't care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> What do you think? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You're the tailor you tell me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Would you like two centimeters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or three centimeters off your coffee? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. Like when they ask like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> do you want the leg rolled up
at the bottom of the steps? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She didn't tell me what looks good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I literally have no, what do you tell me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause I remember like the
first time I wore a suit was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> for like my high school
prom or something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think that was the first
time for like everybody. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's when you get
like the prime marks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm going to find you a good suit. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> I think it's possible.
- Its like lets go dads. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Its like the oversized suits. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh God. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It looks so unnatural. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The good old days where just... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why is it that every like 16 year old </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_07> of my friends, or just
complete random strangers </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> out their proms, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> they all look like the T-posing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> they are like, they all like
there's a standing like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yes, we are at a prom. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - A suit it's like 50% the suit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 50% how comfortable
you feel wearing these. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you embody what a suit is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, you can't just
put on a suit and be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess I'm, I guess I'm
kinda like attractive now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No. You've got to believe that
when you put that suit on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm hot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You got to give off that aura. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You got to have faith. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like, okay, there's
always, this there's always like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every time I wear a suit, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's always this countdown of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> when am I going to take this jacket off? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause inevitably when you
go to like any celebrations </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something, you're gonna
get too hot on that side. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Of course.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I feel like, you know,
if you're gonna take pictures </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or do anything get it right at
the beginning of the nights. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because there's nothing more messy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than like just the suit that, you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> has just been battered and damage. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And like you can tell
it's not the suit itself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's the tie, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Its like at the beginning
you're like, you got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> your buttoned up right to the top button. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey gasping for air) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Your tie is tight. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You look fucking suave. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Conner] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Five hours in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> God, you're a sweaty mess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That Tie has taken a beating. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, it's like
halfway down your chest. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One thing, Japan is like
advanced technology and is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that business shirts are like next level. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like I've, I don't
know how they've done it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But Japan is like, optimize
the fuck out of like, shirts. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like business shirt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of course they have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause everyone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everyone's wearing.
- Everyone wearing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Every person here is a salary man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I mean, I put
this thing on at first, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was a little pricey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought, you know, I
mean, I guess, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from buying a nice suit,
I buy a nice shirt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even. I it's always an after thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause I always think if
it's wide, who gives a fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Then I put this thing on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, Whoa, it
breathes, is stretches </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It looks clean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It washes super-easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm like, Whoa, I've
never like appreciated a shirt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I remember, I remember I saw
an ad, for like last summer. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When it was like, you
know that fucking heat wave. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't matter if
it's like 40 degrees </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or it's four degrees. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> People are wearing a suit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The materials feels amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I remember I saw an ad,
which dead are said, like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this business shoulder has
self cooling technology. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I get it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cooling technology. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it's a, it's a piece of cotton. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some of them like
have like a stretchiness </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> to it that makes it like,
feel really like air rated. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay. If you come to Japan, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you like your, your shirts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. Dead ass, you know,
bringing my animate figures </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get some Japanese shirts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> go to like perfect suit factory here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And just go and put, get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> go and get some biceps, self cooling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> They legit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like whenever Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like advertisers as
new fancy technology is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> though it's it's it's hit or miss </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because sometimes you get good things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like the heat tech here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the Heat tech when you go
to Uniqlo and it's winter, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> those are fucking great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The cool shirts, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The cool shirts are obviously great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember though
recently, like Uniqlo also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> released the, they,
you know, this was deep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> during the pandemic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was debriefing during
quarantine and they released </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like their own Arizona masks
or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was meant, that was
meant to like be more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> breathable fabric or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, and it, it got so
high that it's sold out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the first day immediately,
people were queuing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up to buy these masks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think about three months
into it, I was at Uniqlo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and miraculously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were just back on sale day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They just come back into stock. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like, you know what,
I'm gonna give this a try </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because this has been sold out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm tired of my, you
know, of like of my masks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So let's, let's, let's see
how breathable this is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it literally, it literally
felt like you'd just worn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, you know, one of
those like anime knickers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Anime masks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just like underwear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It literally just felt like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you had underwear in your face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was a fucking lie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This thing was this thing, this thing felt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like he was going to give me asthma. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was not breathable at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have a lot of fats they're here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and his fat fad technology wasn't there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like the, a necklace or
something was meant to prevent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Literally I see some people
wearing it's called virus out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like literally just like a
necklace and everyone's wearing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. Hockey made like an
entire video about like a bunch </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of like Corona virus, scam items. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> And one of them was that it's like, it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like this fucking lucky charm
looking thing where it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> "Go away virus." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was literally that energy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like, it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just a car air
freshener around your neck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'd rather you not care </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> than have that and be like I care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Cause, cause like at least </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> you not pretending at that point. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The fact that they're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I saw a bunch of people who like, like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> especially like older, like
women, you know, always believe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in that for some reason
who would like wear that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and be like, Oh, I don't
have to wear a mask anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm I'm fully protected with this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, it's the same
reason anti-vaccine </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like exists. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because this kind of, you know, if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you have a small, small
enough group who trade in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like trade information
within that group, then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're just gonna stop
leaving the wall to sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And you know, it's a lot </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of like the image globally is
that a lot of people, a lot </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of this is confined to America,
but you know, it's all over. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's all over the world. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it is all over the place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as stupidity is not confined by one type </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of like nationality or just
the big difference is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it seems in America,
it's just more documented </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and its more widespread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's unfortunate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause like, I mean like, like you said </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the stupid, I do agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They are stupid, but it's
been like proven, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> If you keep calling them stupid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it like makes them believe in it more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. You're like, you're
like, you're a conspiracy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you working with the government? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're one of them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But also at the same time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't wanna sit there
and humor stupid ideas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. So it's like, yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't, I don't really talk about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't really get involved with it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I'm just like, I feel
like it's a lose, lose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> These people should know about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. You know, I just like
to think that, you know, like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for example, if my mum one day
got into something like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that I'd like to be able to think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I could maybe talk her out of it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like mom. Come on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The PG tips is not poisoned. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You can drink the tea mom. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (joy laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty sure we'd all be dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, just give me a fake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's unfortunate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wasn't it like the England in England? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What? Like the 5G towers caused. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was embarrassing or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Whatever it was, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - That was like huge in the UK. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> The people would like
burning down these towers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's embarrassing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You like, these are like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I live in the same
country with these people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I went to the same schools as these people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> who burned down fucking 5G towers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So that fact of like,
you know, you should </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you shouldn't like when,
when footwear wireless </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like Bluetooth headphones
first came out for your phone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be like, people should
use those because if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're on the phone like
this, then the signal actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. I remember that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And there were people,
at least in Australia, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like when I was growing up, there were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, people dead ass being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> "shit, I have to go buy
some Bluetooth headphones. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know, I don't wanna
get a tumor in my brain </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> from all these phone calls I'm taking." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "what are you on?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think one of the most
interesting things I've like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've seen happen recently </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's happened right in front of my eyes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is the fucking toilet paper shortage. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, like I think back to that and like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why does that feel like 10 years ago? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I think back to that,
unlike our kids are gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> be reading about this or
like, they're gonna see like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> isn't it, they're going to see
the Israeli historian video </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like 20 years in the
future and, and be thinking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like my generation, whenever
this stupid, it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm just imagining like,
you know, 20 years from now </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like our kids, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Will be like in fucking history class </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like modern history being like class. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right so class today
we're gonna be talking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the 2020 great toilet paper shortage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Like it's the same as the crank depression </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Blew my mind. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> How in Japan, it happened as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, we literally have, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It blew my mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> What do you guys clean your ass with? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It blew my mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That happened worldwide. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was literally like a
idea that spread worldwide. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Even though like nobody,
nobody knew where it came from. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's the family in Australia. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Not proud of it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but like, like the thing
is nobody like another </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> countries really knew that
it came from Australia </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> cause they were just
like, Oh, toilet paper. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I must buy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why, but everyone
else is buying toilet people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Therefore I must buy a toilet paper. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It didn't occur to people
that maybe like, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if everyone just keeps using toilet paper </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the same rate that we've all been using </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it it'll continue to be the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause I don't know why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause he was out of every
household necessity that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> think would happen that
you think people would </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> need an apocalypse food, water, I sleep. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Toilet paper. I wake. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> This is the real shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - So what do people think that like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if you got COVID you also
got irritable bowel syndrome. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like , </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - In my mind as well, I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do I really want to be an who just goes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like takes everything in the shop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, I mean, I'll
take like a little bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like pasta a little bit
of canned goods, like enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Like we, like, we
stepped up, but we didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like be like, can I have
everything on that shelf </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> from there to there? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, we, we, we, we only stocked
up just because there was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a literal shortage and there
was a literal point where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I had trouble wiping my
ass because there wasn't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was no toilet paper. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The day gang rise up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - I was gonna clean my
ass by the end of the day, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> but I wasn't gonna step out with a wet ass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like fuck that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I just jiggle a little shake </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> because it was the one piece of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> everyday household equipment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They, you know, you can
understand so, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay. I understand if there
would be a shorter dish soap </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I can understand hand sanitizer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I understand why there
would be food and water </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Food and water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> There wasn't any </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, do you know
how easy it is to live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> off like rice or pasta? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you don't need much of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But there was even a
shortage of like pasta as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I remember. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. I remember, I remember
the video of, I think it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Italy that there was like
all of those supermarkets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the old guy was
like getting pissed off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause there was no pasta
in the supermarket. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was like," people
weren't this obsessed during </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> world war two. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We had more pasta in world war two </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> than we do now, what
the fuck is going on?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess the problem is is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like everyone's telling each other yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You should panic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like in real time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? Spread it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I had a bunch of cop ramen
and I was like, I'm pretty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I'm good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll see what happens. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I'm pretty sure the
stores aren't just gonna shut. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like there would
be an exact point where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would like start panicking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that exact point is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if I found out the company was closed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause like, I, I feel like,
Hey, if the company closes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're going through some real shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That is when I truly woke. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Are we really going through an apocalypse. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay. I wake now. Am fucked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like America, that like waffle house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And like you can judge on
like the disaster based </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on where the wasp waffle
house is open or closed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, it's an actual </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like study like thing where
like, even when there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like hurricanes waffle house
in America is still open. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wow. Seriously? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yes. You should look it up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its really interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like, I think, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> We didn't know which of big
natural disaster it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it must have
Katrina or something else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was still open. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause they're all
equipment like generators. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Right? Why? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> In case of disaster </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The like one of the
only things that like will </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> try their best to stay open. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Unless like, you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> the disaster is so bad when
waffle house in America... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like damn, my
roof just got blown off </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> could kill for some waffles. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like windows and shit are broken. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I think they'd still continue to be open. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like I'll let you in. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I I'm not, I'm not sure exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It could be checking out my ass </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> but this is as far as been there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Cause I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I think what's this entire
situation has made me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> realize is I remember like, Oh,
before, before 2020 watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like old school zombie movies
and something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you'd think to
yourself, man, they made the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they made the people really
stupid in this zombie movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This would never happen in real life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And now I look back and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh its definitely gonna happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like they didn't
make them stupid enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - People that like rounds
up people and feeds them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> to the zombies because
they think it'll probably </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> appease the zombie or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Some shit like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I look at something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like dead rising and I'm like,
well this is unrealistic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> There's still things inside
all of the stores to pay for. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It's still what the there? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Isn't a subgroup </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of people praising the
zombie what's going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I, I am curious for every
like zombie story and like every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like every kind of like apocalyptic story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like would like how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if 2020 would have changed,
like how cliches and tropes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You get a million boring movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about this current pandemic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you make an exciting
movie about the pandemic? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, they tried to do with 2012. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. They made one like
in 2006 or seven were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh it was pandemic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. That was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pandemic. There's like a few movies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like, they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like worryingly close
to like what happened? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. That was the, that
was the one that went viral. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think I saw it last year. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Whereas I was like crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - In the movie there was like a pandemic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was like completely
obviously named something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> completely differently
than the years before. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And, and I think it'd go
viral because people found it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on Netflix and started watching it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And the dead, the plot is that there was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a virus that was started
in China through bats. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. And people like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some chef had it and they
shook hands with a businesswoman </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - And then spread to America. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like half of America died. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think it was mad thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Fucking mad thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I love you right here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - People are like, Oh my God,
this is almost scarily similar </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to what's actually happening right now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Probably smarter because
people probably acted much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot smarter in that movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - In that movie as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> they were just like instantly
die for some reason. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Matt Damon and his kid I think. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Were immune.
- Were immune, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because of course Matt Damon. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm pretty sure if that happened. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Matt Damon and Tom cruise be
fucking immune to anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. Matt, Matt Dame. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think Matt, the, in the movie </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Matt Damon was like, I
quarantine, nevermind. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm immune now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He laid like dead. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I stayed inside of a room for two weeks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then the doctor was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> guess you're immune now
was a pretty good movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you've watched it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've just seen clips of it online </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Contagion. That's pretty good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's pretty fun watching
it now being like, yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It must be, it must be weird watching it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> during the pandemic and
seeing being like, this is a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is uncomfortably close
to what's happening now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It makes you realize
how lucky we got that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It could have been way worse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it could have just
immediately killed people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I think, you know,
we, we've obviously gone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through a really harsh
period right now, but I feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like humanity really just got
like, we got the best warning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So this was, this was
the best warning sign </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we could have gotten. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I say this, obviously
knowing that, you know, it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a tragedy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> how many people have died, but
get the, the scary thing is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that it could have been
so much worse than it was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And this was, this was kind of
like the worst case scenario </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for how easily transmittable
this virus could have been. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But in terms of like, in terms
of like its actual effect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it could have been a lot worse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I say this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with the awful results
we've gotten so far. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - And it's just, it's just
scary to think that, you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if this had happened, you know, 50, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> a hundred years prior, how much? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Probably much, much, much
worse it could have been. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's weird because
like, I I've been thinking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about this a lot because it's, it's been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like a full year now, since,
since I remember thinking, Oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is gonna, this is
gonna last a few months. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - There's this quarantine thing, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> This is a, this is a little,
this is a, I came together. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like, woo, woo bunk
up for like two months. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> And then, you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we'll be able to go outside
and enjoy the summer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The joke was like, Oh, anime nuts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> ha I've found I was born for this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I kind of realized pretty soon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that there's a big difference </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> between choosing to stay home
and being forced to stay home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but there's a big fucking difference. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I saw a tweet that was like, man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> are people going to judge people
who have a time readapting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to social situations. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - What do you mean readapting ? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like people who have been like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> living in the house for too long alone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like, I hope
we don't get judged. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - What they're suddenly gonna
go outside and being like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> how do I interact with you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought it was a little odd. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> What do you think they were like? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Meilyne] I agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You agree?
- You agree Meilyne? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Meilyne] I'm worried. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're worried
- You're worried. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You're the fucking socialite. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] With you... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - You guys aint people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've been in the joint for too long man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I do not have to re acclimate to society. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just like, you know when you
see shit like that on Twitter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> It was just read something </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like it was like, they made it out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like it was way more serious </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and like a big issue than it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, bro, it's
literally talking to people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - What do you, what do you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how is this not second nature to you? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, struggled to
socialize, but acting as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if like your life has just
been flipped upside down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's going to take so much readjusting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like you'd like to get over this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, bro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's not like you're
trying to learn a language </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> that you stopped learning after work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Maybe shouldn't take, I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It could be a shitty take. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I, I was just like, what am I done? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, you're obviously not part of that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Right. There's a hashtag rolling </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know am quite extroverted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I obviously can't sympathize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 100% with introvert problems. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He, he XD hashtag. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But like, you know, I
mean, to me, I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it kind of seemed like they
were trying to make it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause sometimes Twitter
does this where it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guys, guys, I have a problem, guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I need to tell you about my problem guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Please come on. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I, I believe that I
believe that's called first </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> world problems where
it's like, the woe is me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I can, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can kind of understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But at the same time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how is it gonna be diff
like how are you gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how is that much different
from what you were like before? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what's normal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> one's going to force you to
go outside after the pandemic. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> If anything, people are
probably about just go back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to being, we'll just go
back to the situation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> with people who are
choosing to be inside rather </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> than taking a flight, going on a plane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Its like, If you will, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you loved being inside
before the pandemic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you're probably still going to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> inside after the pandemic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's be real. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, it's like the police
aren't gonna come and be like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all right, you've been in
this room for too long. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> All right. Get the fuck out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You gotta, you gotta </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's missed your mouth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> It's been there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you think there are
going to be any big changes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> once this pandemic safe? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Or are we just going to be like, huh? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was a funny thing that
happened last year, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean like in terms of
Japan, like, you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because we're already such a
bomb, Japan, we're going to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stop wearing masks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Now. Why? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Because before, you know,
it was still a socially </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> accepted norm for people
to wear masks, but not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone wore masks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And now I feel like now it's
going to be so deeply ingrained </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the culture that I feel like 90 to 80% </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> of people are just going
to be permanently masks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, you know, like
people already wear masks </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> see you like, you know, during </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially this time of
year where like, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hay fever because you
know that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you have like the influenza season in like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> November where people are
getting sick all the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone's wearing a mask and it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> is your face a little
bit cold, wear a mask? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you know what I'm hoping? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think it's gonna
happen and I'm happy for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> People are gonna take care of the hygiene </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> during conventions. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's a total order. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I am hopeful that a global
pandemic will make nerds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> care more about that hygiene
during a big social gathering. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I, I might, I might be
too hopeful for this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I might be judged for this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel, you know what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel if anything it's
gonna be like, listen, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> we were all not gonna get each other sick. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Now. We've all, we've all gotten the shot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I've been, I've been forced to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> use hand sanitizer and
bathe and wash my hands </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for fuck far too long. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I am gonna go on a bathing strike. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I'd like to just see the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the alcohol stay in front. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. Hand sanitizer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I think if more people would just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially at conventions
where you are shaking hands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> with so many fucking people
and you know, you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe wearing more masks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in convention does that's
not exactly a bad thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because con flu is just an accepted part. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That is an accepted part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> of every convention you
go, you go to, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, it's more like say
here's the one thing I've never </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> understood about con-flu, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like whenever you catch a cold, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's usually from someone. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. Who's the fucker who's
going to a con with a cold? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I mean, I got it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like if, if they booked it, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You've, already paid them off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You've already paid money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You've booked your hotel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Get a cough. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But the least you can do is like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> try and stay as hygienic as possible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is why can we,
can we change this please? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's what am hoping. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm hoping that I go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to the next convention or maybe
like, not just the next one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause obviously the next
one is going to be affected. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But maybe in like three years time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> we still got the same
etiquette of, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> if you know, maybe wearing
masks, isn't such a bad thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Wear a mask, use hand
sanitizer, people having </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> hand sanitizers just like
easily readily available. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like if I'm just like, Oh shit, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> does anyone have any hand sanitizer? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> And like three people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around me just be like,
yeah bro, I got your back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's the positive change. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe, you know, maybe
the smell can change </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but that's fascist hopeful thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can we make those ones
that like wet your hand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to oblivion illegal? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You know the ones when you
get it and it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oil has been dropped on your hand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That shit should be illegal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Where it's like way too sticky. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But it's like sticky. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's it's like, feels like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's been hydrated to like 1000%. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like its fucking weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like why do they keep buying this shit? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Stop making them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the potent, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it really though? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like the feeling of that one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause your hands feel
clean because it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - 10 in a tango one time and now he wants </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Listen, don't knock
it till you try it, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Fingering and tenure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because like, sometimes you get like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you go to a restaurant here
and they're like, please </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> please sign inside your hands. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they give you like
this, they spray it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like the tiniest spray </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on you mentally like make
this tiny spray last, like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like cover your entire, your Palm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> before you can stretch it out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm just like, you know
that picture where it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the door that's
being held by the Cheetos </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> and like the SWAT team
breaking down the door. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I feel is
like, when you think of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like that piddly little spray
on you and you're like, okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can see this does nothing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but you're just doing it
because it's like regulations. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my hand been feel like I've just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> dunked it in like a VAT of oil. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that's what it feels like sometimes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like the feeling
of like, like it's one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it covers your hands and
you can feel it evaporates. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you get like a little
tingly cooling sensation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I rather them go overboard
with the hand sanitizer than </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> under board. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I feel, I feel like
it's clean otherwise it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like fucking sudden.. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know there is my hands
on the cleanest sanitize. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the point of hand sanitizing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> It fucking sanitizes your hand. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's 0. 1% of germs is clinging on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> for dear life on my hands right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just prefer to use
like soap, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Phrase. You can't soap your hands. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You kind of like a restaurant. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You can just be like, all right,
spray a little bit on that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna go to the
toilet and clean my hands. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What?
- What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So much more effort. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah but I like that is
the least optimize thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. Coming from a man who
optimizes everything in his life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Aren't inherently an
optimized experiences so much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Imagine the cue to the toilet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> If that, if that was just
norm, not everyone could be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> large brained like myself, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - shut up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Just shut up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - What you have to do is buy this gel. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> It sanitize your hands. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - More like a strips your skin. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - We gas up a Domus
apparently it is my weekend. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I love it when I could feel my bone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. Cause some people know, some people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> some people just have
like really sweaty hands </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> and it feels like, you know, that spray </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that spray does nothing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Some people need that sweater. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Your hands. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> No, not my hands. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> My hands are like, it's
the one that you handshake </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> at a con it's it's the moisture. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the moist. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He fell to the moist hand for some reason. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The moist hand always cold as fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like you feel the moistness </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> you're literally a cold, wet fish. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> That's all it feels like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> That's what, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - it feels like grabbing like a dead fish. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right. And going to a
supermarket and like seeing one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of those fish in the fish
section, just grabbing it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's what it feels like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It is gross. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you can never shake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> that feeling off after
it's like off your hand. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Apologies to anyone who
has cold wet hands, but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cold hands. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. A sham to shaking their fish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> at home and shaking their fish home. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - How can we talking
about finding Nemo and? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. I mean, I would like to see </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that from future columns,
but I mean, it's really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> it's just a matter, when is the future? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have no interest in
going to digital conventions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't think of a more boring thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just sad to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like they got to keep, they gotta do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But to me, to me, it
doesn't, it doesn't make me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> feel happy that they're
doing digital dimension. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It just makes me feel sad . </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unless I'm staying in
a scuffed hotel room, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's fucked up from
every all everyone's shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's just not the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Its kinda the same as
like virtual concerts. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Like well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that 411 was pretty cool
with like Travis Scott </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> did a whole thing for it though. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's like a different experience </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> different experience
with like someone on zoom </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> just dancing in front of the
webcam being like, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hmm. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Did you see the one that
post Malone did for Pokemon? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> No. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Post-mortem so like Pokemon
just recently announced, Oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well pastor 25th anniversary
this year and post the Pokemon </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the official Pokemon YouTube
channel did a virtual concert </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with post melon and it is weird. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It is weird as fuck. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did Pokemon reach out to post Malone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> or was that what it was like? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was like, literally
like, think of, think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> of like the Travis Scott, the
least family friendly kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of image you could go for
that I expect from Nintendo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> It was this clip on Twitter
that went viral where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like one of the lyrics
to like post Malone song. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like obviously, you know,
like a lot of your songs </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, he swears and
writes, so they censored it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I guess they forgot to send </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to this one line where he was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just the sex though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> The sex though me, while this Lucia flying </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> in the test and learn
rapping, it was like, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So like he, they had like
the, the virtual model </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of post Malone, but again,
it's like an, a Pokemon way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not even it's like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He was kind of halfway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> between a Pokemon model and
just like a regular 3D model. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay. And it was really fucking weird </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and especially weird
because like, when you think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of Pokemon and you think
of modern pop stars </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> post Malone is not the
first person you think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And yet he, yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was really weird just
being like at the end </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> of the concert, he's like,
thank you, Pokemon fans. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I love Pokemon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - How did I not see that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm surprised you guys didn't see it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its like Kanye West
going on the Disney channel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like all these bitches. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're such a fucking whore, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Thank you Disney. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like sometimes you just
see news nowadays and like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> you can't tell if it's
real when you use or just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a meme anymore. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like the real news is the meme. Nowadays. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Sometimes like post Malone and Pokemon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, I like post Malone,
but it was just a very strange </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like, I dunno if I enjoy
the very odd comment combo </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> especially, especially
coming from Nintendo as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> One of was tightening. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, it was, it was good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if you're a post Malone or pear fan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then it was like cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know about like
Pokemon fans, but I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I saw it was like pretty
positively received. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> So I mean good on postmark </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pokemon, AMV to post Malone's music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Like it wasn't a long concert either. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was maybe about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know, like 15, 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Maybe like he played, you
know, he maybe did like three </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or four songs </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - So where could you watch this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> It was on Twitter. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's on the poker. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's on the official
Pokemon YouTube channel. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like if you look up post
Malone, Pokemon concert, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it'll come up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I just want to be in
my room, attending an event. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's just something about the energy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> of having a crowd there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> That's just that, that
you need that energy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It's, it's something
that you can't kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like sadder than a virtual mosh pit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That sounds so depressing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm just imagine what's
the virtual MOSFET. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just Twitch chat going insane. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right? That's a virtual Marsh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, it's the same. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I love Twitch chat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love interacting and I love streaming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the second about it, when
it was supposed to be live. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. In-person when it goes to Twitch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just feels weird or weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even know why
I'm like conventions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I just think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> aren't experience you inherently
just cannot experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, you go to
convention for the people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the atmosphere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Otherwise everyone would be
going on their discord servers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and talking about animating cringey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right? Exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> You go to be cringing and
person meet other cringy people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> It was like the whole reason
why you go to like concerts. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, it's it's of
course to see whoever you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> seeing live, but it's also to
fucking see it with people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's something different
about seeing, you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seeing a bland live as
opposed with other people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> as opposed to seeing it, you
know, listening to the album </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or seeing music videos on my that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> There's just, there's just
an energy you can't capture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're watching it through a screen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I mean, that's, that's why I get why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> people have to do virtual
events and everything </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I'm kind of, I'm kind
of, I just want to attend </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I miss concerts. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I miss crowds. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I never thought I would miss crowds. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause like, I hate crowds
so much, but like even like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's not just even being
there in a crowd, but just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seeing an event and just
hearing that crowd scream </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> there's just something special. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's just something
that brings the hype to it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like I get that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I get that like the most
recent, like the most </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> recent event I can think of
is a league of legends worlds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. Normally I'm like
super, super hype for worlds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause as you would be for
any other sporting events </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there was just something
about seeing this game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> play that just didn't have
the crowd role behind it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> That just made it feel like
you were just watching a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Thailand one stream or
something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like watching an online tournament. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. I remember the players,
they were saying as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like, yeah, it's
not the same without a crowd. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, of course you get a win. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, when the crowd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - When someone makes a amazing play </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and you hear the roar,
there's just something special </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That even though I'm not there in person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I've, I've been to,
you know, I've been there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in person and the energy
there is fucking incredible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But even just capturing a bit
of that energy and putting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, just hearing that
crowd scream it's it's, it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's something that can't be replicated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like I know, and I
the I think it was China </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that tried adding like that
tried the cans laughter effect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they, they, they
added fake crowds attacks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. So what to the legal legends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I heard like, someone's
probably going to fact check </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and call me out on this,
but I think I heard that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that just sound... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wouldn't be surprised </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That sounds even
worse ,if they did that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just the Friends fucking
like soundtrack starts playing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> A sound base just comes in like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Because like, I remember like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, cause February
just passed and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love watching like the swimmer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the Sumo season is
like during the winter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. So just finished,
but like, of course </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's a pandemic,
you can't have people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the tiny, you know,
stadium watching the Summa. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was really sad to see
this like massive Sumo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stadium only having maybe
like four people in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's just like, and you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously after every wind, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Usually the crowd, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like claps or like cheers or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But instead it's like, someone
does this like Epic win </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and like three people are clapping. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It just sounds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a cow just feels
like the zero stakes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. If you can't hear anyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. It was really
interesting because the swimmer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> they were all wearing masks
before they got on stage. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It it's just funny seeing
them like, all right, we have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we have these precautions,
they take their masks off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> they step up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and immediately just
put that faces together. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know about this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> socially distanced. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. I'm just like,
you know, you pick one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is funny how crowds can
play into sporting event hype </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I, so I've been
recommended a lot of, like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> since we did the chess
tournament, I've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like rec been recommended
way more chess clips </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and been watching my chest streamers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Hikaru and everything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And there's just like,
there's just something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> about the image of had about
chess before that was boring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel a big part </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of that was just how bored everyone looks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in any big chess crowds. Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, it's like people
playing a chess till one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> during a coughing, coughing events </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and whatever, whatever, what I realized. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like one thing I've realized </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about how we could like have the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the image could be easily changed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was always recommended this
other events, like clips </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of this other event
where it's just a bunch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of grandmasters who went,
who are just like shooting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shooting shit and having fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they weren't like
having team tournament's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just like, and like
trash talking each other. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, dude, this
seems like legit fun events. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And this, this could have easily
changed the image of chess </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which I think it's great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Now that the image of chess is
being like slightly changed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I no, no, not everyone will
agree with you Garnt there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, that's, that's my opinion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> as a filthy casual chest player. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - GM tweeted out being like, man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's such a shame that chess
is going in this direction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And then everyone was just
like not serious direction </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because know chess is a
lot of history behind it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And there's a lot of people
who are like, it's, it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know, it's, it's big
brain, it's intelligent </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's being watered
down for these common folk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, you are, you
are like an ex you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> you've played chess for your country </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> but how do you feel about it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it doesn't really seem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like you had that like purist view on it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause like I hated it because
like when I was doing it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was a bunch of, you
know, 60 year old white men </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who would just be in charge
of everything and they talked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you were like the night's God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Culture like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Cause they, you know,
it was taken very seriously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the UK and the history
behind it is like very long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know, whatnot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you know, I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, you know, if, if, if the sports </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> you know, wants to have more
funding and be more popular, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think it's a good thing
people get into chess. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, yeah it's a good game. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think that it's, you know,
one of the, probably the bad </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> better games your kid can get into. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. I mean, it's kind of
evolved to get with the times. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. And pure always. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, unfortunately
chess is probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> on its own, a bit boring. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. Let's be honest. Right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like I play it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I could say that, but I think, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> adding these tournaments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that don't really take away anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from the pro scene, you
know, if it gets yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, if you look at
chess viewership on Twitch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, outside of like Polk
champs and stuff like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the big chest dreamers
viewership has grown a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - How many street, how many
viewers does he carry again? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - 25k. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's, it's fucking great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because before you literally
could not make money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> play like playing chess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So many big chest streamers now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah. And it's really Epic, Epic wine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Its pretty epic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there's room for like many chess streams </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to make a living off this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and stream it and you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and it makes sense. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's really taught
me how important images </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in regards to like a
sports and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Because you have to, you know,
there's, there's, there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, you've got to respect the legacy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the history and stuff
like that, but you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to a point where it's a
modernized, it needs to modernize. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And these catch up with the times and I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's great because I've gotten way more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into chess simply because
it just, it just looks fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It looks way more fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, there's like,
like stuff like, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone thinks of sports,
like rules don't change. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. Like rules, like secret </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like stuff like basketball </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm pretty sure that the
NBA changes the rules </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> have changed the rules a few times based </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on what makes us more
fun viewing experiences. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. So it begs the question is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like what's more important
the sport or the audience? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. And so I think chess is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at that crossroads where
there's obviously people who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> have been training their whole
life to be pros and whatnot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And obviously, yeah, it sucks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that maybe your sport
is a little less serious </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but on the other hand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you have way more opportunities,
way more money, you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> way more chance to have a
platform and do whatever you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and be on the sidelines
being salty about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> You're probably going to
be the one left behind. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It's, it's, it's a
balance at the end of the day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Right. You can't go too
far in either direction. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel, I, I feel that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I remember when he carried got signed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> up for TSM and I was just
like, Holy shit, this is cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is a park. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That is a like, like just,
just like imagine, imagine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> if we had a chess tournament
where people showed up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in like e-sports gowns and
e-sports shots and stuff </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> like that, that would be
pretty high for my opinion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But obviously I'm a
filthy casual don't play. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't play chess out of
anything, but just casually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So that's, that's just my opinion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I totally forgot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I played in chess tournament. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like last week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I totally forgot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. It was fine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I had like one hour
sleep, so it's pretty brutal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I had to film, like I have
to go to somebody's phone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, you say that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but you're like, no,
knowing your schedule. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I kind of like, I was like kind of you are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> you're a Dick to apex back then. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. Still kind of did it to yourself. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh I did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just, you don't you
just say yes to something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're like, you don't
really think about like how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it will actually fit into your schedule. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just sounds cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Until it happens. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. So I got invited to
Twitch Rivals, which was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they wanted to do like a chess tournament </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you get padded
like a GM or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and they tell you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which piece to move and
you have to choose which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of that piece. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> If they say pawn, you
choose which of the eight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Pawns to move. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Right. And so it's pretty fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I haven't played chess
since our tournament. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. So I was pretty
rusty and I'll see, not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> having much sleep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it was good fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like doing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like playing chess, but
it's really annoying how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like there's some comments
as well that like bro Cornell </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wasn't it kind of in play for? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like when he was a kid, that's a lie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> He says now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, bro, if you didn't play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> for like seven years and
you played now, I bet </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you probably wouldn't be out of that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You haven't heard of a gap? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. And also I think I'm
pretty like the same level </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> or pretty better as a child than I am now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. We had to say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, it's the same logic. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like all you want
the quadratic equation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> during school and you can't do it now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You didn't learn it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's also like, people
think like, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how good do you think that like 12 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 11 year olds are at this game? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, there's some exceptions of amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - There was so many Magnus castles </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> right? Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was like, bro, I was
like the worst on my team. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Just sneaked in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I remember when I was
talking about, you know, my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my masters and I was like, explain to you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I couldn't remember what
equation I was talking about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It was second order
differential equations. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember that now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I kind of says, is it
integral you're thinking of? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I guess I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I guess I was thinking integer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I should know too as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause I also have it in
engineering department. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there was so many comments like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnts wouldn't have written , </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Garnt didn't pass his masters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Couldn't even remember that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you don't use something,
surprisingly you forget it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. You'll have to understand that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> A lot of times during this podcast </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a lot of us are just brain dead. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We're just, we're just chatting. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - You know, it's the whole
vibe of the show where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> we just talk, we don't
really plan anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> None of the topics ever
planned beforehand, we just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> we just kind of shoot the shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We didn't plan to go into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the monsters topics of engineering. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I applied for an engineering
job, I'm more qualified </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> than someone who is like,
hasn't got the degree </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but might be studying that thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He probably knows more than
me at this current time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But because I haven't done
anything for like three years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Fuck I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Forget, you forget
it, forgot everything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - I finally understand it at the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but that's the thing I feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like now I finally understand how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like my parents felt when
I would like go to them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and being like, can you help
me with this math equation? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, you, you
finished school. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You've done this before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And my parents were like, I
don't know how to do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You don't know how you did this in school? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think, I can't even remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> like having passed my
master's in engineering. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I probably can't remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> how to do basic trigonometry now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude if someone came </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> with like some 10 year old
came up to me and was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> can you help me solve this
long division equation? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I'd be like fuck. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know how the fuck to do this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd probably research real quick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Am sure I can get the answer to you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let me Google it real quick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Like I totally get that now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because I remember
as a kid, you're just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "how can you not know this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're an adult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, everything you
learned this before." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know how see the
fucking like Facebook quizzes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that pop up, they're like you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it'd be like different tanks of water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It'll be like, which
one will fill up first. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But that was like, literally
like part of my fluids exam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> We had stuff like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> back in the day I'm sure
I can answer that too. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But right now I got no fucking idea </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I don't remember what
the fuck it was all about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> All right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, I guess we have nothing else to talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about today, boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So handed off to you, the host Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or we just, we just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't remember how we ended up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm satisfied. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've seen enough Trash Taste time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Am satisfied. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To the patreons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've talked enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm satisfied. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Hello patreons. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Thank you for being a patreon. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> - I just feel like Joey
does it so much better </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than either of us, because he's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like ingrained that
into, up into his head. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I literally just like mentally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I just like press a button on a place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just choose not to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, Joey does it for me
every time and I'm just laying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I just, just let,
just let Joey don't do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hey man don't fix something
that isn't broken, you know? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes. Do everything that Joey says. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> And did, you mentioned </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> that we have a Twitch channel as well? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We haven't mentioned that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We have a third channel now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Trash Taste After Dark. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It used to be unofficial. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And now it's official. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I know that confused a lot of people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's, it's very, it's very confusing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because there are some
channels out there that aren't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> official and there are
some channels out there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that are official. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, we were like, let's
set the record straight. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> We have three channels. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We have this one that you're currently on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> We have Trash Taste Highlights </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and we have Trash Taste After Dark. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Anything else is unofficial. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Where we will be
uploading our Twitch stream. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Basically after dark is literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just a VOD of outage, Twitch streams. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - You know, there might
be other like, you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> bullshit content as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But for the time being
all of the Twitch Fords. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh yeah, by the way, follow
us on Twitter as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> At Trash Taste podcast, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we'll be doing like semi-regular string. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> We have some stream ideas, no
promises, but it's just there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just follow us there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anyway. That's it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Connor has been very tied today. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I was good the first hour. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I'm just like, bro hit me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is, this is how I've
seen you for the past week. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Kinda of has been addicted to
apex for like the past month. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And every time I see him,
he doesn't just do himself. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Every time I see him, he </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he just comes in and be like, guys </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I was streaming till like 4:00 a.m. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wasn't streaming yesterday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just tired. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing loudly) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Most of the time he doesn't even stream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> He just plays and I'm just like fine. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Anyway, that's it from us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So we'll see you guys next time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [All Three] Bye. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (bright upbeat music) </SPEAKER_04>
