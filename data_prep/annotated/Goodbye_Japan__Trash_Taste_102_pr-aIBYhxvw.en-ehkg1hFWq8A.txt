<SPEAKER_05> - Hombres? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I gotta think of saying ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hombre! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hombre? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that the correct pronunciation? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I just love saying it like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like saying "Jose"
instead of "Ho-se." You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jose! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Spanish language is quaking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Josie! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So the Pitbull album, right? </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> - Dale? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dale. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dale, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, jala-peno. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh god, okay, that one ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jala-peno. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, that one I actually kinda ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jala-peno. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jala-penos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But yeah, I am hombre number one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with hombre number two and three, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Connor and Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hey! We're the hombres. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hello. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're the hombres-
- For today. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you've just been clickbaited, baby! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're not leaving Japan! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, no, you haven't been clickbaited, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because we are leaving Japan! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] True. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Technically. In a sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> In a sense.
- Technically speaking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you leave Japan and come
back, you still left Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This just sounds dramatic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you weren't clickbaited. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You were just tricked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, don't say that Joey! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You weren't tricked. You
weren't tricked either! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's true as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's dramatic, we're just being dramatic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We may be over-drama ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, we just dramatized it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We didn't over-dramatize it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not overly dramatized. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're at a party, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> instead of individually going around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being like, "I'm heading off
now, I'll see you guys later." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's going, "Guys, I'm leaving!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And then walking out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I am not returning for
a considerable amount of time! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, which is basically
what every YouTuber does! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, when someone says, "I'm leaving," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> YouTube or something, it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, someone's burnt out and needs a break. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I get it, I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You need one more like, YouTuber video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> gain the clicks before
you go on your holiday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course. So this is that
YouTube video for Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, yeah, we'll
explain why in a second, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but like, can I, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna make a quick announcement. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For myself, if you would let me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I started my own clothing brand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, did you actually? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm wearing it right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Oh fuck yeah! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was gonna ask, I was
like ... what is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, yeah, I've been working
on this for like, a year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Okay, nice! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In secret. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh nice! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one knows about it. Until now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like they didn't know about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, oh, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So yeah, by the time
this episode comes out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it will be like, pretty
much close to launch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I figured while we're here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll just announce it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Building up hype. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Building up hype. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nice, nice, nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's the brand called? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's called Nonsense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I was gonna ask if it's
called Fuck That Noise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not called Fuck The Noise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So this is just one of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Actually, Kai, can you go upstairs and get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the other shirt I have? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, so ... </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> - I got it, I got it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, I figured, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this would be the perfect
opportunity to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> announce it, since you
guys don't know about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I have another shirt here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What made you decide to start
working on a clothing brand? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like drip! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know? And it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a lot of drip I like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there's a lot of drip I like wearing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what better way to flaunt out my drip </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than to just make my own drip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Just make ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so this is ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey's literally went,
"I'll do it myself!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll do it myself! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So this is the long tee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Right. That looks sick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Ooh, that looks nice! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Back design's like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ooh!

<SPEAKER_05> But yeah! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Damn.

<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Business mogul. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> - Business starter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You gonna put it in

<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah yeah. Yeah of course, I have to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Startup.
- Don't do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nonsense founder. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I have to do that! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nonsense founder and CEO! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But yeah, so I've been
working on this brand thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for like a year now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Great pitch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was ... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I did not mean for that to
be that loud. I'm so sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] But yeah, I've been
working on this for like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a year now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you know like, I've
always been known to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, wear good clothes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like, I like you know, fashion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] I'm privileged. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] I'm privileged. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm privileged to wear good clothes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But you know, I've always been like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interested in like clothing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like fashion and
streetwear, stuff like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I was like ... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's so much good
streetwear out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Mhmm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like, nothing that was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really like speaking to
me, personally, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, there's a lot
of good brands and whatnot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's like, so I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll fuckin' do it myself! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll make it ... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was it a pain in the ass? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah! Absolutely it
was a pain in the ass! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I haven't done it, so I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so it's like a full
on proper brand or anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and like, the one thing
I was always scared of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right, is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever YouTubers release clothes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's usually under the
merch umbrella, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like, I didn't
want this to be merch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's like, 'cause you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these designs, and like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the designs we're gonna be releasing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have nothing to do with me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like the likeness of
me or anything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I want it to just be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something separate to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That like, in the case that like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the anime man or whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just fucking implodes in on itself, right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a couple years time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that this can still be around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So it's like, I'm
already not watching anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly! It's already on
the dire straits, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm gonna plan a backup. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's already on the dire
straits so I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I'll try something new. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll try something, like, challenging. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So by the time this episode is out, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all the social media stuff
is probably ready to go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We literally didn't know
anything about this, by the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We didn't know anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is, you do not
understand how hard it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to keep it a secret from these guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, Joey's kept
a secret from us boys? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> What's going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like literally I started this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> before we moved to this office. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you serious? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like at the old office. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What?
- Wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's been like, over a year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fucking hell! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That I've been working on this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So yeah, I'm very passionate about this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I want it to do well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I hope you guys like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have so many questions! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know where to start. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's all, everything is
designed by me as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, all sketched by me and everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I obviously got designers and everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like, clean it up and everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like, all the designs are done by me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, I hope people like it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so check out Nonsense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're gonna be doing this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where we release a new design every month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - One new design a month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I thought like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> originally I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> should I do like the usual
thing where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, I drop, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a collection, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a summer collection
or a winter collection. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I was like, nah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm selling it to people on the internet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and the people on the internet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have the fucking attention
span of a goldfish, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I'm like, let's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> keep bringing stuff out, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Keep the drip dripping. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly! Keep that
tap just slightly open </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so that the water's just
constantly dripping, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Rather than keeping it closed
and then suddenly being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Here you go!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So yeah, that's the plans for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Obviously I'm not like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking quitting anything else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is just like another thing
I'm doing on the side, so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Hey, if you like it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> then check it out, I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And then hopefully
preorders will start soon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was there anything that
was surprisingly difficult </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> while making your own clothing brand? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> That caught you off guard? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like, well for one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> everything's designed by me, but like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't do like graphic design. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or you know like, I can't do like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> logo design and stuff like that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like, even just coming up with like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, just like the
font and stuff like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for Nonsense, and like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if the logo is anywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, yeah, like you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just something like that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like even just coming up with like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that font, took me like two months. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well that's why graphic
designers are like, a job, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I basically just described
what a graphic designer is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're like, damn, this shit hard! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> There already a job? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> There already a job for this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah! Right, because like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not used to that with
like video creating, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, usually it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> nine times out of 10, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think of an idea, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I try and make it work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then whatever I have, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to work with, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Especially with the
kind of content I make. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if it's not like, perfect perfect, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to get something out there, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Otherwise I won't, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll have the fuckin' upload schedule of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, 2015 Garnt, essentially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's like, but like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with this, I have to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really be careful with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I don't wanna
get a design out there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it just looks like shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know? Because it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> my brand is on the line, essentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - How many fonts did
you have to go through? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Uh, like ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well I mean, for one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like the actual, the
official font for the brand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is completely custom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I had to get like a typographer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not a graphic designer, a typographer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I had to find a typographer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like, and like a font specialist, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to be like, "Here's the brand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Here's what the brand is about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Here's the kind of designs I want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Can you come up with just
like, a shitload of fonts?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we literally went
through about 100 fonts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and just decided, that's the one we want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because the thing about fonts is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's something that, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> most people don't really
appreciate or think about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Until you have to choose one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I remember like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just having to choose one
just to use for my like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my YouTube videos, or just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - A logo or something, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where the fuck do I even start? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you go through like
the Photoshop like, font, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you like realize ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just Calibri, innit? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just Light Arial. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you talk to graph- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sans serif? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. And then you
talk to graphic designers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're just like, they're
just like built different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They see a font and they
can like, name the font. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. They can name the font, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they can name like, the
exact kerning between like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> each of the fonts.
- Yeah, I know right! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're like, "That's like
an eight kerning right there." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, what the fuck is all this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't even know what that means. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kerning is like the
space between letters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like, I got like a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, working with like
a typographer and everything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like I gained like a whole
new appreciation for like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> graphic design and
typography, 'cause like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that shit's hard as fuck! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I can see why! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know like, in the case of
like this for example, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just changing the spacing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the kerning between each of the letters, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> makes like a completely different design. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you wouldn't
think otherwise, though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you make like a
YouTube thumbnail, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, just fucking put the font there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're good! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- Right, kinda thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's like, it made me appreciate like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> subtle design. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I'm kinda going with like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of a combination between like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> streetwear but also loungewear. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So like, you can wear this like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> outside of course, and
you know, it'd be great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you can also, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's comfortable enough
where you can wear it inside. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - As well, so for you weebs out there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that don't go outside,
you can still wear it! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is like the longest
Trash Taste ad we've ever done. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is an ad that's
not an ad that is an ad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not an ad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I'm sponsoring myself right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah no, because like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, talking about like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fonts and having to
choose fonts and just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being thrown into a world that you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't understand sometimes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you never knew that, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there was this much thought into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I remember like recently, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is like going off on a tangent, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I remember recently, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've just got like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had like a binge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Not really a binge, but just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had my recommended taken over by these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really weird keyboard ASMR videos? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, I don't know if you guys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know what I'm talking about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I've seen a
couple of them, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know what you're talking about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because how I basically discovered it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was just this random
keyboard video, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was just like, why
is there a keyboard video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of just someone typing on my timeline? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I click on it, just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I think the video title was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Just listen to the
sound of this keyboard," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like that, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it was just like him, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like, him or her, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like just pressing the keys, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And just, and the title was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Just listen to the space bar," right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's pressing the keys, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you go to the space bar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it just sounded like a space bar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "It's just a space bar!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I go to the comments section </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be like, "What's going on?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And all of the comments were just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I was having a nice time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> until you pressed the space bar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I vomited." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the vomit emotes or something like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never been put into a world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I just did not understand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I mean like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I kinda felt that when, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was Connor, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Who got like, I think one
of your fans made like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a custom keyboard for Connor, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then they also, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the custom keyboard,
which looked sick as fuck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> there was also this like,
other smaller keyboard, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you could test out ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, that was Garnt's.
- Oh, that was me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, that was Garnt? Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where it was like a smaller keyboard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where you could test out all
the different types of keys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like hammers, and I was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what's the difference? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> They are, like, I touched all
of them and I was like ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Half of these sound the fucking same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think they, as
someone who's like using </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the expensive keyboards, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause, only 'cause it was given to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would never have gone out
my way and paid that much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To me it was all the same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now I get it 'cause I use it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Before I didn't understand
what the difference was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But I really like the smoothness, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like the subtle clicks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, now that I've watched ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a very slight click,
but it's really nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, now that I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 20 keyboard videos down, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I kinda get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> There's like a nice ... there's like ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like the thonk sound, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the thonk sound where it's ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you though? Or have you just been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> conditioned to understand it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe I've just been conditioned! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Listen, I'm one of you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Cherry MX Brown Switches can
suck my dick, there you go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Welcome keyboard enthusiasts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I'm like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The cherry switches,
I can actually tell, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they fucking suck now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I used to have it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was it, wait, like why? Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It sounds like a car crashing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every time you fucking press it in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so goddamn loud and clicky. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, you mean like the clicky one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Super super clicky one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, fuck those ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck, they, like I had one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in my old office in the UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and since I went back to
the UK, I like, I had it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's probably the
Cherry Brown MX switches. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're like the cheapest ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's like the
Cherry Blue MX switches. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh okay okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The Gatreon ones? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The Gatreon is like,
Gatreon's where it's at, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've got the Gatreon Black Ink ones. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, that's a good one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's a good one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And like, it's like,
oh it's fucking good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's fucking good, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I really like the Gatreon, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> milk yellow, I believe? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's literally called something milk, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it like, it just has this like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> nice little thonk to it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's nice, it's like ASMR, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So just, it's so smooth, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's so, it's milky! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like milky! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just sounds like (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The guy ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck are you talking about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He told me like what lube he used. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like ... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't need to know
what you jacked off with, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I mean I appreciate it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so to explain, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like I'm also getting
a custom keyboard made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because a fan messaged me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But I like ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude, I mean like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I did pay for this thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so he was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, do you wanna get a
keyboard made for you?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's in the process of being made. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was just like, "Yeah, sure!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Thinking that he was just going, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he was just going to send
something that he recommended. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he was like, "No, we're
gonna do the entire process." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like what kinda keyboard do you want? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you want like a
100%? Do you want a 75%? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you want like a 50%? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "What? You are saying numbers right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a keyboard. What
are you talking about?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll have a full 100% keyboard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I want a keyboard, and
I want every part there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, why would I only
need 75% of the keyboard? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Gimme the whole thing! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't like the number pad
and all that shit on the side. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I used to not care, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but now that I have a keyboard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that doesn't have a number pad, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I understand why it's
unnecessary to have it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I realized until it was gone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I never fucking used it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know some people
who like, go ham on it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, good for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, good for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But I'm out here, I'm totally
fine with the top thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Also, I just wanna save room! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I use the number pad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Mostly because when you ... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right Boomer.
- Huh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right Boomer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just ... mostly, it's useful, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's, all the numbers
are just close together! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I agree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I recognize it's the superior
way to handle numbers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is. It is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I just (indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - With the amount of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> two factor authentication I have, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I'm constantly using it! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not that long! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is! It is! It is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This ... there you go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Although, I definitely
had a moment where like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, I should probably
start using the number pad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on my old keyboard, because it's there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then I had a moment
where I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Damn, it's so hard to
use with my left hand." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was just like
doing this and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, maybe I should just
take my hand off the mouse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just do this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I thought you were like ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, oh, why is
it not on the left side? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It'd be so much easier! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then I was like, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could just let go of the mouse, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and perhaps just do this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought you were implying like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> your right hand was like,
on your dick or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh, like jacking off? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're like jacking off and you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) my credit card details. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I'm like, jacking
off while like, playing Run. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like just ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, if you're like an
accountant or something, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You gotta be pressing numbers all day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then it obviously makes sense.
- True, true! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, for normal guys ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, I should be used
to that layout as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> every calculator is that layout, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's like, why is it
so hard for me to use </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's on a keyboard? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even though on a calculator it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> basically second nature. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the reason I like the number pad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is because buying a lot of things online </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you gotta enter your
credit card number a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Log into your bank account details. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How much shit are you buying? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is like, actually
beneficial to have that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> real estate taken up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Um, like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, I just have enough ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like I use it a lot, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because sometimes I need to
log into my bank, and you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're entering purely just numbers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's not like a password, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's when the number pad is useful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, when you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> entering the numbers on a line- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Marginally, though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Marginally useful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mr. Optimization! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought you'd be one of me, man! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought you'd be one of me! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Listen, you're trying to
optimize two things at once. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How fast can you type stuff in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but also the space in your desk, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got a lot of like, shit on my desk, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you know, 'cause I got like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> god knows how many, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got like two audio interfaces. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I got a bunch of other cables. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I will admit, the aesthetic looks better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> without the number pad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's, the aesthetic
looks better, but ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also, travels easier. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, tryna put a number, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can put like a, what are they called? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Are they 75%? Half keyboards? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 75%, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 75% keyboard, you can
put that in a backpack. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't put a full one in your bag. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's too big. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why would you ... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes you're going somewhere, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean you're going to a
LAN event or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Not that I do anymore, but. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - When was the last time
you went to a LAN event? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - University. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was like high school for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But also like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what if you don't like the
keyboard on your laptop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get it, 'cause sometimes
the laptop keyboards suck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you wanna bring one with you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're gonna be like,
having your remote setup. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Packing like a full size
keyboard in a backpack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never been that desperate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never been like,
every time I've touched the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> laptop keyboard ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't realize how good having like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> things smaller and
taking up less space is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah but like, it's not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like my laptop keyboard isn't
so fucking detrimental to me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I'm like, "I gotta
pack another keyboard!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You know? Like ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's about the ergonomics! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You are saying that you'd
rather pack a keyboard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without a number pad than
just use the laptop keyboard? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That makes less sense! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That makes less sense! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No it doesn't! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is the opposite of optimization! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're taking up more space now! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You're taking up more space! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I'm having like
a remote setup, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm going to a place,
I'm gonna be streaming, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna be playing games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna play games
on the laptop keyboard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just bring a controller! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can bring a controller, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but some games don't use controllers! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well then don't play those games! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, well, but I wanna
play these games, Joe! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You're just being pedantic
now for no reason! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just play a game that
you can use the controller! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know for a fact I'm not alone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen people do this so many times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> People don't wanna use the
fucking keyboard on the laptop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like eight hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure you're not alone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's so many people who do this! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> This is not weird! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never gotten to
the point where, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have a remote setup, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A remote setup is not like
your permanent setup, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But if I really really
really need a keyboard, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd just buy like a fucking
five dollar keyboard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or something like that, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, it's ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, 'cause then you may
as well use the laptop one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what I'm saying? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, no, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if I really really
wanted like a remote ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like a remote setup, but like ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just about the
ergonomics, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like using a laptop keyboard for hours, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like actually fucking hurts your wrists. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Using a keyboard for
hours hurts my wrists. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's why I try and use a
controller for every game! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like a nice keyboard, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, good ergonomics, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't hurt your wrists. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] You bring the rest as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You got the rest too? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Laptops don't have rests! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, my laptop, it's amazing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But I have to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just, there's no support or anything, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just putting my hand ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll just bring the fucking rest then! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just feel like ... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean you gotta put it down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on like the fucking trackpad and shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's kind of in the way,
it's kind of annoying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, it just doesn't
work! It doesn't work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just feel like the entire point ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank god someone in the
office understands this point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just think like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the whole point of a
laptop is to be portable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it is! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, and ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - But what's? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - At that point you might as well just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> bring a monitor as well! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But if the keyboard fits
in the bag, it's portable! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you can't bring a (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The reason why a laptop's portable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is 'cause it's not a giant fucking case, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> not 'cause the keyboard is like, on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like, one of the reasons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I'm whipping it out in a cafe, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, I'm gonna use the laptop keyboard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm replying to emails,
it's not a big deal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I'm streaming or gaming,
I want a fucking keyboard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - But in, how are you like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're at the point where you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bringing a portable setup, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Of like, in which, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tell me this hypothetical situation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you need to set up
an entire stream setup. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I'll tell you, it's
not just a fucking laptop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you need to bring. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you're bringing your
entire fucking stream setup, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how much are you bringing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, what are you bringing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, when I went to the UK last time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I brought it with me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You know? You just bring, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause if I wanna film some anyway, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd bring a camera, anyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The camera has two uses. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can film other stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you bring lights? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I don't bring lights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't need lights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, you can figure out lighting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not a big issue. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just having a good
camera, a good mic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then if you wanna play games or shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you bring a keyboard and a mouse! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're not gonna fucking
use the trackpad, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, you're not gonna use the trackpad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] You're not gonna
use the trackpad, but ... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A trackpad is like, totally
different than a mouse, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right right, but I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you have a 75% keyboard,
it's not that big. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - But then like, another thing is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are you still gaming on the laptop, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or do you have like a monitor
that you're using as well? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - On the laptop's fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The screen I have on my
laptop's pretty good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well that's not very ergonomic, is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course it is! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause you're fucking going like this! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No dude! My desk's over there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my other keyboard's here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this one's there, it's further away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause just, I have more room now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause the keyboard's
not attached to the thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I can place the
screen where I want it to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it is ergonomic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it me or does this
just sound very pretentious? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, this is not! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> This is, if I wanna like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do a fucking setup! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you wanna go portability, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why not go for a 50% keyboard then? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Or? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - A 50%? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Or a 25. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or 30%. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't even know
what 50%, what is a 50%? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> How can you remove less? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is ... you would be surprised! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You would be surprised, okay? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - What are we removing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Man] Smaller keys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Smaller keys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well no, I won't be able to press it! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I already have fat fingers, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I need to like ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why don't you just invent
a keyboard which is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the space bar and the arrow keys? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't, who uses the arrow keys? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, if you're playing
games on a keyboard ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - WASD, dude! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, or WASD. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want all the letters! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I gotta fucking type! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, use the fucking laptop typing! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] So the thing with 50% boards, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't have like the numbers on top. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right right.
- Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think gaming you need the numbers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] Yeah, you need the numbers! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, it is really not that hard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to bring a 75% keyboard in
your bag or in your suitcase. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's also not hard to just
bring a fucking controller. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like half of a pizza box! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like not even, it's tiny! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It doesn't take up room! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And your clothes are the padding! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This isn't hard! Why is
this so crazy to you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like I'm bringing a fucking like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pet dog in my bag. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is this so unbelievable? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It just sounds- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's just like, at that point, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at that point where you are bringing ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, at that point where you're
bringing a streaming setup, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a number pad is not that
much more surface area. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but what I'm saying is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's just unnecessary. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like in general. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like in any keyboard setup. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just put the fucking
keyboard in your checkin! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Technically if you get a 50% keyboard, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're removing unnecessary
keys, right? You know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the entire ... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No it's not! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 75% is like the perfect key experience! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's called a preference, Connor! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's called a preference, okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay look, I would argue, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The reason why 75% is no
different from the 100% </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is 'cause you don't lose anything, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You just have numbers twice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't need numbers twice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just need numbers once! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> This is not, why is this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you're saying like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> removing the second number pad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is not equal to being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Get rid of half of the alphabet!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is not the fucking same at all! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't believe this is
an argument you're making! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] Imagine in a hotel
you're stuck for a week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah yeah! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Man] You want the TV screen
to be your second monitor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You leave your laptop there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and you can sit at your
bed with your wireless 75%. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah! Every hotel,
every Airbnb has a TV! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do not pack a keyboard wherever I go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's fine! But why
are you clowning on me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is not like a clown thing to do! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is a normal thing! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just sounds incredibly
pretentious and tedious to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - How is it pretentious? What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I wanna bring a keyboard? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let me just get my 75% keyboard out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No no no, because
everyone works differently! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I can't go to a Starbucks and work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like that's not, I'd be like, why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so pretentious, Garnt, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you go to a Starbucks to
type, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, just work from home. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Specifically a Starbucks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Specifically! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, I don't see how
this is pretentious! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm losing my mind over this argument. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No no, it's the way that
you're framing it as like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "This is the superior way to type. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the only keyboard that works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Number pads, irrelevant. Unnecessary." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they are unnecessary! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Number pads fell off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All I'm saying is, you
have your preference, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like using a number pad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because I use it enough functionally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> for me to be able to justify that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is a convenience for me! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> All right? I like number pads! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, but how did this
get to me being clowned on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> for bringing keyboards with a laptop? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> How did this get ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's Trash Taste, baby! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's not the reason you
were clowning on me, Garnt! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The reason you were tryna clown on me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is 'cause I brought a keyboard places. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause it's funny, that's why! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a lot, okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, there is ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I understand it's a preference, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I understand it is a preference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you want to bring your keyboard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you never thought like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> when you were like, trying to play games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> aren't you like, "Why are my hands </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so fucking close to the screen?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Because here's the thing, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really ... I'm not a gamer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah! You have to
understand, we're not gamers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> We're not gamers like you! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So why don't you just say
that in the first place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> instead of pretending like you were? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never pretended like I was! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I told you what I'm
using the keyboard for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you're like, "No,
that doesn't make sense." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well you're streaming, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I also have a portable streaming setup, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I just don't need a keyboard for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think to myself, "I
can't game without this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I am a (indistinct)
in League of Legends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have a 1% keyboard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the R key, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's, like you know, like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just, like if I need to
game while I'm out and about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just bring a fucking controller </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just play games that use a controller. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah but like, what if someone's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, do you wanna, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you've arranged a game with someone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The game doesn't have a controller. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then I'll use the keyboard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not gonna fuckin'
have a hissy fit over it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and be like, "Where's my 75%?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wouldn't have a hissy fit! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I would have
brought it fucking with me! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So there wouldn't have been a hissy fit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but what if you didn't? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I always bring it with me! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not happening- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's just a waste of space! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not a waste of space! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's fit, it's small! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> How is a keyboard a waste of space? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, I've ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Always fucking arguing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I just feel like you guys
are just being pedantic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause it's funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean I feel like the argument is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are you a gamer or are
you not a gamer, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You are 100% gamer, we're only ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even if I was doing work, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna write a lot of emails and stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the point of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if I'm doing a lot of work, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm typing for a few hours, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah, I'm just gonna bring my own. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause like, for me it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I will be so much less efficient </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> using the laptop one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I just wanna be comfortable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, I'm ... okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That is just purely just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you looking for any like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I'm the scriptor here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually write more than you, Connor! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually write more than you! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the same like, because, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well you work one way, everyone
must work the same way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you've, you like ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, so if someone writes a lot, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're the ones that we should ask like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, tell me about keyboard ergonomics, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and how well ..." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, no! That's not how it fucking works! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are you saying that you
can't write as efficiently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> if you don't have the right
keyboard and everything? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How did you function before like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the 75% keyboards got popularized? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it was ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not doing wingdings! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We're not writing with a
fucking number pad, Garnt! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This has nothing to do with the 75% now! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Now we're talking about the
difference between laptop </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and keyboard! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I am! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, if ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, so you know your laptop </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't have a number pad, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I know! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not saying that it
doesn't have like a number pad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's why he brings
a portable number pad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just bring like a portable number pad! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No you don't! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No no no, I don't, I don't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - He brings a 5% keyboard
that's just the number pad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Listen. How you work is
like, totally up to you, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you are a person who
gets really agitated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> by a certain way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's just like, that bugs you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I think that's just, that's up to you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Could you just knuckle down sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and get on with it? Yeah, you can! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I mean, at the end of the day it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're doing something creative </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's something that
you're your own boss with, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're probably gonna
work as much as you want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And sometimes, comfort
is a factor in that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And for me, that's what I need. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but you're gaming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah but, if I am
working though, as well! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the same thing! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just don't wanna use it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right right right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Anyway.
- Anyway! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even know how we got onto this! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even know, man! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was the most long-winded, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> dumbass argument we've ever
had on Trash Taste, like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just felt like I
explained a very valid point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I got jumped on it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what you
were explaining, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't even know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't even know who you are! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That it is totally a reasonable behavior </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to not wanna use the laptop thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Because like, maybe it's
because I don't have a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> custom keyboard yet, but like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't fully understand- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't take my main keyboard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I take some like, $50 one that's ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I take my side bitch keyboard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just need one that's further away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and that I can set up to be more like ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, so you don't even take your good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> optimized custom keyboard? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not like the super expensive one, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just take like one that I can ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you have several keyboards? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah! Well I learnt my lesson. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause my keyboard broke one time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't do any work or
couldn't stream or anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I, you know, I was fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, well this seems dumb. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So now I just bought, I
have a spare keyboard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because like ... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a good idea if your entire job </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> revolves around doing like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> being able to use this one device. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You should probably
have backups of everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that could possibly break. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's fair enough, but
I don't think I've ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> broken a keyboard before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Keyboards break! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't break it. They break sometimes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - All the time, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, whether you've
had a key that was acting up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that was pissing you off, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or maybe the, yeah yeah,
it happens all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Keyboards are fucking frail things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 'cause to me like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mouses break all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I got like three backup mouses. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. 'Cause like,
maybe like this comes down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the conversation of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me in tech, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> even though I'm an engineer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't like, I just
need a job to be done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really care about aesthetics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> or like, stuff too much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just like ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not aesthetics.
I don't care about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You don't? Well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just about, it's about like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> preference of like, how I like it to work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for example like headphones, for example. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I literally don't like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My preference with headphones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is to buy like the cheapest headphones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can possibly, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I'm the opposite with headphones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I know people are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really really really anal ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - When you're talking about headphones </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you're talking about in-ear, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - In-ear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You don't use headphones, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't use headphones. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like clam shell headphones, you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Those are headphones, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> They're earphones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh sorry, yeah! Earphones! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Earphones, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I only use earphones for like running. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I only, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I prefer to use
headphones every other time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't, like yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to me like, headphones, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it might be because I have like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> jaw problems or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like if I wear headphones for too long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just like really starts to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> put pressure on my jaw and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like yeah, with earphones, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like, this is going above the tech, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like, there are certain things like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> earphones, sunglasses where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I try to buy the cheapest possible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I've gone through too many. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Or you know, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes you buy like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember buying like one ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What like, at the end of
every day you're like, crack! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> All right, next one! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No yeah, because like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes I misplace them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but especially with sunglasses, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so easy to misplace sunglasses, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially 'cause you wear them out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And sometimes you don't
always have your case on you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or sometimes you, you know- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] You don't have a bag or anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You take 'em off and you like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> clip them on your shirt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they just fall off sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've had that happen too many
times, and with earphones, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes you misplace them or you like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> forget that they're in your
jean pockets or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So the headphones kinda
make you uncomfortable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause they like, put
pressure on your head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the same thing
for me and the keyboard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the wrist though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It hurts my wrist if I
have to use that flat thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for ages. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause your wrist is like, why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why are we doing this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Also, I'm like paranoid about getting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> any wrist injuries- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like carpal tunnel and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah 'cause I, you know, I wanna game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well you game way more than us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so I ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a legitimate
concern for you, isn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm very cautious about
like, wrist injuries. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I want the most ergonomic
setup all the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why don't you get those
like, wrist guard things then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen a couple streamers wear them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean that's ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They normally have that
on when it's too late. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And they've already like, done the damage. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know some people who have it on like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to actually just prevent
it from happening- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean if you have a good setup, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you shouldn't need that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, but you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> even people with good
setups can sometimes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, game a little too hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like headphones like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for me it's like, I can't
have the in-ear ones, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause every single in-ear headphones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for some reason wants to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> excavate your ear, and
get really in there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that hurts the shit out of my ears. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I can't use those. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's probably because
you don't have like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the right size buds, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I have one that
comes with a bunch of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> replaceable ones, but even then like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> AirPods unironically are the
ones that I like the most, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause they don't really
go in your ear much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they kinda like, sit on top of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's what I like the most, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but I don't use Apple,
so I don't have them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's why I use
like the over ear ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Also the sound's way nicer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I only use the over ear ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if it's like in the winter, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it also like, keeps my head warm. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But like, in the summer here especially, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, no headphones, go away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I actually always use them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, like I've seen you like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> walking in like, the Japanese
summer with headphones on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, bro, that looks painful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is dedication there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, that's
just how I like listening! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the comfort. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean your headphones
have taken a fucking beating. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, I remember
seeing it and it's like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] It's like falling apart! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like falling apart,
man, like holy shit! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like, dude, buy
some new headphones, dude! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well it's 'cause ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's 'cause I'm waiting for the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right now I'm using the Sony WX1003, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> worst naming system of all time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sort it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - String of numbers and letters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then like the next one, the fours, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't really a significant upgrade. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm hoping that the fives, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when they ever come out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which I don't even know if they will, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are like a decent upgrade. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm kind of in that
weird spot where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're broken, and they're
not working properly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like, because they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, $300 headphones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want them to last like, five years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah of course, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, if I buy the fours now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then the fives come
out and they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the most best upgrade and you
can hear God through them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm gonna be really pissed
off that I bought these fours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I didn't just wait a few months extra. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But I don't even know if it's coming out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They haven't even
announced it or anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so I'm just waiting, kinda hoping. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're waiting for something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't know it's gonna come out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The one side is completely broken </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it keeps falling out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just duct tape that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This episode is sponsored by Honey, </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, you're the gamer, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You talked about keyboards, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 144 hertz monitors. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, if you genuinely
think there's no difference </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> between a 60 and 144 hertz you're a clown. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is there a point, if you don't play FPS. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I genuinely like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because we have in the
office, I've never used them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You notice it more with FPS games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But like, even normal games, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that are not like, locked to 60, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> look way better in 144. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's the problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I only play games that are locked to 60. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because you're on the Switch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you actually game on your PC, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 144 hertz is way, it looks
way better than, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd rather have 144 hertz than like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a more like, higher resolution. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - For me it's way nicer and smoother. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it just looks good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Resolution after- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's milky! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - After like 2k, I can't
fucking tell the difference. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I, 4k games- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Especially on a monitor, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Barely look any different from 2k to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But I feel way more difference
from 60 to 120 hertz, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 144 hertz. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 'cause I feel
the difference with FPS, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I just don't play FPS. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I was just like,
what are the game types, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> would really like, really
make me feel the difference? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I'm already ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Minecraft. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Any game where you're, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you're moving around, you're
controlling a character moving. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Minecraft's probably
the only one where I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably like, somewhat slightly seen it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You just notice it's just more fluid! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It looks kinda smooth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you'll notice when
you go back that it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> not quite the same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if you haven't got a lot of money, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're choosing between like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a better PC, or like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a monitor that makes you
like, (indistinct) instantly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then just get a better PC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Get better parts or something, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, it's kinda like the cherry on top. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But there's no point buying a monster PC </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're then not also gonna
get a good monitor for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause you're basically buying like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an engine with a car that can't fit it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, okay well, I mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's, you know, a lot of
people will have like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 3080s and still use 60 FPS monitors, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You've put like, rockets on a scooter! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, it's just too much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you're overpowering it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I game a lot, so I guess I ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I am that guy
who has a 3080 and ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No you don't fucking ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And uses 60 FPS, but like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's because it's like a
fucking monster to render </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I'm editing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's my thought.
- Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, same same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the only other like, I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're not gaming, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're doing industry stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I definitely use it like
that more than the gaming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I've definitely noticed like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a massive massive difference
with rendering and editing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, that's like, I don't
need 60 FPS to edit, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you're streaming,
it's also very good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because the NVIDIA cards
have dedicated video chips </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are completely
separate to the gaming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you can game and
stream at the same time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it doesn't affect the performance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It does a little bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> That's just 'cause they
have other things going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you think about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so do you care about the
keyboard thonk then? Like ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The ASMR sounds? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - The ASMR sounds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I like what I have right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe I should, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) can remind
me to record something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll probably forget. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's gonna play an ASMR of his keys! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like, I don't
know, it's a nice click! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a really nice click. It's subtle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause like, I'm on the fence right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm gonna be
getting my custom keyboard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> within like a few months, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so maybe I'm gonna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Man, Connor was right this entire time." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Couple months from now,
you're gonna be on that side! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah yeah yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like, I remember
going on this video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just looking at the comments section, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen less horny comments
on Pornhub comments, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, my god like, I literally feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone is cumming from
like the sound of these keys, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That's a nice sounding key, I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's weird 'cause it's
like, it feels like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> almost like PlayDoh-y at first, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you're so used to
the really harsh clicks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of other ones, and it feels like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Ooh, it's really like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> squishy and soft." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Like wet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then after a while, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get used to it and you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh no, this is actually
like, really firm." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or the clicks are really solid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But they're not like,
in your fucking face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not like it's screaming,
"Hey, you just clicked me! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hey, hey you just clicked it!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause you don't wanna be that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> asshole on Discord who's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> click click click click click! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because I remember
when mechanical keyboards </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got popularized, and that
was like the popular key. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because it was like,
everyone bought the $30 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> mechanical keyboard on Amazon, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause they thought
mechanical equaled good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> When in fact mechanical was just ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It was loud as shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just can't get over like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you describing like
the sound of these keys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you know, it just sounds like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, hearing the
experience of someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going on a drug I've
never been on, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like, "At first
it's like really wet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then once you get used to
it it gets like really firm, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like ..." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] It's true, it is true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's when the euphoria hits you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] It's the (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah!
- It's the lube! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the lube!
- It's the lube! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like they're in the, 'cause like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I lube my fingers when I'm using it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause when I was picking the keys, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause like, I'll take a picture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and send it to you (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like, I have like
a whole fucking like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Test keyboard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a test, it's a square of just keys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of different keys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, it's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's bad for someone with ADHD, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just like constantly poking it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're just like, "Ooh,
this just feels nice." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is a fun toy! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ooh this is a fun toy, this is! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, fidget spinners
got nothing on this! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you have to like click one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you have to choose
one key from like, 100. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, at some points, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, keys just like, meld together. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there are like, different like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the different like,
lubeness of keys and like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't know lubeness like,
mattered with keyboard keys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I'm just like, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> At which point, I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get it, it's like a hobby, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a hobby kind of object, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because you have to be really into it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to really care about it this much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A key-phile. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, a key-phile, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> At which point does it get like, too much? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where it's ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Never too much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it never too much? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's never too much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. I'm waiting, I'm waiting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm waiting for my first custom keyboard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - People are like, this is why
we're gonna have flying cars. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're the ones that are
gonna invent a flying car. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - People get too invested in this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Someone told me, I
was streaming yesterday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, completely unrelated, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you said ADHD so,
it came up in my mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "No no no, I checked," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause chat was accusing
me of having ADHD. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "No, I don't have ADHD." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, "I can focus on things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get really fixated on things." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're like, "You
know focusing too much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is a sign of ADHD, right?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "What?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And apparently it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, wait what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so if I concentrate too much on things ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have ADHD. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But if I don't concentrate
enough I have ADHD too? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yup. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like wait, what, hold up! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What does that mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What does that ... how does that work? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't be on too far of
either side of the spectrum. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause then you have
a problem, apparently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess, 'cause it doesn't specify </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can't pay attention. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's attention deficit disorder, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you've got too much
attention or too little. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I was just like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who's making these rules up, huh? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - People have ADHD, I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - People who are more informed than us! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, god damn these people! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Coming up with these definitions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, that's crazy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's usually the person
that says you have ADHD. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, officially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do you test if someone
concentrates too much? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How do you test ... I'm genuinely curious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] It's basically like
you can't control yourself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you realize that,
"Oh shit, it's like ..." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, you get lost in something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, I see I see. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Man] So you get obsessed with- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's kinda (indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Man] Yeah, it is, but at the same time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like, you can't control it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I feel there's a lot of people like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in just this internet age that, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because we're so fucking over-sensitized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just overwhelmed with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all this fucking information, right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> all at the same time, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> There are so many people
who are just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, there's so much fucking
shit to do on the internet! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do I have ADHD?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, no, you're just on the internet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, sometimes I wonder, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, I don't think like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have a problem. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I think there's just so
much shit that's being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shoved in my face. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah! That's what it is! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sometimes. I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But that's why like, I
reckon there's probably, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean like ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, I mean, you have ADHD. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> How does it feel? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I got ... it is weird, right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because the reason ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I only like recently
got diagnosed with ADHD </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was just like the most
ah-hah moment of my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, of course I do! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, oh, that's what that was! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah! Because like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially like growing
up in Asian culture, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mental health and mental conditions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are very like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Don't exist! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Literally that meme image
of, "Just don't be sad." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like ...
- Yeah yeah! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cutting the water faucet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, turning the water off, like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Don't be sad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Don't be sad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I remember like,
'cause I have this like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> such a vivid memory in school, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Of, I knew someone in school who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got diagnosed with ADHD and they got like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some like advantage or something in like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a test that we were taking, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They got like, extra time or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember like describing like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what his experience of ADHD was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was just like,
"What a fucking liar!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, "What a fucking liar! I do that! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's getting some
free time on an exam! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it just like, 'cause
like it just didn't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just, for some reason, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just never fucking occurred to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that unfortunately I
had the same symptoms, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I was raised ... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not even raised, but like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of people in my culture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the environment I grew up with, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was just, we were, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was put in our minds that, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mental health just wasn't really like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was either like a
very very serious thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or it just like, was, just didn't exist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you've just gotta
get on with your day, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like there's no such thing
as a mild symptom, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah yeah! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like you either had
it or you don't have it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what made you think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, I should go and see if I have it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, what was the turning point? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like what ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is gonna be awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Enough comments on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No way! Are you serious? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mentioning it. I am actually serious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you were like,
fidgeting with things? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Huh? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause you were fidgeting with things? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, seeing myself
on camera, I'm just like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Damn, man, I do that shit? What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah. Because like, obviously
I've never been on camera, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and especially with me being
on camera documented so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> on Trash Taste, I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> damn, I do a lot of weird shit! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So people psychoanalyze us all the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I understand- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We start to notice habits, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I started to notice habits, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you're looking at yourself
through the third person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And then also, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's always gonna be
comments that are like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> psychoanalyzing and over-analyzing stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, people say
some really wild shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> But then like, I saw some
comments that are just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fuck, they kind of make sense, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I Googled it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Google what they say, I'm like damn, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that doesn't look like it's just someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talking out their ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then like the final straw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was meeting someone here who has ADHD </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and they described their
symptoms, I'm like ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to go get diagnosed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to go get checked out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And yeah, it was thanks
to Trash Taste, I guess, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and thanks to random YouTube comments. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well done guys! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well done guys! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, it's like the
one time in the world where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you guys were actually
correct with your diagnosis. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you weren't just a bunch of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Reddit armchair psychologists. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've seen some wild ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I see some wild diagnoses. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I do. I have as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - In a few years of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's not an excuse to
psychoanalyze all of us, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> A broken clock is right
two times, you know guys? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember my, fucking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was growing up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone was like, convinced
I had like, dyslexia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "No, I don't think I do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I don't really have
a problem reading the words. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just really fucking hate doing it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, 'cause they would
describe the symptoms to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as like a, you know like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was like 10 or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So to give some back story to this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I went to a Welsh school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't like reading. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I liked gaming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was probably- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Gamer from birth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My parents probably wished that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nobody had ever introduced me to gaming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I was introduced to
gaming very very young. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're talking like, four, five, six. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I found out about video games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I became like, obsessed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I read the games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I've said this before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I beat all of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like one of the first games I ever played </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was Pokemon Gold in French, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I beat the whole game in French. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even though you don't know any French. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, this must have been literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the birth of me bashing
my head against the walls </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to figure out shit in
video games, not reading. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I've been doing this
since like a young age. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I never really, like, read stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I just kind of did it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is probably like, sounds very like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> monkey-esque already, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and not, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> not very intelligent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's very like, a primeval like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And I went to a Welsh school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So I didn't really read
English, like ever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We learned everything in Welsh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I spoke in Welsh in school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I never read English, like ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The only thing I'd ever read is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we go to the store, I can read the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would just read the fucking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Bread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, bread, whatever like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, when I would be quizzed on like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how to spell shit, I like, wouldn't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> They'd be like, "Spell said," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'd be like, "Oh yeah,
just Z. Z-E-D, innit? Said." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd be like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. So like, this is from
like age eight or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I was fucking awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so when we started
learning English more, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just don't read books, ever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're like, "What?
You don't read books?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And my parents were
like, "Yeah, we tried to! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We tried to make him read, he wouldn't." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But he keeps playing
those goddamn video games! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To be fair, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my parents tried their goddamn
hardest to get me to read. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just not gonna happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I was just, I had
absolutely zero interest in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was so so bad at English. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, they knew I was very competent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> at all other subjects. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I was very like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maths and science and all that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really really high marks, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I was, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean I got like A-star and
shit in maths and all that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like the highest grade you can get. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I went and did engineering and all that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So there's no problem with like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I wasn't like, bad at learning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just, I just
hated this one subject. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But they were convinced, they were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Well if he's competent in other stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he just must have some
dyslexia or something." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they would tell me
what the symptoms were. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was so annoying, because as a kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is where I started learning where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> adults like, fuck with you as a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They would like try and
spoon-feed me the answers to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to dyslexia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They would like, try
and tell me I had symptoms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I didn't have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And to like, get you to agree to it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just because they wanted to have like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so they can tick it off as like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, we've figured it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We'll sort him out." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then whenever I have any issues, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'd be like, "God, don't worry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we don't have to put in more work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's just dyslexic." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? Kinda? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> This is where you like ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get it, 'cause the teachers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they want an answer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They want a reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They wanted a solution, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They wanna know why,
and I can understand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone wants a reason why, but like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unfortunately mental
health and shit like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and learning is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the most complicated shit known to man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And there is never ever just
a one solution that fits all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah like, just because
somebody sucks at something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it doesn't mean there's
an inherent problem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with them, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I would like, talk
to my teachers and stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and I remember talking
to my English teacher </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she like, made me like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> stay after class and she'd talk to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she'd be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "So, you can read these words, right?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "Yeah, I can read them." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She's like, "They don't
look like messed up or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> jumbled at all?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "No, not really." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then she was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Sometimes the words are hard to read," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Yeah, I don't
know the word sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I don't really know it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's kind of hard to read, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause English is kinda funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the pronunciation is weird." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, so she was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hmm, okay okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So then another teacher
came in a few weeks later </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and started asking me more questions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about dyslexia and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "The words
are not fucking jumbled, okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen the movies, they
don't fucking do that!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I know that's not how
it works, but I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I do not have a problem! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can see all the letters in order! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They do not move, I know what I'm reading! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I am just shit at this subject, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I don't like it!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They just like, start
shaking your body like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What about now?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was literally like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thank god I wasn't a kid
that would just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I felt bad, 'cause like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kids are so easily like,
pushed into saying yes or no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm so glad I was a stubborn
fuck from like a young age. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where I was like, "No!
The words are not jumbled! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't have a problem reading the words, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just hate this shitty subject! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate English!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they were like, "No no no no no! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You have to be! You have to
have a disability or something!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You got this fucked! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You must be! You must be! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you must be! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm very glad that, I
don't know where I got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the stubbornness from, but I was glad! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like, I remember like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it was really annoying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they kept insisting I had it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, no! No! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] It's like, stop! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do not have this! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I have no problem reading Of Mice and Men! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just don't like it! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd rather watch the movie! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're like, tryna just
like brainwash you, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. So this is what I'm realizing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I understand now why like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, this whole discussion
about diagnosing kids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is like, I get why it's
like a touchy subject. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some parents are like, "My
kids! You can't diagnose them!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, you know, some people
are so quick to jump to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a really uncomfortable
subject and kind of touchy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause the kids often
can't, like I was a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I couldn't fully express that, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't just be like, listen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't really connect with
the subject, I don't like it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, they can't
fend for themselves, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I can't really fully explain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why I don't want to, why
I don't engage with this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But they'd, you know, they're just like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But they're like, "No, we're the adults. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> We know more than you." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's kind of a ... it's weird, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think that's why like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> when you get parents that
are super passionate about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and stuff, and then there's
also the thing of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some parents don't want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get their kids diagnosed with things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause they don't wanna like, be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "My kid has a problem," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> or has something, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My parents didn't really give a shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> They were like, "If he's got
it, he's got it. Whatever." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, just deal with it, but yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, 'cause I think with
how mental health is now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like, it feels like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> at least it feels like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you're diagnosed with something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then the kinda feeling is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, there's something wrong with me," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, there's
something broken with me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like, with me
and ADHD, for example. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I didn't realize that
I was abnormal, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I would have, I
would do all of these things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to basically be able to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seem like I was able
to function, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'd only learned recently that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was like my coping
mechanisms for like my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever, like how my
brain works, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had figured out ways to live with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I thought everyone had to do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, that's just what I thought. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And like, especially with like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after being diagnosed, it hasn't like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> changed my life or anything like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, the biggest
thing that it's done for me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like, it's just helped
me understand myself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think that's just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think that's like the
most valuable thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right?
- Definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sure. It makes sense of
things that you were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Why? Why am I like this?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah yeah yeah! Exactly! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause it's just helped me like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> deal with it even more. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I just remembered, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it wasn't just the
YouTube comments as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember specifically
seeing this one YouTube video, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that was like the last
straw, where it was like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dr. Mike diagnosed me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No no, where it was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it was like, "What ADHD feels like," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and someone like, edited
a video of their day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, edited it in a way to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> show how they perceived the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like thoughts and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, how they perceived the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was like, such a one for one copy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of how I see the world, I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh my god." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, that was like the ah-hah moment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I think there was
one scene in particular, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause he was going about his day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was like, being
scolded by his teacher </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or his mum or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was like, fidgeting, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was fidgeting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And he would get told off for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because his mum or his teacher, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember who it was exactly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they were just like,
"Can you concentrate, please? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm trying to tell you something serious, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're doing something else!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, and he said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, but it helps me to concentrate." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, that's
been my entire life! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's been, it like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I need to fidget with something
in order to concentrate, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and if I don't, I just lose like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my trail of thought or something, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's just like me! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah! I was just like, holy shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe I should fucking
go in and get this done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So wait, so how do they ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I've always been curious, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you go see a doctor, right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and you wanna like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> figure out if you are
actually diagnosed with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How does the doctor like, check that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is there like a test? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - He just puts like a
Rubik's cube on the table </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's like ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, "I'll be back in 15 minutes." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Puts like a fidget spinner on the table. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you think about this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah no, 'cause I've
always been curious like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, how does the doctor like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of determine whether
you actually have ADHD </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or if it's just like something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> similar to that that's not
necessarily ADHD, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I mean, at the moment I'm at like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm still like processing
it and learning through it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause at the moment, at
the beginning they take you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they do like this just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a survey first. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's like the first test. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then afterwards, if you tick enough boxes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like, "Oh okay, there's, you know-" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A chance, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a chance, then you
go in to the psychologist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know, they ask you like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a bunch of questions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For me at least. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, because like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> another friend in England just recently </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> got diagnosed with ADHD as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I think in England </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they have a different kind of process. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's probably different
to every country. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah yeah, I think it's
different to every country. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> In England I believe there's like a, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to go to like
a group session as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's different in every country, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but for me it was more
just a one on one talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with my, you know, with the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The psychologist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The psychologist, where
they just asked me like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very detailed questions about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my experiences, how I perceive events. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, I can't remember everything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause there was like a
lot of fucking questions, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was kinda, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was basically like a therapy session </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "So tell me about this experience." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Talk me through it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Talk to me about this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Tell me about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever since being diagnosed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've like, like I said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my life hasn't changed that much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just know now, it's
like written in paper, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that this is- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got the plaque now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No no, I got the plaque of just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Here's how your brain works, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and here's why your brain does this shit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And ever since knowing that, I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, that makes sense!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now I have like a word
to put to how I felt for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, that's it like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel a lot of people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of people maybe have, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe have different conditions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or different mental conditions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they've just never
really thought about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because, like me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe you found a way to
cope with it day to day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, because like me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe you thought that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, maybe everyone's like this!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you've just found
a way to live normally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you've grown up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You've grown up in an environment where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just need to like, just
get on with it, basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And a lot of the times like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not every mental condition is just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on the extreme end. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes it's like, really really subtle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But if you've ever like,
had a thought that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Maybe I do have this,"
or, "Maybe I do have that." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it might be worth
just talking to someone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not to like, have like a
life-changing ah-ha moment, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but just learning more about yourself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like is the most valuable thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that someone can do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And ... doesn't mean
that there's necessarily </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything wrong with you, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think more people would probably go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> if it was like, easier to get seen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - (indistinct), right, it's like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You gotta be either rich </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or have a lot of time on your hands. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or both.
- Or both. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To get anything done, healthcare wise, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or mental health wise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know in the UK it's not too great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I know they're like,
trying to get better at it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I know it's not adequate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, in the UK it's like
the waiting list is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's fucking, like huge. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No kidding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I feel like the biggest problem, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially like, everywhere
but America I can see, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> is like, access to mental
healthcare is difficult as hell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Especially in Asia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In Japan, dude! It's like ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my god! In Japan ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Half the time it's
just like, nonexistent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mental health in Japan
is the (indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> There is no ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, go to the pub, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> drink a beer, and don't think about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, I know why you're sad! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's because you're not drunk right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Go to an izikaya. Have a couple of beers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You'll be all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's just, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just like, I was walking home, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I saw a guy just like, on the floor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was crying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In Tokyo, and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Why is like, no one helping him?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, loads of people
just walking past him, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, why is no one saying like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, are you okay?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just so weird to me! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> People were just like,
"Man, I don't wanna ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't wanna get involved." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] That's so fucking sad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They see, 'cause you know, again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Collectivist society,
they see one, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> cog that's out of the
system, and they're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Well, that's not our problem. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We just gotta keep the system moving." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well the UK isn't great, but I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at least where I was from, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if someone was like, crying in the street, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like everyone would be
like, "Are you okay?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah!
- Yeah yeah yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd say most English-speaking countries </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> there would definitely be
at least a couple people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, "Hey, you all
right dude? What's up?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - At least like, someone checking on them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah! Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you know, not to say that Japan isn't, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, the fucking
cruel mistress of the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in that sense, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like there's definitely people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I've seen people, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go up to strangers and be like, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (speaks foreign language) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanted to help, but I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want this to be a awkward
language barrier situation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you actually need help </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'm just like,
(speaks foreign language). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I felt so sad about that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't do anything to help this dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just imagining what situations
he could be going through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made him so fucking sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, what if his parents like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> said he couldn't go home or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't fucking know, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> ugh, fuck it! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I just wanted to add
an addendum to what I said. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> If you do, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think a big issue
nowadays as well is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a lot of self-diagnoses. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, especially, I've seen
it on TikTok especially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The internet doctors. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, they're like, I've
read one Google article. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I am, like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, I got this ADHD, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or I'm like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well it's almost like
the, what's the word? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The like collection of, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> people kind of, say what you will, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but online they kinda see
it as like a badge of honor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah yeah yeah!
- Yeah yeah yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some people do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like, "If I have XX
thing and I have it in my bio, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I'm part of a group." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You get brownie points. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's weird! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or you're like, immune to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes like being an
asshole or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah yeah! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like it's just like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It sucks, 'cause you don't wanna be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Man, people are faking it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's like, there are people faking it! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] No, there are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - People see it as like a
badge of honor in a way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's like, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] And you know, even if you- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even if you're proud about it! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You could be proud about
it and be open about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it like, self ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] But like, don't
be a dick about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, self-diagnosing so that you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> then go and brag about it
online is like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - People actually have
to deal with this shit! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah, I know right? It ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then that whole
argument comes into like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Well, we couldn't
afford to go to a doctor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and get actual diagnosis," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like, yeah but you probably, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> still should never diagnose. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think anyone ever would
recommend you self-diagnose. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No no no, you could be
completely wrong about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially with something as delicate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and as complicated as mental health! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's like, like I said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the mind is a complicated thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And people do weird
shit a lot of the times, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and you can never know
unless you really see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like an expert, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - But then it also sucks as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause then you see an expert </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and maybe the expert was
shit at his job or something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you know? So ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's always just like
a fucking minefield of- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah.
- Like, like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Counterarguments. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you ever like, had
a bad experience with like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a doctor or anything like that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I've had doctors where I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yo, this thing is actually
like, fucking hurting me." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And then he's like, "Oh no, it's good." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'll be like, "What? Bro,
no, I'm in like some bad ... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a bit of pain." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, "No, you're good." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I go to another
doctor and he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh holy shit man, you got a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> this is like, you gotta sort this out." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've had a lot of
instances where I go to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> a local doctor, or like a
local GM and they'll be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'll refer you to a bigger hospital." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> After looking at it for like two seconds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you go to the bigger hospital </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh. Here's some drugs
you can get anywhere." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, why did the guy at the local GM </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not do that instead of
fucking wasting my time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taking me to another bigger hospital </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's way further away, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do the exact same job
that he could have done? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know? So ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's probably the only one I've had. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah because, especially me like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right now I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think my biggest 30s like health thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that I've found somewhat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like my jaw issue. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I've been like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to get someone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been trying to find an expert </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to help me sort it out, so, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, I go to the
dentist, to try and like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> try and find out what's
wrong with my jaw, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember the first time I've
tried to get it sorted out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was, I remember when I went to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> several dentists in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And one of them said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, do you still have your wisdom teeth?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they were like, and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, I still have my wisdom teeth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, they're not like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the spacing in it isn't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it isn't bad or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not like, hurting me
or anything like that." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, we recommend you
get that taken out." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do I, that's a big commitment, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you know, at the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was still a YouTuber. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So you know-
- You can't talk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can't talk for a while. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can't talk, you can't talk, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so I like, I wanted to make sure that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I needed to go through this procedure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I went to a second
dentist for a second opinion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "No, definitely don't take
your wisdom teeth out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's not the issue. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Here, have this mouthguard." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He gave me the mouthguard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It like, improved it a little bit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like the problem still persisted, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I went back to him, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's like, "Yeah, honestly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe you need braces or something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's gonna cost like
30,000 pounds or something." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's be sure I need to go through this! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like, at this point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd moved to Japan, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then come to Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I do the same thing, go to the dentist, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You don't need to take
your wisdom teeth out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but maybe just take the
top wisdom teeth out." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, I'm getting like a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like every dentist I've gone to so far </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> has given me a different opinion about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what needs to be done! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm like, who do I listen to? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you go to another one and it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so you only need to remove
half your wisdom teeth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just like the top half, just
like shave it off a little. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just shave the top off
and you'll be all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I'm just like, it's so like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna get it fixed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I just, it's scary because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever I go through, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a big commitment obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in time and cost, and it's my body. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna make sure it's done right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But at the same time, everyone I say, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone I meet is telling
me different things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I have no fucking clue
who to listen to, basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I got like tonsillitis like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I used to get it like every year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they were like,
"Just remove your tonsils." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, aw I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't really want ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause they say there's a chance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it can like affect your voice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was like, I'd rather
just be sick once a year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and have like a lot of pain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well you haven't had it
in a while though, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, luckily I haven't had it in a while. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I don't think I've had it in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- Luckily. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, I used to
get it like every year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I just didn't want my voice to change! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I like my voice right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's kind of important to my job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What if I change it and ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Although they say like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, you'll have a chance
that the voice will change, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's not like you're gonna be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (in high pitched voice)
"Hey guys, what's up?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (in normal voice) You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know I know, I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have learned how to use my voice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For like voice acting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Very specific, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can feel it- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess you don't wanna
like, relearn it, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know how it would feel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't ... they just
told me there's a chance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it could change slightly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For me, it's just not worth it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, I'll just be
sick every now and then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll take the sickness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Like, I'll just be sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tonsillitis isn't real. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not an illness! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a mindset! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a lifestyle! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That shit fucking sucks! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Have you had that? Have
you got yours removed? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah.
- No, I still have mine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I still have mine, yeah, as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh dude, when you get
it, it fucking hurt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have you ever had it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I've had it.
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's horrible.
- Never had it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Your voice, your like
throat closes up so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it feels like it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know there's like fucking squishy toys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you put your finger in it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That's how I imagine
your throat looks like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ew! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] It's horrible. It's so gross. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That sounds gross, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No thank you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not that bad. It's just your voice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, how do you get it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> You just like, is it like
a virus you pick up or? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I believe it's virus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like an infection on your tonsil. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It might be viral or bacterial. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kissing someone with it
or something, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sucking too many dicks, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now that I'm a Jojo
fan, I gotta be careful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can't be going on any (indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't wanna pick up tonsillitis </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from my next blowjob. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, generally I
just avoid going to the hospital </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> or clinic at all costs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like ...
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've said this before,
I just don't wanna go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd rather, I'll be
like dead before I go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Unless it's like, really severe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm in like a lot of pain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, we kind of went on
like a one hour tangent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> from Joey saying we're
gonna get back to explaining </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the title of this video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Holy shit, I completely
forgot about that! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - In true Trash Taste -
- Trash Taste classic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fashion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey's like, "We'll get back to this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We'll get back to this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they never did!
- One hour later. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so, we're gonna be
leaving Japan after this episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a little bit of time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Specifically two months. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Quote unquote. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it two months? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Month and a half?
- Month and a- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't really matter because I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you guys aren't gonna
know the exact dates, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but we're gonna be filming
Trash Taste abroad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we're going- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] All sorts of places. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we're going, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the next arc is gonna be
Trash Taste abroad, basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we're gonna say goodbye
to this studio for now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because we're gonna be filming in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of the different countries
that we're gonna be in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean obviously one we can say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because we announced it, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a couple of episodes
ago, but like you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if you guys watched the episode
four episodes ago, I think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where we announced we were going to AX. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> By the way, see you guys there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then obviously you'll know we're
gonna be in LA for a while. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yup!
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, we're filming
some episodes in LA. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And some in London as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we're gonna be, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because these boys are gonna be coming to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the wedding as well, my wedding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which, by the time of
release of this episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> should have just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It should have happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Should have already happened! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So congrats. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Congrats, I guess! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - If everything goes well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt is married if
you're watching this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt's married if you're watching this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is, yeah, I'll be a married man IRL </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by the time this episode comes out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - IRL as opposed to virtually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Massive W. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - As opposed to YouTube Garnt, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt's gonna be at the
alter and the guy's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Do you say I do?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Garnt's like, "Wait, what, why?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was fidgeting, bro. What's happening? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - So put the fidget spinner down! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Come on! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But yeah like, so we're gonna be filming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some episodes in London, some in LA. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we're gonna have
like, a lot more guests on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than we usually would for Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there's gonna be
like a lot of guests on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's gonna be like an (indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So we had like, no guests
for like 20 episodes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then we're gonna have
a lot of guests in a row. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And like obviously, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> some people are gonna like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Some people don't like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think we just wanna, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we wanna go somewhere and mix it up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and try something.
- Yeah! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you know, if you
don't like the episodes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> or you don't like, we'll be back! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, nothing's gonna change. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't worry, we have over
100 episodes at this point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you know, Trash
Taste isn't going anywhere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's something we wanna do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we wanna mix it up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we hope that the change of scenery </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> will look interesting as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean it obviously won't
maybe not look as professional, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but hopefully it'll still
be the same old podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nice breath of fresh air. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Because like,
we've had so many guests </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we've wanted to come on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's been like two years of just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> constantly waiting and waiting, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe it's gonna come, maybe? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then now that we can fly out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe, like, we are just basically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the floodgates just opening, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just, everyone coming on at once </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's everyone that
we've wanted to come on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we've talked to before
about wanting to come on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all coming on at once! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So ... we're excited. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's going to be a lot of fun, I hope. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- I think so! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It'll be a lot of big
episodes back to back, I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And we're not just going
to be filming guest episodes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're gonna be filming
some specials as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You're gonna have your like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your first Trash Taste
specials abroad as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're not gonna spoil
what those specials are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, yeah, we have- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Should be good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Should be good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah yeah. We have a
lot planned for Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> In the coming months. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And if you miss just us, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure there'll be some
episodes sprinkled in there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are just the three of us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah yeah.
- Definitely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know there's a good, a vocal bunch, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the subreddit that love
the just us three episodes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And I guess they're so used to it now, so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's such like an interesting
divide though, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in my head it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, the fucking guest
episodes are like, awesome, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like a new
person, new perspective, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, whatever, new
topics to talk about right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But then there are a lot of
people who are just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Who?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, you know like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they look at the four of us, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, "Who dis? Who dis man?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we try to make the guest episodes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so even if you don't know the guest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you can kinda, they can come on, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean we've had, what, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> three guest episodes
before this one, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also, you know, our guest episodes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> aren't as personal, so I
understand that people might not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> enjoy them as much, if
that's what they like most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because obviously we can't go into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot about how we feel about things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and our own life, 'cause it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> all right, we're tryna
make sure the vibe is good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and that the guest can vibe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well that's why we
decided to just have it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the three of us when we started, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because we were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if we put a fourth person in there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not a whole lot of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> deep conversation's
gonna happen, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was gonna be like too, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's gonna be too on the surface. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean we're clowns, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but sometimes we wanna not be clowns </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and just wanna chill and vibe, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Just vibing, bro! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just vibing! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - True, true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're clowns but we also
vibe as clowns as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a clown vibe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I'm sure they'll
be fun America stories </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> while we're there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm sure I'll gain a lot of weight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of fun UK stories
as well. I'm sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - God, I'm not looking
forward to gaining weight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I'm trying, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been trying my fucking hardest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to not gain weight before like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously my wedding as well, but like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really hard whenever you travel out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because one of the hardest things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is keeping to a schedule, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or keeping to habits. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, when you're
living in the same place, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you like, build this habit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, you can stay on this habit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's so much easier, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but when there's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even like a slight change
in environment or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, it's so easy for just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one domino to fall over, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like everything just falls over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you just like, slip into like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the complete opposite
lifestyle of what you had. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm trying my best to
stay healthy right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been like going to
the gym like every day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just like, working out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm like, I need it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to be healthy
before we go out there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Couldn't be me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, I also wanna
get in shape as well, so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean I feel more energized
when I've worked out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So I feel like I need that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I go on like the exercise bike </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> every now and then still, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at home, 'cause we bought one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quite a while ago, so like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever I have time, I do that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was going to the gym for a while, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then just that one trip out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like a week, just
completely throws everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out the window, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you come back and you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> well fuck, now I gotta start
from the scratch again! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And you're just like,
not motivated at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's just like,
it's just a complete, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like, habit killer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also depends on like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm kinda picky. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like if that, 'cause some hotels are like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we have a gym. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you rock up to this gym, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it is literally like
a treadmill from the 80s, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that like, it is just so shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're like, well okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean I guess I'll do that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they got like no weights or anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're like, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, all right, I guess I'll just run. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you're just like, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you go to the next place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're like, "We have a gym." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, gym's closed or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it's just like, it's so hard to like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stay consistent working out
when you're traveling and stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's impossible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't even try to pretend to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> try and keep up with the habits. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember when I was
going to the gym crazy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like when I lost the
majority of my weight, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like before I came to Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was doing it whilst
going to the conventions, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was so fucking hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fucking waking up in the
morning before a convention </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and going to the gym.
- To the gym? Oh my god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was so hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh my god, and also bringing
your gym gear with you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just bring your 75% dumbbells, man! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all you need, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> That's all you need! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't realize, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> In your suitcase, shoes
take up a lot of room! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah yeah yeah! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Weirdly! Shoes are a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then also, shoes get dirty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you're like, I wanna kinda like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cover them up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you gotta bring gym clothes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> which you're not gonna
wear any other time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Any other time! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, I remember before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I used to travel, I'd be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd have to use like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the weight limit to its
fucking maximum, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Oh, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like you'd have to
pack as much as you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and if you don't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you could squeeze in more there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but now I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna pack as light as possible, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, shoes are the most like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> annoying things, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So annoying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because they're like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because they're light, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they take up the most space. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well the thing is, are they light? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes shoes aren't light! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, if you're packing like, boots, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like if you're packing
like fucking Doc Martens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> then it's like, I need like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> separate luggage just for
these fucking Doc Martens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because like, here's the thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, do you normally pack
extra pairs of shoes with you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I only pack the everyday
shoes and the nice shoes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It depends where I'm going. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sometimes, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if I'm going to like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> say like a completely different, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if I'm going somewhere that's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really summery and beachy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll take like, a couple
of like flip flops. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, flip flops don't count! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They aren't shoes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like, you know,
if I'm going somewhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I know I need to go to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a fancy dinner or
something, then you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll bring some like, dress
shoes and shit like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah yeah, and they
are just like the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fiddliest things to try and
fucking fit in your luggage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But if I just need
like, a pair of sneakers, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> then I'm just taking the
one pair of sneakers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah yeah.
- You know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like how many jeans do you bring? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> How many pairs of trousers do you bring? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, one pair of trousers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah 'cause- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, one pair of jeans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I'm just like, for some reason, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so weird, I like
bring like 10 T-shirts, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> five hoodies or whatever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, do I need
an extra pair of jeans? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes the answer's no, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I saw this YouTube Shorts, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it was people going around asking people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how much underwear they brought
for like a five day trip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I was just like, I was shocked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it not five? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah! Well how much would
you bring to a five-day trip? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How many pairs of underwear? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, it's five minimum, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but sometimes I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe I need that extra pair of underwear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe I'll shit myself?
- Maybe I'll shit myself! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe I'll shit my- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not underwear. It's socks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How many pairs of socks do you bring? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I always bring extra socks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you might run into an instance where like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say wherever you are is
rainy, for instance, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Your socks get wet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't wanna wear those wet socks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the rest of the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, but see, I'm
talking about underwear. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Socks I can kind of ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, underwear for me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if it's a five day trip, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm bringing max six. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - How much are you guys bringing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What are you guys bringing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] Max six. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - For a five day trip.
- Six? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Man] Max six. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Six, right? Six? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Man] Socks? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Underwear.
- Underwear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> How many pairs of underwear
for a five day trip? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Six.
- Yeah, six. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, for me, the amount of socks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and the amount of underwear
you bring should be equal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey you were, your face was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, yeah, yeah." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - On this video, people were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eight, nine, 10, 11. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And then like, three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was as if I had like, one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like, whoa. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, eight? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is happening? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are you bringing eight pairs of under- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What has happened on your trips? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You gotta like, double up, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When you're working out, it's
a different story, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause if you're planning
to work out, I get it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because when I work out- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're gonna sweat in 'em. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm running through socks and underwear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, of course! Of course! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not re-wearing that underwear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sucks, 'cause you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> fuck, I only got half a
day out of this underwear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need to fucking wash it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Kinda sucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, if you're just going on a trip, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> why do you need more than five pairs? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It doesn't make any sense to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It also depends on the climate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause if you're going to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially like a southeast Asian country, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you are sweating through
that fucking underwear, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, that's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're taking like four showers a day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah yeah yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The swamp ass, man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like, it's on another level. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You need those extra
pairs of underwear, man! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like, this was like in America. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I don't think there's
a single place in America </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where you need more than
five pairs of underwear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Aw, I guess, unless
you're going on like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> five day trip to like, Death Valley. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe, like, I just think that like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I've been trying to like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like I said, I'm trying to minimize. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But also, did you ever
try and do anything sneaky </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> with your suitcase at the airport? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Did you ever try to like,
get past the weight limit? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How so? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - One time ... I can't remember
which airport it was in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The thing where the suitcase was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was no other staff to this side. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> There was just the person
there behind the desk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I had the suitcase just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the suitcase I had was kinda like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the wheels were kinda, like not centered. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not on the edge, but like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of going towards the center. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the edge was leaning off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I just do that
thing where you just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put your foot, and just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slightly lift it up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like, get a kilogram or two off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then just hold it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like some kind of Nen user, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You gotta have the conversation while just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> slightly holding it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it was gonna go over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I knew it was over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because on the way there it was over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So on the way back, I was like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How much was it over? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like five kilograms. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, fuck. You're not
getting away with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I, no I did! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Huh? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got it down to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was 20 kg limit, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was going to like 24, 25. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 20 kg limit? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Who are you flying with? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Most of the airlines have
20 kg on one bag, limit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it not 23? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Normally 20. Actually,
it depends on the airline. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] A lot of them are 20. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, sometimes 15 as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to shave five off
this bag (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was so- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Warm up the calf. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, it was so hard! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I'm like, on the desk like this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to get my documents. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like ... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> My foot is like steel right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, lifting it up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But you gotta keep it even! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause if it's wobbling, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they know what you're doing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like, I figure,
what are they gonna do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're not gonna kick me off the plane </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if they find out I'm- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just reminds me of like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> in Giorgio where they put the chocolate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> under the water, and just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> change the level of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> While you're just having a conversation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been fucking with
you this entire time! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I knew, 'cause I had to
pay the fee on the way there! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I didn't have any
other way of taking it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They charged me like, $70 or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> To bring on this bag. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> The flight was like 300! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was broke! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I couldn't afford 70, so I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm gonna do this, bro." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it was like a Jojo, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fight thing, where I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> holding it up with my like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> left foot on the desk, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doing my passport, getting the ticket. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - He was like, Nani! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Put it on, and when I put it on, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I just kept talking to her, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so it seemed like nothing was ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I wasn't that close to it either! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the desk was really tall. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And there was no one else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you can't see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one could see me doing it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there was no one behind me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was scared that
someone would call me out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but no one did, so yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It all worked nicely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, if there was someone behind you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they would have just been like, "Damn." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, if somebody called me out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd have been like,
"What is wrong with you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me, you wanna be
fucked over by them too? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Come on!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But one time, I will say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was moving to Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I had like, three suitcases, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the woman was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> my suitcases were like, way over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I had like, my
computer gear and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was like, 10, 15 kg over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she just like, looked at me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, I must
have looked really sad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I was like, I'm moving! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And she was like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (sighs) All right, I won't tell anyone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then she just let it off for free. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Aww, that's- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love it when they do that sometimes! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so hard, so because like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here's the thing, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've had to like do similar things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I try to prepare as much as possible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> before going in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you weigh it and then you're just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how much can you like,
physically bring on a carry on? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you push that to the limit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because you have the carry on, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and then sometimes you can have like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a bag, which is not too big, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or doesn't look too big. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's not allowed to be big. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like, you push the limits about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> how much you can have on a carry on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and a personal item? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that what it's called, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, a personal item. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you have to spread
things as equally as possible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I noticed like, the
magic number is between like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> .5 and one kilograms, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If it's between, if it's over, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by like less than like, one kilogram, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or just like ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I've met airlines that it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if it's exactly one kilogram,
they will charge you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if it's like, 0.9,
they're just like ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We'll let it go. We'll let it go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> The 0.1 kilograms makes a big difference. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That just reminded me of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the time when I got stranded in Canada, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one time, because I lost my passport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I don't know if I've told
this story on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, this is like
five, six years ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I went to a con in Montreal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hanging out with a bunch
of mates or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I was flying back to Australia, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I had to stop by in Toronto first. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it was like, Montreal to Toronto, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then Toronto back to Sydney. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So then, I got to Montreal Airport, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, "I can't
find my fucking passport." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you know, this is the first time ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've lost my passport,
let alone overseas, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is fucking terrifying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I find out later that my
friend who was with me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the con the entire time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I had accidentally put
my passport in his bag, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he had already flown home </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back to like, I think he lives in like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> San Jose or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So he was already in America,
with my passport in his bag. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so, I got to Montreal airport- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's like, nightmare. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] It was. It was a
fucking nightmare, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I'd cry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. No, and like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got to Montreal airport, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I told them the situation, they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, what you can do is that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's an Australian
embassy in Toronto anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So just, we'll let you
fly to Toronto at least, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but then you're gonna
have to find a hotel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go to the embassy, get a new passport." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, you know, I'm fucking
freaking out, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I fly to Toronto. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I put in a hotel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then my friend who
had the passport was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I can try and like, email," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not email, but like ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "I can try and send this to you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, mail it to you," right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Through like, FedEx or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, I don't know how
long it's gonna take, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not to mention, it's technically
in a different country. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So it has to go through
like, customs and shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I stayed in that hotel
for five days straight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - FedEx? Took five days? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Five days. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bruh. Bruh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did he like, cheap out? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No no no no no no! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was stuck in customs for
like, three and a half days. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bro! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it got to Canada, like
on the morning of day two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But because it's just a passport, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was literally just
stuck in customs for like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three whole days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What the fuck were they doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, checking it
was legitimate or something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, no illegal activities or whatever? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, I, dude like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was so fucking depressed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause like, I'm stuck in this hotel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the middle of Toronto. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know anyone
who lives there, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wake up in the morning, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm literally sitting in
front of the reception phone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just hoping that I get a call being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You've got a package." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hope you had an ergonomic keyboard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I didn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, if I only had my 75%. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Damn, dude! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You were training up for COVID, man! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like, so the first
thing I had to do though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was I had to go to Toronto airport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like, change my flight, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> To be like, "Hey, I've lost my passport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what to do." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was like this like
Canadian woman who was there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she was like, "Okay, um, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's an unfortunate situation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we can change your flight for free, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you fly tomorrow." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know, I didn't
know when this package </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was gonna arrive, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was just like, "Okay
yeah, sure, let's do that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just so I don't get my
flight completely canceled. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Of course, next day happens. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't arrive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Oh shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So then the next day I had
to go back to Toronto airport, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the same woman was there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she was like, "Okay. If
you wanna change it to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two or three days later, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is the next available flight, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's gonna cost you like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a couple of thousand dollars." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Jesus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And at the time, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'd only just
started doing YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't have that kinda money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was still living off
fucking scraps, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For YouTube Ad rev. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I was like, and you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, on the verge of tears, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> being like-
- I would be too! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - On the verge? I'd be
crying already! Like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was on the verge of
tears and just being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I don't have that kind
of money right now." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, what do I do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Should I call my mum? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's like, three in the morning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in Australia right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Blah blah blah blah blah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then the woman just like, kinda like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just looking at me
panicking for a little bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then she just starts
typing away on a keyboard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then she prints out this ticket. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For two days to go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she hands it to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then she just, I'll never forget it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she just says, "I'd better
not see you here ever again." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my god! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And she just gave me this free ticket. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Dude, I fucking cried. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I just like, I like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got on my knees and I
just broke down crying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because this lady just
literally just gave me this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> $2000 plane ticket. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just, because she felt sorry for me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, that would
never happen in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> In Japan it's like, "Hold on,
I gotta call up the manager," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then the manager's manager. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh no. In Japan they'd be like, sorry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They would never let it happen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So like, luckily, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> two days later, I got the fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, passport, and I got the package. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I fucking ripped that
shit open in the hotel room, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> saw my passport, broke down crying again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm like, finally I can go home! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got to Toronto airport
and I got my flight back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, whoever you were, lady, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I will never fucking forget you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was like, that was the
moment where I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> People are awesome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There is a god! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can confirm that that
would never happen in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I didn't have that
much of a stressful situation, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but something kinda similar
happened to me recently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So, recently we went on a trip together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And after the trip, I was
meant to fly to America. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Fly to America to meet Sydney's family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I haven't seen
them since before COVID, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I wanted to see them
once before I get married, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and become one big happy family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I had the tickets booked, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and because the schedule was so tight, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had pre-packed all of my travel stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before going on the trip
with the boys, basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sydney flew out, I believe
like, a week before me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So she had flown off already, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember, I packed
everything before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I put my passport in my travel bag. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember coming home, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I remember being absolutely knackered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from coming back from this boys' trip. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> checking everything was ready to go, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ready to fly in like a day or two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I notice the bag is missing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no.
- Oh shit! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then I start panicking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I know the most like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if there's one document I need, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's my passport! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right? Especially because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm getting married in two months. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't be losing my fucking passport. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to fly back to the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I like start fucking
searching around the house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and everything, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "She better not have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She better not have." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I phone her, I phone her, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and she's asleep, and it's 2 a.m. right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wake the fuck up! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I give her like 10 phone
calls, she's not picking up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Phone her mum, she's not picking up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Luckily her dad was still awake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Luckily, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Russel, I need you to
do me a massive favor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can you wake Sydney up now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can you wake Sydney up, right now! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right now!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And so, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He rushes over, he wakes Sydney up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, "Sydney,
do you have the bag? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you have the bag, Sydney?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she was like, (mumbles incoherently) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Sydney!
Sydney, this is not the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be asleep! You need to wake up now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you need to check
that you have the fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Aska travel bag, okay? Do you have it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she's just like, "Um,
yeah. Yeah I have it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Is my passport in there?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she's like, "Oh fuck." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh fuck! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so, like she, like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, I don't know why she had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> never used this bag before, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is the one time
she decided to use this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as a travel bag. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But unfortunately she
didn't check the contents </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the bag, so ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who doesn't check a bag? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Was there like, nothing else in this bag? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Was it just the passport in the bag? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was my passport and my other like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> vaccine travel documents that I needed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So basically all, everything you needed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> So everything I needed
to travel out of Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the actual fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it was like, empty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It started from like the front pocket </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> which had like, literally like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the one, everything I needed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your life.
- Yeah, my life. My life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your proof for existence. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, my proof of
existence to Japan, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so we're like trying to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plan this out to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> can I make this flight if we like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do a frame perfect like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> frame perfect drop of this to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking DHL, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And we're like, "What's the closest DHL?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, so it's this place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We can go home, you can wake
up tomorrow and go get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, I've realized unfortunately, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's America, and they
don't work on the weekends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Oh fuck! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I'm like, oh fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have to wait two days
before they can even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> put the drop-off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Even if DHL are like, super on point, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which they were, actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> DHL were like, very fast about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm still not gonna get it in time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I have to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I wanna go to America- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Change the strat! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I have to like, delay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to like, change the flights, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that was stressful enough, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not having my passport on me, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I remember phoning up ANA. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To be like, look. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm in this situation now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't know if I
qualify for a change of flight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the thing is, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I believe I bought a
flexible ticket, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I wasn't, I didn't buy one on like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't buy a ticket, on
like some random fucking site. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You bought it from ANA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I bought it from ANA itself, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I thought, paying like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a bit of a premium price, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as opposed to buying from like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking Skyscanner or whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that there was a little bit
of wiggle room on that, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it wasn't a cheap ticket. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, I don't know why
flying to America right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is so fucking expensive,
from like everywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it was like, the cheapest
economy ticket they had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was still like, fucking like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> almost like a grand, or like two grand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't fucking remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jesus.
- Jeez. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - One way? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, one way! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fucking hell! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah yeah, it was like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Aren't one way flights
though, weirdly expensive? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Return flights are like, weirdly more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like less expensive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's something to
do with how long you're gone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's different
price points based on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're flying with the same carrier </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and how far apart you're flying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's some really strange
rules with ticket pricing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so I phone up ANA, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, look, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> here's the situation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Can I change my flight? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can I change my flight to, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a few days after? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or whatever's convenient. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're like, "Yes,
there's a flight on X day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's still available,
I've still got seats." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, great! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Can I change to that flight? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How much would it cost?
Would it cost anything? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember her like, hearing like the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the keyboard tapping. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's never good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then she pauses. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she pauses, and she's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> "Um, hold on, can I, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I need to go see the manager quickly." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm like, that's not- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's not a good sign. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's not a good fucking sign. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everything in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If anything needs the manager. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah yeah yeah. 'Cause I'm like, oh man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> how many hundreds of dollars
am I gonna have to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking pay to like change my flights? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then like, I wait
for like five minutes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, okay, I can afford
like a few hundred dollars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> luckily enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I really wanna go see the family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then she comes back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then she's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Okay. I have just
confirmed with my manager. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you would like to
change your plane ticket </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to this date, it is $4000." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Can you repeat that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Could you repeat that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Could you repeat that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Could you repeat that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That doesn't make any fucking sense! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause they said it in yen, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause they said it in
yen, I was just like ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 400,000 yen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "My Japanese must be rusty, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I think I must have misheard." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There must have been some static! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah! 'Cause I think like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that what it is in Japanese? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I must have added an
extra zero in my head, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because that is not 400,000 yen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I must have heard 40,000 yen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And just misheard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, "Could
you repeat that please?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they repeated
that, and I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "So, to confirm, in English, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is 400,000 yen, right?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was like, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my (indistinct) is not
(indistinct) enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm (indistinct) right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My (indistinct) is definitely not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct) enough right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm mishearing this, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my god! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then she was like, yes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is 400,000 yen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was just like ...
how is this possible? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And she was like, "I apologize. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because there's a small change fee </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the tax is different." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I couldn't understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, no matter what she says, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there is no justification </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for an increase from like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, you got a flex ticket </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and somehow it ended up costing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> more than the original ticket. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like you're not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you didn't like, upgrade to
business class or anything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right, like that's the kind
of price we're talking about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - This was economy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was just like, "Is that 4000 yen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on top of the two?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, is that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] On top of the thousand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that like, 4000 on top of the ticket </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I just already paid for? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And she was like, yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's a $5000 one-way
ticket to America. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so like, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "There is no fucking
way this makes sense." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I go on fucking Skyscanner. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, as we're on the call, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I can see, I can buy a
ticket on your website </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for $2000. Like, a new ticket for $2000. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How does it make sense
that you're charging me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> $4000 to change my ticket? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> To change it? Change it, right?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she was like, "I apologize, sir, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's just how the system works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the upcharge for
changing the ticket." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, that's a scam, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I'm just like, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, it's cheaper for
me to buy a new ticket </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even if it's like double
the price at this point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from what I originally paid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Can I get a refund for the original </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ticket I paid? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's gonna cost you $1000. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For the original ticket I paid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> In order to get the refund back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I can buy a new ticket. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And she was like, "Oh yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> The cancellation fee will be $900." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How? How? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What's the justification? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How does that work? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Didn't you buy a flexible ticket? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Isn't the whole point of these that they- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Flexible tickets
means you can change it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You can't refund it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some of them let you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some of them do! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can change it! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some of them do, and I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Am I talking to the circus right now?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I didn't say that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's what I wanted to say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You are not the clown! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You are the whole circus right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Am I applying for clown (indistinct)? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> What's going on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my god, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So my choices are either to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pay $4000 to change my ticket, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or to like, get $900, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to pay $900 to cancel a ticket- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To buy a $2000 ticket. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - To buy a new $2000 ticket. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, I am not doing this! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, after like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so, for the first time in my life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Can I speak to the manager?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I, 'cause the thing is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I am not the type of guy
who goes Karen mode, okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I am not the type of guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But they were taking the piss! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I think anyone in that situation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would go Karen mode, 'cause
that's fucking ridiculous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I ask for the manager, and like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it was, the reasoning for
like the upcharge of that much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is because I wanted
the flight within like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if I had waited I believe like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I believe like eight
days, eight or nine days, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> then it would be a lot cheaper, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but because there was this like, window, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I wanted to change the flight to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though there were flights available, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the flight ticket
was cheaper to buy new, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> changing to that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> changing to within that date range </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> meant that they had to
upcharge the ticket. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And there was nothing that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which still doesn't make sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, which still doesn't make sense, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so there was nothing I could do about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I talked to the manager, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Look, is there anything
you can do at all, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because like, I'm not lying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but this is ridiculous." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are not giving me any way out- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd be pissed off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You are not giving me a solution. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My solution is, I pay $900 to pay $2000. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is so dumb. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like like like, you are not- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's literally like
the enter the lottery </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to buy the ticket, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my god! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, unfortunately, I
didn't get a solution. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I lost $900 to cancel my ticket, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I flew to England for
a fraction of the price </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for this headache to go to America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah, unfortunately- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know what's going
on with flights to America. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's insane right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was trying to get flights from the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Inflation, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, flights from the
UK to America as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's crazy expensive! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, what the fuck? Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Meanwhile, flights from
Tokyo to London were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like $1000 with business! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, what the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is happening? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one's wanting to
go to the UK right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I think no one's wanting
to go from Tokyo as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, that's true, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. So okay, I got, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I gotta ask now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Just remind me, have you
guys ever gone full Karen? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Have you guys ever needed to like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ask for the manager? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] I don't think so! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Joey, don't answer that! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I could legitimately say no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but of course the entire fucking
audience is gonna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, legitimately, no I haven't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause, just like, I'm
not the kind of person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like, go to a restaurant and be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "My soup is 20 minutes late." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, I don't fucking care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like I normally try to like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'm talking in those situations, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I normally try to build up
some rapport with the person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm talking to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they'll normally be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yo listen, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing can be done." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'll be like, "I mean,
I'll take your word for it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, there's like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel there's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if there is a problem with
some kinda service or, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, situation, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> there's only so much that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know the manager can do anyway, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I'm just like, just don't even bother. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll fold, I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it's not a life or death situation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - In that situation I'd be tempted to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but even then I'm like,
I'm so lazy that I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all right, I guess ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I also don't wanna cause a scene. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, even though I'm
perfectly in the right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to cause a scene, because I'm
the one getting fucked over, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, there's a part
of me that's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no, I don't wanna like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be the asshole, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's like, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, I don't think I've ever ... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never done it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I mean, I don't think like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, it's weird, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause like, if you cause a scene, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes you get what you want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It sucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it's like, I don't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd just rather not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've been in situations where- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wish you would just treat
me like a human being. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I've been in situations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I've been in like
a restaurant or whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and I've seen someone else cause a scene, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they get what they want, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, what an asshole! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause the thing is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's, 'cause I hardly ever go full Karen, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but I've seen it work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just like, I could, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't have the ability
to do that myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I remember like, on
this trip back to England, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there was this point where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we were on a night out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We were with all our friends, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And Sydney was tired, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so like, I took her home, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> took her home like, earlier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone else went on drinking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And eventually they ended
up in a casino, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I was like,
cool, I'm not tired yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it cool if I go out to, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> continue with my mates
and continue drinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and have fun? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I was like, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sydney was already passed
out, so I was like, cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just gonna go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Please make noise if you object. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't hear anything! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (overlapping chatter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so there was a sizable
group inside the casino. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I get there, and I wanna go in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's a bouncer at the door. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's just like, sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't come in unless you're a member. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just like, but, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know you've let plenty
of other people in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because my entire friend
group is in there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And my entire friend group was in there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they weren't members, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so what's happening with that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then he was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he was like, sorry, no members right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No entry right now unless you're a member. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know he can let me in, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not like a massive casino, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the thing is, I
see people walking out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I see like, plenty of people walking out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I like, you know when you can tell, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, that there's a bouncer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who just wants to go on a power trip. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Like, you know what I mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like, I knew it wasn't like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it wasn't like the busiest
place in London or whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a place that I
knew the bouncer was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to be an asshole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I could clearly see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there were people walking
in and out, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there were people that were going out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and saying that they were leaving, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so I was just like, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> what is the right angle to go for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to try and get myself in, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I guess you wanna
see your friends, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I really wanna see my friends, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because the night wasn't
even like that late. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was it like a Saturday or something? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Was it a Saturday or, like a Tuesday? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I believe it was a Sunday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I could understand maybe
if it was a Saturday, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it was really busy, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they'd maybe wanna limit it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to customers they know are gonna spend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a shit ton of money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it wasn't even
like that busy, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it wasn't even that busy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so he's just being a dick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because, 'cause here's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so 'cause like, so I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, I gotta at least
try to get in, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because if I don't get in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't get to say
goodbye to all my friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like my night's over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm gonna at least like, try to get in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And of course, I don't go full Karen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I try to go for like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 75%. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I go for the friendly approach. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know? Like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You gotta start from
like the moment one, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - The rapport approach, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The rapport approach. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - The (indistinct) approach. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, the (indistinct) approach! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But there's nothing wrong with like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, tryna explain, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, maybe if there's not
like a giant line behind you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Listen, I wanna see my friends, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're all in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (chattering in agreement) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Calmly explain the
situation, right? Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd be like, look mate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I understand that you don't want like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a big group of like, strangers
coming in or whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at this time of the hour. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get that, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just like, you got some rules </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you need to follow
and everything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Look, I'll be honest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just one guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not local around here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I've literally flown in from Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just to hang out with my mates, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I don't get this chance often. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The sympathy approach. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I was like, dude, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not here to like, ruin your night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not here to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I will spend fucking money in there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know you just don't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some fucking random dickhead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like walking in and
everything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I am not that random dickhead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not drunk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like a good- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm a good boy! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm a good boy, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can attest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt is very well behaved. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt is very very well behaved. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I was trying to be as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well fucking spoken as possible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> This was like me like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> putting on the tuxedo, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Speech 100. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Winnie the Pooh meme. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Speech 100, but like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking hell, this guy
just was not having it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He was like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Some bouncers are like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> They're just like, they're not having it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause the thing is,
he would not even like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> have a conversation with me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like he was like, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can get it, 'cause they
probably deal with like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some really fucking awful asshole drunks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I get it, I get it. I get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But at the same time it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes you're like, dude, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not the problem here, dude! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not the one causing you problems! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess maybe I am by talking
to you too much, but ... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like, look, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, and eventually, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like ... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fine, I guess, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, I guess my night's over. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then one of my
friends comes out, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And she sees what's going on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she's like, "What's going on here?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, they have some rules, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the bouncer's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not communicating with me at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think there's any way to get in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she's like, bet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> She's like, Karen mode activated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was like, an instant like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an instant switch to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Um, excuse me? Like, do you know that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> he's getting married in a month!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought she was gonna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Do you know who he is? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's the anime zone! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The greatest YouTuber!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And she goes, and
she's able to just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> go on this like, somehow- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This guy probably
wants to get rid of her. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, fuck this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like this fucking
five minute rant, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when Senator Armstrong is
just like, standing there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and (indistinct) is
just like fucking like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pulling the punches, and he's just ... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not budging. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he's not budging! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, after about five minutes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's just like, "Fine, you can go in." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like, "That
worked? That worked?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought being like
the nice guy would work! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But just like, fucking like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going like, just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just going full Karen and just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> calling for the manager </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just like, not letting up? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That works sometimes! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I think that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, I think the reason why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't go Karen mode, like, ever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is because I've been on the
other side of that before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like when I used to work at like a bar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, oh my god, I
still remember this dickhead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to this day, but like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was this absolute knobhead who, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he came in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was working, when I was working
up at the ski (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was working behind a bar, some nights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you know, I had to
pour like beers and shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then of course this fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this dickhead walks in with
like, 10 of his mates, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was like, and he said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oi, oi, can you come here for a second?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, oh, you're talking to me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, yeah, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's a bit weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he's like, "Can
we get 20 B-52s please?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And to explain what a B-52 is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's this liqueur shot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's three layers, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so the layering shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you've ever made layering stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you gotta like, slowly pour it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the back of a spoon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> otherwise it mixes, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So in other words, making one
of these takes a long time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because you wanna make
it look nice, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this motherfucker was
like, 20 of them please. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Okay, sure." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was the only one at the bar, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, all right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I better start fucking
slaving away at it then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But, you know, because it's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, a restaurant, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like a bar, I wanted
it to like, look nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not just gonna
fucking pour it in, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I start pouring, you
know, a couple of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then around like, the
third one that I'm making, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this dickhead just walks into the bar, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he was like, "Oi, where
the fuck are the B-52s?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was like, "Get your manager!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "Motherfucker,
you wanna make it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You wanna? Be my guest! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Be my guest, dickhead! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Make it right now! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You wanna make it any faster than me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you want them or not? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You haven't even paid for it yet! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even have to make 'em for you!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so of course, but you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what I said in my head, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But on the outside I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'll get the manager right away." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So then the manager- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I am the manager! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So then I call the manager over, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and she's like this Japanese lady, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> who looks really nice on the outside, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but on the inside she's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a reverse Karen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, 'cause she has to deal with like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause she has to deal with
dickheads like this, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So then she comes out and you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this nice like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> short Japanese lady
comes out and she's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, what seems to be the problem?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know, this guy
starts going off being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, so he's fucking taking forever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> making these drinks, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like we've been waiting forever." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> By forever they mean like,
you know, 10 minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, I've never seen someone go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> reverse Karen on a customer before, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she was just like, "Um, excuse me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you wanna make these? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think so! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So give him some fucking time!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love videos of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the employees of fast food places </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just chewing out fucking- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah yeah, just being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and she was just like,
she literally was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> "Get out." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Good, yeah! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Fucking too right! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he was, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going off and being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "This is the worst place ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck you guys." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She was like, I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Get out. Get the fuck out, right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, and you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because I was like,
fucking too shy and like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scared to like say anything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so in the back I was like, yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Get 'em! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, get 'em! Get 'em! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I've been in that situation before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So I think every time, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm in a situation where, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> perhaps something is late or, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where most people wouldn't
want to go Karen mode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in some situations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I always remember that
situation, I'm like, no! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna be that dickhead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll wait. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well because like, part
of the reason that I was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, 'cause, I got like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> slightly annoyed at the bouncer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't because of the fact
that he wasn't letting me in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But because like, he just refused to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> engage with me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - At all. Because like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He wouldn't explain it to you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, he just wouldn't explain it to me! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because like, I could like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could tell he was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> he probably had a bad day or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't fucking know, but like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he just wanted to exert
his power upon someone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I could feel that energy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause like, I've been to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> places before where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you talk to the bouncer, and
they explain to you like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> look mate, it's (indistinct), </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's nothing I can do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know like, I would be like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like they're like,
trying to help you, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah! And I'd be like, I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I'm like, I'm a human as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> he was like, nah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Gotta prioritize our members. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was looking around. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, thinking- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - What fucking members? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Who? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's you and me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, there is no line here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There is no line. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's no line of people
waiting to come up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know for a fact, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because after I went in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the casino was like 90% empty! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was just like, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is an asshole being an asshole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and this is like, the only
thing that could beat an asshole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is a Karen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Unstoppable force beats
an immovable object. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You know those YouTube videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where they're like, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just like, bribe your way into everything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah yeah yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, oh you want an
upgrade at a hotel room? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just slip the person 50 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've always thought
about stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I'm like, I'd love to be able to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have the slickness and the coolness </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to pull that shit off, but
I'm just thinking like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> how do I discreetly just
give you like, 10 pounds? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> In a way that like, doesn't
make me look fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, what if
you say no to me? Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, "Aw, gimme a second." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just pull out a 10 note. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Can I come in? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Please?
- Please? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, can I come in now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, surely I would have to preemptively </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> give him some money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And at that point, what if no
one else paid money to get in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm the asshole
who gave him 10 pounds? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And alternatively, what if
you go to like that whole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I see all those fucking TikToks of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just give your hotel
check-in person 50 bucks! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, it's like, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what if the hotel's just actually full? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you actually just gave them $50 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're a dickhead? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen that before though! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Where like, I saw a guy at like a club </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or like a bar or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did like the whole dickhead, being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> pulls out a 20 and like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> puts it into the bouncer's, like, pocket. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the bouncer looks at it and he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, gimme a second, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna go talk to
the manager about it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And he goes in, he
comes out and he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Sorry, we're full." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then everyone in the
line just starts laughing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being like, what a dickhead! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen it work and not work. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen like ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When it doesn't work, it's hilarious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But to me it's like, all right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the benefits don't outweigh
the absolute humility </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of getting rejected, trying
to offer money to someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to get into something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's like you not only lost money, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you also didn't get what you wanted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah yeah.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's some people who like have the, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I think they have the personality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that matches up to that kind of behavior. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not slick at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I cannot do this stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I've been with
guys who are just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Let's come to a solution," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they like,
fucking give the 10 bucks- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you mean Jan? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I was like, just
say Jan. Just say Jan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've not seen Jan do it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I bet Jan would do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, not unless like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Jan has the energy that
he could pull it off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, Jan has the energy
he can pull it off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without ever getting his wallet out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah but Jan would- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's just like, let's talk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jan would do it, get rejected, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then not care that he was rejected. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> He'd just be like, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll go somewhere else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But to me it's like, that's
crushing embarrassing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I can't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what? If you tell me it's full, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't have a magical Karen that appears </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to sort it out for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't have like, Karen's not my, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't have like a- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like a cool Karen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't have like a
stand I can pull out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like, Karen! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't have a Karen to
come out and help me, so, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess I'm done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah 'cause like ... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd just go for tryna
be a clown a little bit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe they'll feel
like, oh that was funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll let this guy in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I try and like, humor my
way through things, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause-
- It doesn't work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it doesn't work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause the thing about
those bribes that I've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is just like, how do you
know how much to give? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know like, what's the
right amount to bribe someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, if you're tryna get into like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, a Michelin star restaurant, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how that would work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That doesn't make any sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But like a club, if it's a shit club, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe you just give
'em like, I don't know- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] I've got six pence. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I want two drinks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe people who do this often know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's a system. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's like a tier list, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, maybe they can
explain it to me how it works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Based on like, how nice or
expensive the drinks are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, I've never heard of being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rejected from a casino though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's, only like drunk
people get rejected </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> from casinos normally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Were you tipsy, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was not tipsy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like Garnt's telling the story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> meanwhile he was like, two bottles deep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He was like Wolf of Wall Street, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like fucking crawling up to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's how I remember it at least! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure it came out as just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hello, my name is Garnt Maneetapho </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I would like to
enter this establishment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And meanwhile, (groans incoherently). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just flew in from Japan! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well you said you had to
take Sydney home, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So odds are you probably,
even if you did drink, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you probably would have
fucking sobered out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He had to take Sydney home, so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was a good night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We went to the casino. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It was a happy end to the story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was the one time in my life that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seeing someone go full Karen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was impressive, and it
actually worked as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Damn. Not that I would
ever have the balls </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to do it myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I was just standing there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was just, I was impressed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what everyone needs, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you don't need to be a Karen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You just need to know a Karen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's all you need. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> You just need that one
mate who will be there- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Karens are bad, except
for when they work for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Karens suck, unless you can tell them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to do something that you
want to get out of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, no no no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Karens suck unless the
manager or the person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is being an equal asshole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Exactly, yeah. Agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like you know, like normally
I don't advocate for this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Because you know, service
people go through enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Service people go through- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I see videos of people like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> arguing at McDonald's,
asking for free food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, what happened at
birth that you became like this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, how were you dropped hard enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to go to a McDonald's and like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> berate a 14-year-old kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're just like, being
a brat about it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like they're probably a
brat their entire life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - There are only very few points, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and some, and then like yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if the service person is
being an asshole, yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You should be a Karen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though I still don't have it in me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> even if they are being an asshole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> There have been plenty
of points where I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I should go full Karen, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because there have been
plenty of points where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have been the assholes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm totally within my
rights to go full Karen, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but like, it's just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just so hard man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Luckily Google reviews exist, so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean you know, like
that fucker who ordered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the 20 B-52s, I would
have loved to have like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> snapped back at him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I just, I couldn't, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't have the balls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or when they tell you
that you get charged </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> $4000 to change your ticket. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] It's so stupid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Absolute, absolute (indistinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, bottom line, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just don't be a Karen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just know a Karen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I activate my stan! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Karen! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, that's what you can do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If the bouncer is like,
being a dickhead to you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just be like, "Oh, you're approaching me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Karen!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Oh my god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Karens are just real stans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Standing here, I realize! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Shut the fuck up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Get an ergonomic keyboard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can get a Karen, I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then you can tell her when to shut up. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because they support us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Unless they know the
exact point to be a Karen. </SPEAKER_04>

Karen mode that activates. </SPEAKER_04>
