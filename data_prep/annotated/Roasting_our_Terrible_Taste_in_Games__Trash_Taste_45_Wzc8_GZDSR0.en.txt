<SPEAKER_02> the amount of blisters i've gotten from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mario party man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah my god whoever designed the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah like he just hated humanity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he woke up and he chose violence </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gamers welcome to this very special </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episode of trash taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm your host for today gamer and with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me is gamers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and gamers how are you doing gamers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it wasn't that funny god says gamer man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that was just the most forceful gamers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like oh [ __ ] as a gamer i was not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> prepared for that's the game when you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> not prepared </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so we all play video games yeah gamers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought today that we could talk about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> our tastes in gaming because i think we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> spoke about what we like to play and all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that but we haven't actually sat down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> reviewed each other's gaming properly or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> at least tell each other our gaming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so we've had like the anime episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where we've probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> broken down our anime tastes even though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've talked about anime before and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're gonna be doing something similar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> today so we have made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three three by threes for our games we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't unfortunately we don't have a my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gaming list </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which probably would have made it not a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing i don't know that should be a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing oh i'm sure there's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm sure there's a thing of that but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just not i don't know it's just not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as prevalent in the gaming community i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like i guess it's because it takes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> longer to finish a game yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and it i'm going to be honest it made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this a lot harder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because i couldn't remember like most of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the games i played </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> literally it's just proven </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i'm not looking forward to this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> episode because i'm probably going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have the most boring gaming taste well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i've got godzilla's just going to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the top top selling games of all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's it we sports nine times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> tetris </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we sport like for me like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we were making our three by threes at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same time these two finished within </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 10 minutes and i after about half an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hour i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> made six and i'm just like are there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> nine games i really care about i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i know i finished nine years nine games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that you care about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what are you gonna have a personal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> retirement home like no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's more than nine games no i i have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> games that i played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i enjoyed but like games that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> really meant something to me or games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i think back and have like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> positive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right just like you just think yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hated it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every game of time now i didn't enjoy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there were just so many games where i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just like yeah it was a game i played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know like my father please stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> giving me shitty games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't want to play any shitty games i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoyed my time with it i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm excited for this one because i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that you know with anime you guys are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like definitely the resident experts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right i feel like gaming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like this is yeah they're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the reverse the the roles have been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> reversed i mean look if there's anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we know about the gaming communities </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> love to [ __ ] on other people's opinions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i feel like regardless of what we put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on here there's going to be at least one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> person being like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> an amateur [ __ ] normies right here oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely definitely i'm independence </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i mean i'm fully prepared for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm fully </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i fully realize i'm a normie when it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comes to games so i'm okay with that to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> be nice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you think you're a normie i think i am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the most normie gamer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of your time considering the the list of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> games that i've actually completed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like i can probably count on my hand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wait why why do you not complete games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't i find it super super hard to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> complete games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it needs to be like really good no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the thing that's the thing most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the get like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i tried to find the criteria of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what i would put on my list right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and for anime it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime that i have at least re-watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> once for gaming i was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um if i complete that if i complete the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game then that's like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> s-tier game in my eyes because if if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's if if i get to the end of the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it must be a truly special imagine if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people did this for like movies they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a good movie if i get to the end </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because like for me for me like the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most of most games i get to that 70 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mark of completion right and at the 70 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mark it's like you've you've discovered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most of the things the game can do for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you right and like you've unlocked most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of the abilities </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like they literally don't end until they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> end like like which games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on your list or just some of my games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> talking about like like online games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well if you're doing story games you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know obviously you can't just quit 70 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> percent of the way and be like i've seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the story i mean like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd be surprised that's not a story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's a [ __ ] dictionary </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know unusual knowledge yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why i think for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um story's a massive thing because if it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't have a good story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i ain't finishing the game no i agree </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with that if i don't have good gameplay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i ain't even starting the game and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like i realize i'm such a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> picky gamer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wait if there's if there is just one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> aspect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of a game that just doesn't mesh with me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> immediately then i just end up not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> playing it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is anything that annoys me more than a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> picky eater it's a picky game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your game especially especially now when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i just don't have time to play games if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm playing a game i play like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think i play one or two games a year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right new games like it's hard not to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just go back to my comfort food and play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> games i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> played before i have such a bad habit on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that where if there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever like a new game that just comes out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it doesn't matter if i just started a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> new game three days prior </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's be like i don't want to play with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you anymore and then i just play that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> new like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so just three days ago as i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> recording this the monster hunter game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> came out right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i was like well i was gonna play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that anyway so it's fine but i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really busy up until these last three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> days so i only just picked it up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yesterday right but before that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like right before monster hunter came </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out i had got the new super mario </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game as well so i had played that new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> super mario game for like literally four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> days </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then i was like monster hunters out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> alright ceo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i just immediately started a new game i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean if it's like a really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know a highly anticipated game that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you're waiting for yeah i get it oh no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i'm like that with anything right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if there's like a new game on like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> steam that's like oh it's 20 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> off i guess i'll give it a go like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like i'm one of those like if if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're comparing it to like people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> eat food right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm definitely one of those people who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just takes little bits off of the buffet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but doesn't actually finish what's on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> their plate yeah before they go into it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whereas there are some people who are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm getting one thing and i'm not gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> move on to the next meal until i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> finished it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay so you know when it was like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> in your life okay well then you want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go through the nine games you have all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> starting at the top mass effect 3 tales </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of symphonia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> persona 5 zelda wind waker liga legends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> super mario sunshine metal gear solid 3 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> subnautica gears of war 2. i look at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this and i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this is the most random [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game not expecting like half of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> games you put on here i honestly i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> expected myself to put more anime games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on and i'm just realizing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what i haven't really finished any games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean the only real anime games on here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> symphonia and persona right yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> those are the only like i'm thinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what other anime type game series are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> uh that are famous because when i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of anime video games i'm just like tail </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> series persona series yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh those are the only anime video games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i got like 20 something hours in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and i was like wow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 20 hours into a jlpg yeah that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> impressive i was like this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so boring literally like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> all the fights of the [ __ ] stuff yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> welcome to jrpg </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like i'm completely okay so here's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the thing for the longest time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've really really tried to get into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> jrpgs like as a kid the reason the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason tales is on here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is that as a kid i like i knew i would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> love jrpgs and like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> aesthetic and the story and everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i love anime yeah the problem is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i hated turn-based battles like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i couldn't [ __ ] stand turn-based </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> battles and that would like put me off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting more than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> say five hours into any jrpg because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would just get turned off by the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> turn-based battles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so i was like as a kid i was waiting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for a game that was an anime game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that just did not have a turn-based </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> battle system and also random encounters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] hate random encounters as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wait wait okay you say that though but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> persona 5 is literally that i know okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> persona 5 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't have random encounters but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> persona 5 is literally the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that broke jrpgs for me because i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even as someone who hasn't played it or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> plays jrpgs it's still that grpg that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> look at and i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i know that's a good game like i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> need to play it to know that's a good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing yeah yeah you just look at it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i won't play it but yeah yeah like i can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see everything about it that this is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> banger of a game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not gonna play it because i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> own a console that can play it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly do i want to get into that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no but it's like a [ __ ] good game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with persona 5 um i don't know it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the only turn-based battle game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where i just didn't get bored of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> battle system and i don't know why it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something i think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the theme man it's it's it's it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bit of everything right because it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's really good at tricking your mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into thinking that this isn't turn-based </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> battle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's the best way i can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> describe which is like the sexiest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> animations alive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah it's just got like so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> many colors the music [ __ ] slaps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um you can like you get different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> abilities as you go on and i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's it's something it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really good at tricking your mind into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thinking man this is this just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just feels almost like a rhythm game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a point right right you know it's it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's i i can't put my words on why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that battle system out of everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> trumped any other jrpg battle system um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can't think of any other jrpg i enjoy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though i even i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i say i'm a jrpg enjoyer right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i have the most basics so then why did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you put tales of symphonia there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> specifically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tales of symphonia okay so because for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> me if i would have put a tails gate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i've played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most of the tales games i played one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> tales game i don't know what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was happening so if you want to explain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me what it's about because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> legitimately don't know anything i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure the viewers who haven't played it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because if i were to put a tales game on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there personally i would have put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> zysteria on there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah which one's exterior again series </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the one after symphonia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> okay i would have put uh the only one i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can think of is vesperia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah which is which is like i'm just i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just throwing out words for connor here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they all sound so similar already </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mysterious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean it's like final fantasy one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two three four i can follow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean i mean the best way i can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> describe it it's just basically uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just basically anime as anime the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> video game like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's really that simple jrpgs are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i know i can get into most grpgs if i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the combat and battle system </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's just anime the video game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and i like anime i'm a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weeb </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> therefore equation equals you like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tail series yeah yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and um the reason tells of symphonia one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was it was my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first experience with just realizing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whoa you can play a video game and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feels like you're watching an anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well this is this is amazing what's up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i can't i can't believe i've just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> discovered this in my life and i was so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obsessed with this right because it's um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> these are two of the only jrpgs i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever finished but i was so obsessed with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i got to the 80 point as i do with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most video games and then i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stopped playing it and i didn't stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> playing it because i got bored </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i stopped playing it because i didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want that experience to end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't i didn't want to see the end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> credits and know that that experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is over yeah so like i stopped playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it for about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i held on to that for about two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of my life just just just so just so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i have i have the ending of tales </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of symphonia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to look forward to in my life like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was that was like the peak of life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off after this you must go to hold a nut </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you literally blue ball </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that monk controller kicking in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the funny thing is so i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after after about two years i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> okay i think it's time to complete tales </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of some phonemes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> start playing it's time to not yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think it's time to finally not start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> playing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> start playing it again and then i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realize [ __ ] i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything i can't remember anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's going on yeah so what did i do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i just replayed it from the beginning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i was like 80 hours in already </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um so i put like a good 150 160 hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into this game yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um persona 5 i actually haven't replayed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay because it's quite long it's quite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a long time it's quite a long game and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to tales when i was a kid i had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plenty of time to [ __ ] replay games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> back then because i assume persona is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably on your list as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because you yeah oh i've played persona </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 5 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> four times you've played it more than me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember the reason persona's on there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that out of like a lot of games in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> adult life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it like for the first time in a long </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it felt like i was a kid again and i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh how how can i how can i put this into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> words when i experienced persona 5 i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i could feel this way just just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being really excited about just being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really excited about a game and just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> discovering in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this new world and uh god i i killed my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> feelings when i was an adult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and the person five reminded me it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really did it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know it was i was just like yo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is anime and it's a video game i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> enjoying it again it's it's like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like discovering anime for the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> time again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right right and yeah like i i i always i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone always told me you know you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the soda series you're like sony </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> series and i'm just like not a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> word it's got turn-based battles in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there why the [ __ ] would i like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's got turn-based battles and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they are like the worst system of any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> combat system in any game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's like far and beyond one of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> few things i can agree on donkey with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right you know and that's that's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the big reason why i haven't you know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i couldn't get into a lot of the final </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> fantasies never played final fantasy 7. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um i'll probably start playing final </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fantasy 7 remake because that doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> have turn-based battles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i was telling myself i was going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to play final fantasy 7 for like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> past 10 years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's one of those games like i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> going to play it yeah of course i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to play it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well i mean yeah the time passed yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i mean i remember i did boot up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> final fantasy 7 and the first time i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on steam and i was like oh the place is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the original one yeah i'm like yeah oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's hideous yeah it looks like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> absolute [ __ ] i can't do this like cloud </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with like the egg beat of hands </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah it looks [ __ ] horrible now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you talked about you know when a new </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hype game comes out then you just drop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever you're playing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just start playing that i have like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the opposite problem i have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i don't know what i don't know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there's an actual term for it i think i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think i'm gonna i'm just gonna coin a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> term now yeah i get hype fatigue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right so so like there are times when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i see a new game like announced at e3 or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something yeah i see all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i see all like the you know the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gameplay and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the developers showing off gameplay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> footage and trailers and i'm like i like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> follow through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i'm like super super hyped for this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> game because i think i'm really really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna like this game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i get so hype that i kind of hype </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of it once the game actually comes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> out like i used all your hype </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> weird like i was like that with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> final fantasy 7 remake </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i'm like dude i can finally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enjoy final fantasy 7 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's removed the shitty part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i hate about final fantasy the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> turn-based combat and the random </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> encounters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so in theory i should love this game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because this is one of the greatest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> jrpgs of all time everyone always talks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was hyped for it to come out i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hyped for it for years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it came out and then i just was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like maybe i'll play it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a really good point i think that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> league of legends killed my ability </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get hyped for games yeah because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> knew that at the end of the day most of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the time i would just return to league </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of legends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah so it didn't matter what game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> came out anyway because i would play it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for a week and i'd be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right back to league yeah it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though i don't really play league </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anymore even when a game that i probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> am excited for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like is announced or whatever i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like while someone's on twitter going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through you know like the [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean yeah it's like you know when it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> comes it's kind of like that you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whole thing of like oh like a new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurant just opened up that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's [ __ ] knives about i'll go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> check it out but then you go have a meal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there it might be the best [ __ ] meal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of your life but then you know you'll be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right i'm going to mcdonald's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tomorrow it's just it's just comfort </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> food right or comfort game yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like there's always that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fallback of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you know this is a cool game and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all yeah like i'm sure i'll love it if i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just kept going on with it yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but at the same time it's like i'll i'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just replay this thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i wonder as well if you're into story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> games more which i think the people who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are chasing like the hype are more into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> story games because when you're a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> multiplayer gamer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah mainly like me it's like well i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just gonna keep playing the same [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so like why would i get hyped over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything when if there's a new game i'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably end up switching to it if it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a new multiplayer game yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so it's kind of hard for me to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hacked about because it's like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> catch-22 for me right because i i really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> value good stories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in video games but also like especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now as an adult i think i just have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> commitment issues with games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like unless i know that i'm going to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> committed to this game for the next week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of my life which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> finding heart finding time to commit to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a game for the next week of my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like a big [ __ ] commitment now it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is it is so hard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that sometimes i just go back to my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comfort food of just like maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> replaying massive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when when cyberpunk got released i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was super super hyped about cyberpunk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it got released and then i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like i don't really feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> playing cyberphone i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i just started playing mass effect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like you might choose your dick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> size in mass effect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i know the story of mass effect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i know i'm going to enjoy the story of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mass effect and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i know but i i think over like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pre-overexposure in terms of like gaming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is a big thing for me because a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people hype up games to know to no end </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't think that people i don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in anime at least this is as big of a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or as big of like a thing where people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you know people get hyped about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime as it's airing people rarely get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hyped about anime or super super hyped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about anime before it starts airing but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with video games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have years and years to like pump </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yourself up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for this game cyberpunk hyping up right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it was ridiculous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i am surprised though that i wasn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expecting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i thought i was gonna be the only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> nintendo simp on this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at this table so i'm glad that you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> at least like a couple of nintendo games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> here okay okay okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so let me ask you this was wind wake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> your first zelda </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was the first zelda that i finished </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's normally how it goes yeah that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> usually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> cause my favorite was like twilight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> princess and i know that it's not the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> best one because i think breath of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wild is better than twilight princess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but twilight prince is still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so yeah but i saw a game but it's only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because i like i think that was the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first one that i finished </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like when you finish a zelda game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's something about it that feels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah yeah you're a kid yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean i i it was like really hard for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to pick between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wind waker and uh breath of the wild i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was [ __ ] obsessed with breath of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wild when i when it came out because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i started getting into breath of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the wild um was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first time that i came to japan with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sydney the first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first time i met you um and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i had a great time in japan first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time in japan of course you can have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> great [ __ ] time but i remember no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> matter how many times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no matter how many times i went to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> archibald no matter how many times we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hung out and everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the back of my mind i was just like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of just want to go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i could be playing breath of the wild </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like i'm just like you know [ __ ] joey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man like oh come on come on joey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're good but are you breath of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> wild dude i don't know about that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could have said that to my face i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would have been like you know what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> ain't mad i kind of agree </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't have to agree with you there to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> be fair though i wasn't expecting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sunshine for some reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay out of all you don't seem like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sunshine player why don't i seem like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sunshine no i don't know you just don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you two don't seem like nintendo game i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know i know you're not but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you definitely don't seem like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> uh the only re the the only nintendo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> games out on here are like my childhood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> nintendo games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah because i was definitely a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nintendo kid i i was such nintendo simp </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i was a kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i i was like i i didn't i never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> owned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any other console apart from the nes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> super nest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> n64 gamecube and it was only after </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gamecube that i finally ventured out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is why i just didn't own a wii </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and i think since then the switch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the first nintendo console i actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> owned right and so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i still i still like out of all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> nintendo games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these two pop outs me as the ones that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> think they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the most popular honestly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like most popular 3d mario and most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> popular 3d zelda </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i think wind waker is great i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ah you could you could pick wind waker </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or breath the wild as number one and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'd be i you know i can't hate on both </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right because i mean at the end of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> day but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a lot of people who grew up my age </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they put ocarina of time and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i you know i i'm not gonna lie i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understand the hype </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no i played okay okay i thought no i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of got bored of ocarina of time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like i kind of did it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like how like i think wind waker </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again it's like the art style right when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wicket aged [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fantastically mm-hmm ocarina did not age </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you played that [ __ ] now it is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] impossible to play </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i've always said like ocarina of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time for the zelda franchise is a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like final fantasy 7 for the final </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fantasy franchise where it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was the first 3d game yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after a long succession of 2d games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously when the 3d like [ __ ] was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> starting right it was impressive right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so people immediately were like it's in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 3d yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> automatically 10 out of 10. i also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't grow up with it so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i i ended up playing it later </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even like now right to me when i you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know who i've played all the games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from wind waker onwards i just think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when i'm looking at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ocarina of time like you know majora's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> mess looks so much more interesting oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah in like every single way this game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> looks [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> weird i agree yeah it's so cool but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have you ever played majora's mask </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i did like about two hours and then i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like [ __ ] this is so hard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> mcdonald's lasts as hard as [ __ ] it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> really hard no i would 100 prefer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> playing majora's mask over ocarina of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time just because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> again like it's well i mean for for one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> both are hard as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's not like playing it on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> emulator i don't know why someone feels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wrong about playing nintendo 64. yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because i have majora's mask </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on like because i have like a proper </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> ncaa yeah i know you and i have majora's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mask </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and it's like i don't know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feeling is kind of the same to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i don't know maybe it's like yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> want to go back and play them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah but again like i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> understand people who are like ocarina </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of time is the greatest zelda game i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i'm sorry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not it's not it hasn't i'm going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get a whole lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> about this but it's the look i've i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> publicly said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that yeah i'm sorry but final fantasy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> vii is not the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again it's what combo bebop is to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> animate right it's like it's the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what it is that's what it is it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's the one you probably watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> first it's the one that probably got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you into the franchise or yeah to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> medium right yeah but that doesn't mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the best yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i agree because these might be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the ones from my childhood that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i have the fondest memories of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they weren't the first zelda or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mario that i played in my life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm surprised you didn't have uh super </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mario 64 on there because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you're such a boomer these aren't boomer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> pics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where are your boomer pigs these are way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> too neat because the thing is i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> super massive mario fan i i did you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i have i have completed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 64 completed sunshine completed what's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the most recent mario game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> honestly honestly i mean i completed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them not got all the shiny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shines or you know but i got to the end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game beat bowser the final time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah um so you know i have completed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> them but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out of all the marios that i've played </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i just think there's something about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sunshine you know you know when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think back to a game and it just it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> vibes with you like like look the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> feeling just vibes yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's sunshine i feel like sunshine is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just clean okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's literally in the name sunshine okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you couldn't tell i'm a bit of a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> summer kid right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean we've had many arguments about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this where like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] does that does that mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything though it does just because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the winter i'm not gonna go get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mario at the [ __ ] winter olympics all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right he's playing he's playing [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mario 64 gets to the snow level turns it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no no that is exactly what happens </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys call me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you know there are some levels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out there where you you hit you hit her </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> oh it's this level again like every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] water level in any [ __ ] video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> game of all time but i'm not like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] you know what's one thing i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hate about the stage the weather i've </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> like what's wrong with you no like when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i played mario sunshine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like i i loved it because every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> level is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every level gives off that summer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feeling and that summer vibe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which i [ __ ] love yeah and it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the the ones i hated the levels that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hated the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in mario sunshine were like the boo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> levels something where it's like dark </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scary level [ __ ] yeah the pachinko </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> level is the [ __ ] one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah but like for the most part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it gives off a very summery vibe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think back to that i'm just like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i [ __ ] with this i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it just makes me happy it gives me the </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> it is the first multiplayer game that's </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> and i'm just like matt gears of war was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a good [ __ ] online game no dude it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was clean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and honestly gears of war 2 was </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> just like i didn't give a [ __ ] about the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> story i didn't understand there's one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> thing i remember about geez award too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the story the story is so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember this again it doesn't count </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as spoilers anymore it's so [ __ ] old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah what's the story again um the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> locusts are taking over the earth and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're basically stopping them etc etc </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean that's basically like the wow no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because there was like the there were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the two duo who you're following which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i just remember one guy trying to look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for his wife or something that was the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sad part </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then he like finds it but then he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't find it it was like an illusion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then i'm like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like i was like 13. i was like i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this [ __ ] massive lead hit of a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> character just like breaks down in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> battlefield i'm just like oh my god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was just like this is the first game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i'm just like oh chainsaw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's how it gets you in right so giza </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> will get you in with the chainsaw go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bruh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> super manly men and then 10 minutes in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're [ __ ] crying and you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> whoa what's happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no no for me the one memory i hold for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> gears of war two the multiplayer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just the sound you the sound it makes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when you pop a guy's head off with a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sniper like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i played two yeah like that was i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think that soul </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sound and i don't know why it was so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] satisfying because it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like literally cracking an egg </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well i mean those those those shotguns </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> are like still there's like no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> multiplayer experience like the online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and gears of war </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just shotguns yeah yeah yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like the meta it's like you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to run up to people and shotgun each </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> other yeah right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay the shotgun was also really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> satisfying when you got like a point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> blank and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the body just explodes yeah my god like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you're the monkey brain but that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was like the first time i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay i i i enjoy this now this is fun uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was really sex i think uh gears of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> war got plagued by the fact that there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was just like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like uh there would always be like uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two really [ __ ] god tier </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> players in the game that could just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dominate the whole lobby yeah so it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of became </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not fun after a while if you weren't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like a pro yeah you just get [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> destroyed by the like good players i def </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't play on i didn't play online </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> gears of war two a lot because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i didn't know what console was it on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> again 360. three years because i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> own a 360 because yeah i played at my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> friend's place a lot just like land </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> multiplayer and that was like really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really fun but yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i probably from the sounds of it i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably wouldn't enjoy it online </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no you probably wouldn't now i mean it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was me discovering </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what multiplayer meant and before i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> started hating okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gears of war started my love for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> multiplayer games league of legends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> killed it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> okay league of legends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is in the middle because i think out of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out out of all these games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i have probably played league of legends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the most right not proud to admit it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um but the reason it's on there is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the honeymoon period of league of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> legends for me was probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the best gaming experience of my life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really long for me as well i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like two years long that's a long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> honeymoon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> dude when you get into that game and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's going well it feels so fun yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's great it's so fun to get into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just it's hard yeah because the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> problem is now i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> multiplayer games just aren't fun unless </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you are getting into it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> immediately as it's released right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the problem the problem with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> multiplayer games i found now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that you have a new game and that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when a new game just gets released </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the fun part because nobody </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nobody really knows how to be good at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's just kind of like really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> discovering what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> works and what doesn't everyone's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] having fun yeah and then you get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to a point in multiplayer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where people just realize how to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> optimize the fun out of the game the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sweaty boys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what happened with like fortnight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> honestly like honestly like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me all memes aside fortnight was so fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when it first came out yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it blew up and then when i got to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> point where everyone would like build a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] mortgage right in front of your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> eyes within 10 seconds and you couldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> do anything it's like well this is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not fun anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't have the dexterity of like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> chimp on cr on like coke right like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how am i supposed to do this yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i remember like i really really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] enjoyed overwatch when it first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> came out yeah me too like i i i never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wrote i i didn't make the same mistake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of trying to do ranked um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because because i'd learned from league </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of legends but even just playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> casually i really really [ __ ] enjoyed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they got to a point when even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in casual games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you weren't allowed to have fun anymore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you got this the same the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh the same heroes exchange of hanzo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i i i would fully admit i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a genji main because i was a dirty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> leaf </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the reason i played genji was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i [ __ ] sucked at genji </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like the one the one time out of ten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where i i didn't alt and it actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worked out that was the reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i played genji like nine out of ten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> times i would completely flunk it i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would fail i would get killed straight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that one time that one time when it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worked out i that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that that's what i lived for man and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because of that i was one of the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i wasn't the most toxic ones but i was i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was that one genji on your team </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that probably threw you the magic i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i was that person did you talk [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to your teammates </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't talk i'm not a toxic gamer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> funnily enough i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh come on guys we can do it if we are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all put together </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we can win with the power of friendship </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> come on guys oh my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and ranked you had to get to start like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shouting at people get them to shut up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like i'm just like that guy who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just goes mutual and just does my own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i do that sometimes too i mean i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> play it as closely as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a single-player game as i can because um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like playing online game just makes me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> makes you realize how [ __ ] how much i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hate people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> people are the worst especially in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> competitive ones right that's why like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but in japan it's so weird because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> people just don't smack talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at all they don't know how to yeah they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> should like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and most you'll get passive aggression </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like i'd probably i'd probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoy japanese comparison </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no one talks unless you talk to them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i play in the league servers in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like ninety percent of them are just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chinese smurfs yeah so of course they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like toxic as [ __ ] you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so i don't really play anymore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's just like you can't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> have fun in league of legends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just like a korean chinese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> playground but they're like oh let's go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] with the japanese players who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> are suck at this game yeah it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's literally it's just the playground </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where the school bullies go to to just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like bully like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just like lebron james coming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> down to the elementary match </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to start dunking you know you feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you suck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> metal gear whatever i mean that's good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't what can i say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah no one can complain about that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> mean you could put any metal gear in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there it would have been good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean for me like do you know do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know the reason i enjoyed metal gear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why because i i've played all metal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> gears it's in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> except for metal gear five really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> apparently the best one in terms of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gameplay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it is the best one i have really no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of once to play it exclusive the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> hype fatigue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no no no no okay i get it you feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you had your film no i i didn't have my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like i was hype as [ __ ] for it and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then what is it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then i found out that the story was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like incomplete and i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well that that that just takes the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> reason absolutely middle gear absolutely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> more incomplete by not playing it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah that doesn't make any sense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's not finished and i haven't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> finished it so i'm not gonna do any more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't deserve my time okay like how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how do you feel about this connor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like when you play have you ever played </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> metal gear uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no okay none of them uh no because i it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know why but like i never really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saw it in like the shops </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably because it was also on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> playstation as well right i had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> playstation 2 growing up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right but yeah for some reason i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably playing like shrek and spyro </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and damn [ __ ] like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good choice i was really like yeah when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was uh when i was younger i wasn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> attracted at all to like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fps art or like the like military </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looking stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right i always went for the childish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cartoonish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah even when i was like 14 15 i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would still like to prefer the cartoon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime style over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so i i normally avoided those so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was playing like [ __ ] theme park </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> games and [ __ ] when i was like 15. like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rollercoaster tycooning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well playstation had its like uh its own </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> brand of like these theme park games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and i think they're still quite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> popular on youtube occasionally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you could like you could build the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rides and ride them from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like pov first person oh wow it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really cool [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> do you know what i'm on about no no i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just getting a flashback of memories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe i should have put that on there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i've spent far too much time on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> theme park or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah theme park and theme hospital yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i i think you know roller coaster </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tycoon is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i'm just like [ __ ] man maybe i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should have put that on my list but uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah in terms of like i never got got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into the roller coaster tycoon because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh theme park had like the voiced person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> telling you what to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i don't know something about having </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone voiced telling you what to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was was a big selling point for me was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that the one the playstation 2 that i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> on about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe i don't know i don't know i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> know when we have a break </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but it definitely had a pov option </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you could build the rides and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because you could ride it yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> could and there's like racing games in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it so when you built like the racing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> track you built the track yourself and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then you could race around it oh that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sounds cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah dude it was awesome why am i never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> heard of this and then like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you could [ __ ] i want to play it now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was like the the normal park there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was like an alien park </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you remember this and each each </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> world had like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different ride things that you could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ride and like you you couldn't progress </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the next world unless your theme park </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was x successful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just sounds like rollercoaster </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tycoon it is like tycoon but like better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like rollercoaster tycoon is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> pure like top down yeah it's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get in there you can walk around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your path </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah this is the box art i'm going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> find it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i know what the box art looks like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think they released other types of games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well but this is the one that like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> played to death in the ps2 no i you you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you are reminding me now and i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just like [ __ ] i didn't play on ps2 i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> played it on pc </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was on pc as well yeah yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was on pc um [ __ ] man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nostalgia no because i i [ __ ] loved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> simulator games like that i can i could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never get to the sims but i [ __ ] love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sim city theme hospital um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rollercoaster tycoon not very close to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tycoon uh theme park as you said yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> god i put so much just hit him with that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nostalgia oh this is yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that's why i like i never really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> played military games because i would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> always see like the like the bright </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> light boxes and i think i'm like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know being a [ __ ] 14 15 year old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no i was exactly the same when like uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when like heavy rain came </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out yeah and i looked at the box and i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what the [ __ ] is that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and now i regret not playing it back in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the day because much many years later </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i was like this game's [ __ ] fantastic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like i loved like crash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> bandicoot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so much on the ps2 yeah and like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was the kind of art style that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> normally gravitated towards so wow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right right like there's so many games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've like yeah even all the spin-offs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are crash bandicoot yeah like crash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> racing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh they had like the mario party s kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of game called like crash bash which i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> really liked as well i've heard of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though it's a terrible game right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> now but i used to play it a bunch and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> crash one two and you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the only racing game that could legit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> compete against mario kart </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no no no no no uh what was the uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> did he congratulations diddy kong racing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is up there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come on really it is up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the n64 version because that was when it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could actually compete with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> well it was made by rare right yeah you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know i could see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i remember like 10 year old me going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my friend's place and he had diddy kong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> racing on near n64 and i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> wait you can ride on aeroplanes yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like boats what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like for me i was really close </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> putting banjo-kazooie on here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's good it's good what can i say and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh yeah i don't know like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay so part like a big reason why that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i had so few games to pick up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to pick from right is because when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really get into game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i really get into a game i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wring out as much content as i can out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of that game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every side quest every little piece of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dialogue i play it to death so i can get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything like with let's say so with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> metal gear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right so there would be times where you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you familiar with the codec calls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they would like call you up and be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah snake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah exactly so so one one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> big criticisms of metal gear when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know i was playing it and you know when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like really really big was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people hated the cut scenes how long the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cut scenes were people hated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the fact that you had to go through all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these codec calls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i [ __ ] love that [ __ ] man i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like holy [ __ ] there's an hour cut </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> scene be right back getting the popcorn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the most epic gameplay i could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ever hope for was metal gears </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three the one with like psycho mantis is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that the one it was that was the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one that was a photo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah the first one was like the top down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nes one i don't know i mean that's metal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gear that's metal gear not metal gear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> solid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> solid yeah yeah yeah because like every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> time i watch because i've watched tons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> videos about metal gear and every time i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch it i'm like [ __ ] i wish i got this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when i was a kid because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it looks badass it was [ __ ] badass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and but the thing the thing is like okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so there's metal gear and there's tails </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> as well tails has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this feature right i mean you play the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tails game yeah how did you think about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the skits feature </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or skits what was that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> okay oh wait is this what you talk with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the character and like the fire emblem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what wait what where you interact with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> characters no am i crazy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of so in intel's games they have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this thing called </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> skits right where you'll be walking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around and then you press like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> select button when they give you a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> prompt right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it would just be characters talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to each other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah i'd never i'd always see this i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so like i was probably the one [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who just hit every skit button like i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't care what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what time i'm in what like at which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> point of the story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i would just like i literally played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tails and i literally like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are some skits that are only that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that only happen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at certain areas of the map which are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like some areas of the map you literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to walk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the other side of the map and there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was no like quick well this is a big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> boulder huh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it sure is it literally doesn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean [ __ ] yeah and it literally doesn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> mean [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i [ __ ] love that feature i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> man i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like because here's the if i love the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> characters and i love the world i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm getting every kind of like i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting kind of interacting with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> same thing with mass effect when people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talk about how much they love mass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> effect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they talk about oh you know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> character writing and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know the well not so much the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gameplay anymore but like the world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the characters that uh of mass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> effect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um i was probably i like i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's there was one mass effect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game play session i had where i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally wasted an hour or two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because in mass effects they have this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not a codec function but like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> database function where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they literally have a database of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the history and law of like every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> alien every world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you go to so i literally i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally spent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an hour or two of mass effect going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through the entire database </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just and just reading the whole law </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of mass effect i'd rather not i'd rather </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and i [ __ ] loved it i i absolutely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> loved it um i can't even shake my head </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i used to do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> exact same thing without you guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i want to play a game read a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> book or some [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the [ __ ] i did i did that recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> actually when i played xenoblade 2 for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's this like there's this part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where like every monster you encounter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has like a full page about like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how it lives and [ __ ] yeah i read </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through all of them i'm like oh okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so like the zafaros only lives in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> swamps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like to to me that's that's what really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> makes a video game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's especially because if if i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like really into a video game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm going to find out everything i can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about that video game and that's what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like but the thing there's a difference </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right because i like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's just fed to me in video games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have talked about you know the law of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dark souls and everything like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and people have like figured stuff out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through the subtle hints that you get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through playing the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just like just tell me it just just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah just just give me exposition this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is the one time where i actually want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> exposition </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you say that all i think about is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] um the silent hill person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> who's like um no no sorry so there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like on on silent hill forums </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like where they discuss like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what the game's about and stuff yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like a really big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing and a big like like controversial </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like drama because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of like the main admins who had like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some of the most posts on it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> convinced </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that the main character was circumcised </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was the reason for his like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trauma </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that he was like gay or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and then he was gay because of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so there's this whole like dude like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wang made like a 20 minute video about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like this whole thing where it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like a massive deal on the forum so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're discussing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know is and then the guy was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know he was on like a crusade being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like no one should be circumcised it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> causes trauma and stuff like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it turns like a whole thing and i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like this is what people do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my mind i'm like that's people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> read story that's what they do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they go on forums talk about why the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> main character is gay and his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> circumcision was trauma </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah what's wrong with these people </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> which is funny like i'm more than happy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to watch anime where i'm just like oh </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> trying to say but with gaming i'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like nah no patience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just just give me well because you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> already focused on like actually playing </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> like no no i don't need to like i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> want to like sit here and [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guess what the story is what i'm trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to do this convoluted input right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's there's also another thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that uh also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like it it's gonna be it's gonna sound </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> super weird but sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i hate choice in video games i just want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a linear game which is which is funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that massive yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally the [ __ ] mass effect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally mass effect persona five but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah mass effect and persona five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which are the two like let's say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the two uh most choice heavy games yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> two of the most choice every games and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exceptions the two exceptions to that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rule but i have i have this thing i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know if i'm the only person who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has like gaming fomo where i'm given a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> choice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and and i know that like by by making </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this choice i'm going to miss out on a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> certain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> piece of content oh yeah yeah i hate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i hate that so much right because that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> means that means </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the back of my mind i'm just like but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what if i pick the other choice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and and well that's literally the reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why i replayed persona 5 four times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i was like well there's four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> choices </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and i want to see all of them so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm gonna play it four times to get all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the choices </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i think it's unfortunate that i i like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> swore off jrpgs after playing blue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dragon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not really which i mean i think i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mentioned this before yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah the one that was like i think the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> main selling point that comments were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> saying is that it was uh the art was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> made by the dragon ball uh guy oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> toriyama here yeah and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i never encountered this before in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video game and this is what really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pissed me off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because at this point i was an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> achievement hunter guy so i would always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go in like 100 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i would get all all the achievements no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> matter what yeah this is the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i encountered the thing where i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay so this story's two hours long or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some dumb [ __ ] like that it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ridiculously long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and i did it and then i'm like all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right how do i get these last few </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> achievements and it'd be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this achievement is on the forum would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> say this like this achievement is only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unlockable by doing this one option in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this one mission yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can never get this achievement yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what say suck </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that that's such a jrpg movie and that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they would do that like what kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of sick [ __ ] does that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like i don't want anyone to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> able to get this achievement make them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> play the whole [ __ ] like 200 hour </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> game again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] [ __ ] there's no need to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that why would you do that as a game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> designer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know forget you it's to get you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to replay the game right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean i.e [ __ ] [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everything i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the the reason i hate it is because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it takes it takes enough energy for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to finish a game once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so i'm thinking [ __ ] if i need to replay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this game i'm just not going to see this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> contest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah yeah dude if you want to see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the shitty turn based combat you should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> play blue dragon man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] every time you [ __ ] start a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> battle the [ __ ] the mute the main </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> song starts playing yeah it's a guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] singing it sounds like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pokemon intro </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it takes like 20 seconds of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> animations where they all like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> summon their things which is like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 20 seconds long before you can even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> start the [ __ ] turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't tempt me don't tempt me like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dude i'm excited oh it's [ __ ] garbage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's toriyama dude that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is like right up my alley garbage i also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hate in jrpgs that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they give you these characters and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what if you hate the characters that you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to use </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like in pokemon at least i can swap out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know bulbasaur but like most jrpgs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's you know like especially with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the turn-based ones right it's like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can only have four in the party so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just pick your four favorite characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right well this one it was like you only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have these guys and they were [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> annoying characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so it was like what am i supposed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to [ __ ] do this game sucks oh that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not a good jlpg </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then like one of the main enemies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just a snake coiled in like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the whole joke was that it was a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> piece of [ __ ] and i'm like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that sounds hilarious what it's a piece </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a metaphor for the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm still annoyed about it i completed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it and i loved playing it but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally only played it because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like i bought this game my mum </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> won't buy me another one so i have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> completely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i need to play this now i want you to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> play just so you can like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how did you get that game again so what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was is like you know i don't know if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your game stores had this but in the uk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they had a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> three for 20 pounds pre-owned games oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so i would basically just go to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing and buy three games that looked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and then i would just be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> forced to play them most of the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they were all like super easy and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had an absolute gold like blue dragon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there was like there was like one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> each game and there's a whole [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> shelf of blue dragons just like take him </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> my first time ever having to swap discs </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> ranking it's it's it's a literal ranking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> system </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> just i just got myself on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> leaderboards </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of of fifa that's how i did it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i was just obsessed with the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> game and like everyone started playing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it so i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh i i guess i'll play fifa did you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> demolish everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like your unidorm yeah pretty much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because here's the thing because uh like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> my my group of mates um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and my unidorm uh they were like super </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> super competitive over fifa right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like they were like that in mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this is how you get bragging rights </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was two games it was cod and fifa </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was just to me it was just like fifa </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was not like watching football at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fifa was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the ball goes yeah and um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and yeah i don't know i just got really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> good at it and i don't know how because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um yeah i mean just the british in you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yes well yeah there was two games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i [ __ ] i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i feel like it was one game where i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got good at really unintentionally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was probably the only game i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ever played in my life that i got good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at unintentionally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i don't really like football that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much what's wrong with you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what the [ __ ] is wrong with you i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know 200 in the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i hate this game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the fact is like i had completely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> blanked that from my memory until it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just now yeah full time i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how the [ __ ] did that happen how the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] would i get top 200 in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the um yeah i top 200 in fifa and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i just played it and i just kept </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ranking up and then i just got really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bored </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i stopped playing because and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason i stopped playing was because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i finished uni and i didn't have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason to play it anymore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wow no because i remember now how it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> started because i got the game literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just to blend in with the normies so i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> literally got the game so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i could have something to talk to people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about at parties right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so i'm one of them he literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bought fifa as a social gimmick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah so i started playing it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i could like keep up my mates and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then i just kind of figured out a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meta </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i guess because you know it's football </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone wants to score goals and then i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quickly realized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you just learned how to defend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> correctly and if you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could defend goods you are better than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 90 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of players that ever played that game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because everyone only wants to score </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goals and then so after that so i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so after that then i figured out the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> broken teams and the broken team was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> barcelona </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they were the best team in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> world at the time but then so most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people were picking barcelona </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i realized that there was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> counter to barcelona which was into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> milan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because inter milan had uh zlatan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ibrahimovic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and um he just completely destroyed the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> barcelona defense because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he couldn't be shaken off the ball </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the swedish guy right yeah that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the swedish guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah he in the game he was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> completely [ __ ] broken so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your life here was completely broken so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then once i realized that i just thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i just started like just started beating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all my mates and then i was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what let's just let me let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just limit test myself how far i can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how far can i get up with this and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know i said top 200 earlier i'm not sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if it's top 200 it's up 300 but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the one of the top still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> impressive yeah yeah one one of the top </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> few hundreds in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh in the game at the time um and i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kept i just kept playing until </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i stopped climbing and yeah that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's how far i climbed and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i just casually told one of my one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of my mates that and he's just like have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you ever thought about entering </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> competitions or stuff like that and i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no no i don't think i will because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because uh yeah i just wanted to make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime reviews and watch anime at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> time so i just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> had no interest in playing that game in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> my own in my own time takes off adidas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tracksuit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and uh yeah i just i just remember that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> now so uh i don't know what reminds me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> topic that was like pre the before the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh fifa ultimate team </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> nonsense yeah that was before fifa </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ultimate i don't know what the [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> going on right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so like right now like i think if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you want to have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a legitimate competitive team in fifa </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you need a team </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of a value of around 27 000 real </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> money like dollars jesus that's how much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you on average have to spend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to have an actual like top competitive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> team why so all the pros have spent like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thirty thousand dollars plus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so okay [ __ ] hell okay just just to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> compete this is this is gonna sound so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after everything i've i've just said um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what's fifa ultimate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basically they you know again this is a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> hundred percent like and imagine an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> alien describing how humans converge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've never played this myself but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously i'm a gamer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i like to keep up with games yeah um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but yes so essentially one of those is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> micro transactions like imagine anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because fate you can you go against each </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other in fate like no p </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no no so imagine a pvp fate where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can build a team </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just so happens instead of like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two or three characters it's like a team </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like 11 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or whatever it is i think so it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally fifa gotcha well yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're the ones who like this this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the reason why it started like it got so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bad like because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's literally pay to win it's 100 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pay to win and so like to even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so to be like to be able to compete </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> competitively </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to have it the stacked team to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get the stacked team you spend on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> average like 30 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to even have a chance of getting the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stacked team dude that's that's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so [ __ ] and like you you hear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even the pros </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talk about it like there's interviews </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with them where they're like yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not fun at all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you have to spend this amount of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> money and everyone's playing the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] because everyone has the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> broken [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone yeah yeah it's so [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know we we sit here and complain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about gacha and it's like yeah okay you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the end of the day it is 90 of the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not playing against other people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's where it starts to get real </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when when when you start playing against </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> other people that's right well that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where i draw them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because because because you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh i i you know i could beat this person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or i could i could have won this event </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if i just had that extra broken gap </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the way i see it is that with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gacha you with the gacha games i play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're playing against a computer or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're playing through to get content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> um if you come if it becomes pvp then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of making someone else's day worse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by paying more you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely you're making someone else's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> gaming experience worse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you played more and that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's where i draw the line yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because i used to i don't know which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> game i played i think i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> found it on like mini clip or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this is like when i first started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> earning my own money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was like a game where it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like one of those like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like what's that clash of clans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the really popular mobile game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one where you build your own fort on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your square the map yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah but it takes like days for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their army to arrive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so this is like before even that was out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was playing a game similar to that on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like mini clip or some [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like i remember i was playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this game and i thought i was doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty well i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i only spent like 20 bucks and i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh this is i'm doing pretty good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for myself hey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then literally like a guy who had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just perfect like putin's palace worth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just came in and just one shot my entire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing that i'd spent months building </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah just because he clearly was like he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had like just oil money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something this man had everything in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the game which must have been like 50k </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> worth of stuff and just killed me and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was like i was like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the [ __ ] imagine peter winning a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> mini club game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like i felt bad that i spent 20 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bucks on it because i was like i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 18. and i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of money and i was like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> wiped out not only the hours that i put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in but the 20 bucks that i put in were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wiped out and i couldn't [ __ ] do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i had to sit there and watch his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> army coming for five days </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you can drop down the menu see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this man's army the man had sent like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the equivalent of like everything they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought in 300 against me and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> literally like it's like the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> persian </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i'm literally there with like my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] like stick men </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like ready and i'm seeing this army come </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like four weeks ahead and i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] okay like mom get the credit card </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what am i supposed to do this is so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> funny oh my god and a lesser man would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> have been like i can win this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unless a man would have thought i could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> out i could outbid this man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so this is why people hate micro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> transactions yeah i get it now i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> understand gamers that's i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> from that moment on as i slowly saw that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> man's army </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> approach me the resentment built every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> day to the point where i was like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is [ __ ] i'm just watching my work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> be destroyed </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> sloggers super mario sluggers gamecube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is so good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i had a [ __ ] ordeal trying to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sluggers on the wii oh really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really um so what happened with was is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that what i saw sluggers somewhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> online i was like mom i want this and it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was only available from like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> taobao or something on china right like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so my mom bought it from china </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right for me for christmas and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the one game that i really wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that christmas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i put it in and then obviously the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wii has um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that that has that what's uh region oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the region log yeah so i played it and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was like why isn't it working mom and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously my parents have no [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> idea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that like what is it we bought you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the game it's the game why isn't it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> working i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they didn't figure it out either and so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they sent it back and bought another one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from china again because for some some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> reason it didn't it wasn't out in europe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for some reason oh really i think if it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hadn't released yet because you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back then it was like for some reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they would leave six months between yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the police and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> europe and australia were always lost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> once together yeah yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd have to see all these youtube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> videos you're like i know this exists </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why can't i buy it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so i had no whole ordeal i never got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to play it in the end even though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> really two or three times i played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sliders at my friend's place and i had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the most fun i've ever played in a mario </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spin-off game i think yeah what is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sluggers there's the baseball </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> baseball one yeah i think that the mario </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> strikers is the best mario spinoff game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> well strikers there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> strikers they're sluggers and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there's uh mario three on three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> basketball as well oh my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yes do you know that one i never played </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dude legit i feel i feel like you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just naming mario party mini games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> dude honestly all of the sports </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spin-offs of mario are all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> such [ __ ] solid games like mario </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tennis [ __ ] solo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> mario golf [ __ ] solid i think i legit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would put like strikers like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> uh like up there with mario kart like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> main line yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i would i think it's that good like like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to me it's like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> okay of course i like sunshine gone yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of course i like all this game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like mario strikers that's when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're woke you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm listening like if your mates like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you want to play strikers you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] yet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because it was always like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are they you know because there was this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mechanic and it was probably the funnest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mechanic in a mario game where like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you so your team would be made of two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> main mario characters so you'd have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could put like waluigi and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd have like four coopers or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> four uh birdos or whatever right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then he could pick like wario </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so there's this mechanic where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could choose to do a super shot with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> main character if they had the ball </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was basically like a quick time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> event and you just nail it in like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> perfect like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the like the be like an arm that would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> swing and hit it in the perfect zone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you got it perfect it would be a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guaranteed goal so it's always a thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> holy [ __ ] can he do it and it was so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hard because the timing is super fast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's [ __ ] tiny and you have to i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think it's not even guaranteed unless </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're past the halfway point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right if we passed a halfway point to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it and yeah it's it's [ __ ] it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so [ __ ] good dude but do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> want to go through your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> three by three sure sure sure okay okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i gotta ask first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i know which one you're gonna ask why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what the [ __ ] is battalion wars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay all right i've never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i've never even heard of it if you look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up battalion wars it's like one of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> highest rated games on like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at least this one is on the wii and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first one is one of the highest rated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game dude it is like a really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good strategy game all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it's like um so i really like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's kind of like um it's kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really hard to experience like tanks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no so it was basically like you'd be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> given like a set amount of army so you'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be given maybe like three tanks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> four long range tanks ten uh ground </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> units and there would be a mission </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so the the way that it worked is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you would have to try and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> take over or take over a base or push </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> push the enemy out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without losing as many people as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> possible but the online was really good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was essentially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the same thing but one person was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> defending a point and the other person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had a push </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and it was really fun cause i got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really [ __ ] good at it when i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 15 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i would just keep winning and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would like cheese people with strats and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff it's such a good game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i played so [ __ ] much of that game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so good because i've never heard of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this game right and i look at this cover </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and i'm just like this looks like some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chinese knockoff game like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> dude this is like the mom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i want advanced wars we have advanced </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> wars at home can we zoom in can we zoom </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in on this yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can see you can see the cover here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right now oh dude it's good dude it's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good check out gameplay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> okay probably i'm just i'm not because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just like genuinely curious why i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> never heard of this game before yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of like um i don't know how to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> explore because it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it plays somewhat similar to halo wars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but but quite different like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's it as well so i completely forgot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the main mechanics of the game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so imagine a real-time strategy where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you can be like give me con </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first person control of this guy yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm gonna [ __ ] get on the ground and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do the work yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you can swap between the units of who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're doing first person right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so because sometimes obviously the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> automation is like good yeah you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously be way more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in control and do more damage so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know because there's tanks there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> planes there's whatever like the planes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were okay but if you went first person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] people up with them yeah and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could dodge [ __ ] way easier and stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dude it's so good anyone who played </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> battalion wars 2 will know it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no no i'm just realizing that we went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> through my entire three by three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talked talked about it for an hour and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not once did i use the term mechanic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's all gameplay mechanic i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh yeah it gave me the mechanic so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the selling point of games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right didn't didn't mention that once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> throughout my entire three by three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one thing that's going to be definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i guess throughout all of my nine is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like i really think they have like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> super like strong game mechanics no no i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> look at this and i'm just like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of these have really strong </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gameplay loops like guitar hero </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] of course yeah of course like i you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> music isn't my thing i like i like beeps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and boobs but guitar hero three i played </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] out of that trying to get like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i think everybody who had that game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> played the [ __ ] out legit i can't even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> remember the amount of times i attempted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through the fire and flames </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like just to like think that i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good and then watch someone on youtube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like a 10 year old crush me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> perfect dude because that was always the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game as well like no matter what person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if they were like i'm not into </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> yeah and so like that was that was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like such a great game and also i really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> value being a game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is so good at getting people who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't game into it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's so underrated i mean who doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game nowadays though well i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i could get my parents to play guitar </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> okay but the thing is did you own guitar </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> because like i only won guitar though i </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> because his thing like i love playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rhythm games i love playing especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when we're at the arcade and everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like that i love playing rhythm games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> loved the feeling playing rhythm games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've never like gotten to the point when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay i'm going to own a rhythm game now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm going to practice a rhythm game i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean when guitar hero was out man they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were [ __ ] everywhere it was so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> easy to get like knock-off guitar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ones and stuff like it was like before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rock band came along is when the hype </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> started dying but like it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone had rock yeah guitar hero yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm sad because like i feel the fact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> started learning how to actually play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guitar kind of threw me off playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> guitar hero </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like i would like watch people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> play guitar hero and i'd play it as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'd be like this is really fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i could also just be playing a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> guitar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> people who don't like instruments yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right right exactly and even now like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still enjoy watching like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> uh that twitch streamer who plays guitar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> custom songs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah like i love like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything about guitar just seems so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah yeah it's great i mean i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a banger what are you learning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where's the score system how do i get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ranked you know it's none of those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like people who play sports games hate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> playing sports </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well you know what other other rhythm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> game could have been on here that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i i didn't play the rhythm game but i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> played the other game of it was uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> donkey konger oh yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically donkey kong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the donkey kong bongos on gamecube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> jungle beat right jungle beat yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i thought was way better than the um uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the actual </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rhythm game one yeah game one which was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but then they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> had like a platformer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that was using the bongos yeah did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you see this yeah no jungle b was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] awesome you would like platform </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then like you would you'd like so if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you clapped at a certain thing and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you like hit both it would do a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> certain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh no i remember literally replacing the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> controller with like two points </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it played so well like you think it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wouldn't and then like sometimes the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the boss fights were like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clapping battles yeah it was so cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man the game was so good that could be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on here as well so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for me it was like only that one rich </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kid who had that game and everyone was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like wait you have it without end up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coming over well that was because like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> played uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the rhythm game one at my friend's house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i was like mom please get me this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for christmas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i like at the time i i kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really regretted it because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me it was like i paid like three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> times the price of a video game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right for just one game yeah and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> good but i was like oh it's over now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because for me it was a choice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> between jungle beat or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> taika and like i got taiko obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there's more places it was more for me i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think my problem with rhythm games is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that i have a hard time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looking at it as anything but a party </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and because like i i understand people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting getting into rhythm games but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cannot play a rhythm game for more than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a few songs before i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> okay i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i think one thing that rhythm games i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> quite like even though i don't like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> instruments or care about music much is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i really like the uh you can always like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like you're improving </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> even when you replay a song or like when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you're going through you always feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like you're improving i i'll tell you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what like rhythm games are it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's feeling like you're playing an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> instrument without going through the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> boring parts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like my god like imagine imagine if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could just learn how to play guitar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> without having to do scales </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right like wait there's only five </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> buttons yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's so easy you mean i don't i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to like practice scales five times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like five times every time just one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rhythm game i didn't put in my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> three by three but i could easily put it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on there is um rhythm heaven </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know that game on the ds i played </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the [ __ ] it i played that game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so much that i snapped two ds styluses </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> while playing that game holy [ __ ] snap i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't know this thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because i was like so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> concentrated on it that like i literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a [ __ ] crap yes just impaled </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like the stick comes out the other side </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> legit i played like the reason why my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> original ds broke was because i played </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> too much rhythm here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh my god because it got to the point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like my touch pad was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've damaged me like so much so that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the inside is just [ __ ] now and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing responded </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's like your ds is just like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime character who's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who's like gone through hell and just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> has been like battered and bruised no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dude my my ds [ __ ] like the touch pad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on my ds just looked like bucky's body </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just like shattered it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this guy's been through like a thousand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> years old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so much guns in it yeah oh dude it was </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> playing rhythm evan any other questions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> um i mean everything's sonic rider yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> listen i know this is gonna get flat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right i'm surprised this wasn't the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immediate thing that i was giving flag </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right i'm just shocked there's a sonic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game honestly like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't give you flack because i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> actually really close to putting sonic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> adventure 2 on my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> no sonic battle adventure 2 yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was that was that was that easily </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> could have been on here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> running around at the speed of sound </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just for like me like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me like giving like my chows like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> steroids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] in there drag him up do the race </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i love that that was so fun um yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean like sonic riders was like the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that because it came with my gamecube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right so when i bought the gamecube it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was when it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> already dying and they were just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally trying to sell it with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything so i got like um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a bunch of free games with my gamecube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for like very cheap </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and sonic riders was the one that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hated most that came with this game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like these controls suck dick it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is one of the most janks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like so [ __ ] jank right and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the the learning curve for this game the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mechanics seemed completely like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> overkill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a kids game yeah but then after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like i actually sat down and like just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like 20 hours didn't understand the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> game and like eventually understood what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was happening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this game felt so [ __ ] clean like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> felt so good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i felt that way with uh kirby's air ride </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for the first like 10 hours i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wait it's not just a racing game yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what the [ __ ] is this i have to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> earn my ride and then go into what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right right because there was like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like glide mechanic where you had to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like jump in the other person's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trail yeah it was completely jank and it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would like throw you out and stuff and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so gent but it was like probably the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my impressions on it completely 180'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after i like actually put time into it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right i got good at it and i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is a [ __ ] clean game and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> played it so goddamn much i played this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i was glad to know that i'm not the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> only one who has like a 3d sonic game as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a guilty pleasure game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dude yeah it was like for me it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sonic heroes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i i could have personally yeah and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't put in my 3x3 just because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if i did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i know people will be like you put a 3d </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sonic game no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> dude i could i could put some honestly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like i i defend it i i have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no like fond memories of any 2d sonic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> games but it's the 3d sonic games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i have fun i remember i tried it look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's one reason because i was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nintendo kid through and through so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sonic wasn't available till the gamecube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay that's why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly that's why listen sonic right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this is a good game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you if you learn listen like if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> watch people play it for the first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll be like this is [ __ ] garbage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah this is the worst game ever but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then if you see someone who's good at it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like damn that looks [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no legit it's a good game no it is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good game i played it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why i'm glad to know that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not the only one who's like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what there are good sonic games like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> special </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sonic heroes if i replayed it probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> jank as [ __ ] oh yeah i probably hate the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] out of it i'm like i remember that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> casino level i [ __ ] hated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in that game but i enjoyed sonic i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember you just keep dying randomly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> from stuff in there yeah it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was one of the most i don't think it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was a [ __ ] game yeah i don't think i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> played sonic heroes but i've definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> played </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some 3d sonic games and i've actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> enjoyed most of them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's [ __ ] i mean i mean i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> black ops is self-explanatory </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> black ops 2 that is i think even though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i played i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't tell you the difference well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a big there's a massive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> difference okay okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay there's you know as if any you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which one's the one where it literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> starts off with the airport getting shot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's moderate that's my extent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of knowledge of course when that came </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> out that was such a big deal like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it was a huge idea </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my mom like she'd already bought me the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game and then she was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> connor i've heard about this thing in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this game where you kill a bunch of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people at an airport </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't buy you that game did i and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like no no no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she was like oh okay good good good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no russian no yeah modern warfare 2 is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one that i probably played the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> modern warfare 3 is one where i won a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bunch of free [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then black ops 2 was probably the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> one i had most fun with and that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> played competitively like in teams and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff and i really enjoyed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it was so fun it was so clean yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that game they like optimized it it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the best card 100 hands down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the maps were the best the multiplayer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had like a good rank system which they'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never had before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't think they ever put back in like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was legit good it was such a it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just a [ __ ] great game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fantastic [ __ ] game anyone who likes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> card will tell you that black ops 2 is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the best game yeah that's that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what i hear most of the time it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's either black ops 2 or modern </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> warfare you're like this is all noise to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is is this how it feels when we talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about music </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably i'm i'm like i'm like cool oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's has it got the people the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> balanced you know it's it's just a great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just the game and i i put way too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> many hours and it's what got me into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like competitive gaming and i like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really that was like the first esports i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> started watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i just had like a really good tournament </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay um but then all the [ __ ] pro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> players like weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as [ __ ] at that time they were just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it was weird it was very strange </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i'm not surprised you have time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> crisis and metal slug in there because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah whenever we go to an arcade </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> together and that you have metal gear or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so metal slugs all right see you later </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> metal slug i have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always just been obsessed with other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> places uh that's battles like acts i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i think metals like x is like the best </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game overall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um if you don't know what metal slug is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a neo geo game that was really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> popular in arcades and you can probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still find it in a lot of arcades </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um it's aged super [ __ ] well oh it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looks so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the sprite work on it for its time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like insane yeah like and it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looks like it's still almost insane and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's got like some of the best [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sound effects the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rocket launcher i love that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the gameplay is so goddamn clean in that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game yeah it doesn't overstay its </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> welcome it's like his six levels enjoy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them get the [ __ ] out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did you ever enjoy contra contra was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really [ __ ] difficult like i mean it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah i think the the reason why i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't like i think metal slug three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like probably one of the way too hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is that like it goes from like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> level one and two and metal slug three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from being you know a fairly challenging </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh to like level uh i think four five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and six just being absolutely [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> stupid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean i remember the first time you and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i ever like game together we played all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three of the middle slogging games back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if with two people who played the game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you could easily breeze through it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then we got the three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and we were like [ __ ] this game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so hard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three like there is it is like you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to play that game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every absurd amount because even if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know where all the enemies are spawning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and where they're coming from it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it doesn't matter because there's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so much [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's literally yeah yeah it's complete </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] i just did it just to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] with you and take your money i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> realized there should have been another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game on my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> three by three i'm like we're talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about this uh mega man x </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god yeah like i'm thinking i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking like side scrollers i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> completely forgot how much i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> obsessed with sci-fi i was i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tossing up between mega man x and mega </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> man 2 right yeah just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> purely mega man x is just [ __ ] it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it still feels like anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right it's got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's got such an anime story line yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my god like the the gameplay in that is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> clean as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i forgot how much i loved hard games as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a kid yeah man i really [ __ ] now i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hey yeah please because i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> man yeah i remember i completed contra </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> super contra at least on the snes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without without the contra code uh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without the controversy my cousin i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hardcore gamer right yeah i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember completing mega man and that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was really easy what the [ __ ] happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to me man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because i was exactly the same like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i i haven't beaten contra without the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> conjurer code yeah but like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember like how easy it was for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like mega man 2. i could be in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hour and like you know a lot i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> last year the year before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like i want to stream some retro </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> games oh i'll play mega man 2. because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> played that like [ __ ] crazy yeah dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i got like 30 minutes in i only beat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like two like [ __ ] robo boss i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this game is [ __ ] impossible how did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i beat this as like a 10 year old you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> should have patience man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but no because yeah okay go for it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but like stuff with like contra like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never played as a kid so when i play now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like just [ __ ] kills you because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a lot of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right like yeah i'm just immediately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> turned off from [ __ ] like that yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no this is just [ __ ] it's it's weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this conversation has brought back so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> many memories about how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how much patience i had as a kid yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i remember another game that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh people complained about being super </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hard and super [ __ ] he was battle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> toads </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um it was the level with the bikes right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah i i still remember the level </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the bikes and having to complete </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that and completing battle toes and i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man i remember i i think i just blanked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it out because there was just so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hours of my life that were just some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] level yeah and i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as a kid you were just mind-numbingly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just like [ __ ] learnt it through um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> through muscle memory right right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i would not have the patience to do that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> anymore like if it was like you value </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> your time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like if there's something like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because battle told by the battle toads </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's be honest is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah full of [ __ ] but i [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> love that game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but because you can't you can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> play that now and be like this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fantastic it's like ninja gaiden for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as well yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that game is just free yeah where it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like i remember i almost beat that game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as a kid and i got to like i think like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the second to last level now i can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> even get past level one yeah and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i'm trying to think about how the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] did i be mega man x </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the [ __ ] snez controller right my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> god i remember getting like cramps and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> carpool tunnel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from like the like like tapping the jump </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> button on the wall </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like again some of the bosses right at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> least it's not as bad as a nest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> controller </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that thing was [ __ ] awful in your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> hands </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah i i just think for me metal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> slug </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the best age just a best overall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> uh running guns i think i think it's one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the one of the games that's like age </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the best i feel like if you look at any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like any indie game that comes out now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that is like a side scroller running gun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it just it looks so inspired by metals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah my work is like identical yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's like the blueprint of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is how you make a clean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> running gun yeah it's you know metal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> slug you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three is [ __ ] um but like one two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and x </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean x is just kind of two yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one two and x like i would highly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recommend getting x i think it's on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> steam one and two are also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on steam you can get all of them yeah go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and get it it's such a fun game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um it's just great this is when you play </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with someone else right yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so funny yeah it's so difficult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as well so it's just a great game i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's clean yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm on crisis man okay some [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the original one i think is such a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> goddamn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gem of a game when you go to an arcade </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you see i still think time crisis is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good and the only reason i could never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> progress </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> too far in time crisis was because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> never had enough money yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so like i think once you get over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that point of time crisis where you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> beaten it a few times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can beat the whole game at least </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> game one on one credit like pretty much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty easily yeah because you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know when all the bullshit's coming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and to me when i used to play because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know when you're when you would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to an arcade right because we i would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stay in like france for like i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> know two weeks at a time yeah my parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> would give me like two euros a day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe how did you complete the game the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first time which is what i wanted yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i've i've like no matter what i i have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always run out of money yeah i feel i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like the first time you played time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> crisis if you only had like two credits </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah you could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe get possible you know maybe up to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like stage two so this was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something over like years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where it was like i would always even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like see it in arcades and i would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always pick it up and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe if i had two weeks i would play it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like every day for two weeks right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or i would like you know and as well i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got to the point where it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when when okay if you had your name on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the high score </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all of them so i would go and try and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> take all 10 slots when i would go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when i would go to like a vacation point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again because i would be there for like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two weeks so i'm like oh what i'm gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do is i'm gonna take every single </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> slot on this thing yeah but then i um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so eventually what you could what i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> would do is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i would be like if someone was gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> play it i would just like i would just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chill out and i'd be like oh that's me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by the way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they would be like oh yeah they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> would be like oh you want to play with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like hell yeah give me your credit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they'd give me a credit right and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> could just play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you literally game the system no yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then but then it was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because some people uh some of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> systems when they pulled out the plug at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> night like it would wipe all the high </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> schools that was like my worst nightmare </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i would i would get the high </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> score </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you know feel real good i'd come </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back the next day and i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where is it where is my high school my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> street cred </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> gone just like that i'm like no how did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you prove that that name was you though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what i want to know people just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> took your word for it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> um that's a good question how did they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do i guess it's just the old system </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right of just people just took your word </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i guess the moment they i put the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> coin and i started [ __ ] just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> destroying everyone they'd be like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> think it's him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's you know this the old speed run </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> rules right like you don't need you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't we don't need video proof we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trust that you say well because like if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're a rookie right time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they'd go like this you know i would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just like so i would like get yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then like flick it off like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> excuse you in time crisis right that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so yeah because the way right i learned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right i'm like wait the the normal way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of shooting so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you i'm assuming most people who are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching this have seen or played a time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> crisis if you haven't it's the one where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you put your pedal down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the thing and then you pop out to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shoot that should be enough to let you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know i mean i assume if you've left your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> house been to an arcade or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything or then bowling you've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this thing it's it's [ __ ] basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the best arcane </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh arcade game you can play you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> live in japan yeah and i realized right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after a while i'm like right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're doing the whole like holding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it with two hands pointing shooting your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> finger isn't fast enough and the way the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time crisis worked with points is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you had to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like there would be this like a smash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> combo right when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shot a character first there was like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> split second where you could keep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shooting them with bullets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get more points and combo it so if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you shot someone once that's it you only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got like 10 points </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could unload like eight bullets into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one person so what you'd have to do is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they would all pop up on screen you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to get like max amount of points on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> each person on screen right so i would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unload the whole mag into one character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so that's how you had to be like a man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like discovered turbo mode no yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was literally like imagine like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> literally just learned the technique of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like spamming this thing like this i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would like to twitch my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely like oh [ __ ] like and then i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> would do it for everyone on the screen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so that way no one came close to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beating me in school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah and then i would remember the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> points where like i think a time crisis </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or two there's a point where you get a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> machine gun and if you you could like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> juggle the cover </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so that you could keep your combo even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> while going in cover mm-hmm so you could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like juggle it to get an absurd combo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this man at age 10 is optimizing games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so i remember this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> speech like literally like age 13 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then like it was like yeah in maxing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> time crisis yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i loved it and then you know then you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> start playing time crisis three and four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so two was nice two is when they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> introduced like sorry i'm gonna go into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in depth yeah no no no no no no no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so time crash is one all you had was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pistol yeah and you could do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> boom time guys two they started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> introducing like weird [ __ ] like machine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gun grenade </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shotgun you're like all right whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cool time guys is threes where they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> start getting [ __ ] weird with it and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they start introducing all this dumb </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] and now we're on like seven </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and it's just garbage like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] game where you just get [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shot it's like it's like house of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> dead well you were playing five the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other day and you said five was all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's okay but like they introduced like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they i feel like they they did what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> house of the dead did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like where house of the dead was an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing arcade game one was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty challenging two was quite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> difficult and they started adding a few </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> things that were like that's true that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cheeky that and three onwards they just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> started adding [ __ ] that would just kill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you yeah like unless you literally like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> perfect headshot yeah everything yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you've played it right yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's times where you're literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hitting everything on house of the dead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just like it doesn't matter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah just [ __ ] dead and it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this game [ __ ] sucks dick [ __ ] this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> game you just took my money and i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like it i'm a good guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally you're literally that kid you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know in persona 5. you know the kid in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the arcade yeah like teaches you the gun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> moves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's literally i'm i'm just sitting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here i'm i'm just thinking i don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've heard connor talk more passionately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like since i've been friends with this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time crisis </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> crisis is the best game and i also had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it on ps2 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that also helped okay wow that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the next stage up right so i had i had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time gracious two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the ps2 and so when i went to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> arcade i was like it's just like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> simulations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i've been waiting to use that meme </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was literally like that because i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i already know exactly when is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> optimization </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i i know all the levels off by [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> matrix </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> well that was the thing as well it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like because because you were like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> were broke and you didn't have credits </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you i would legit like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was the same thing with metal slug i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would be like i would just go up to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kids and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hey i'm really [ __ ] good at this if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you give me a credit i'll help you get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> really far and then you'll be like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> okay sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because then it was a win-win because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though i was doing all the work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they felt like they were getting an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> extra 15 minutes of fun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they would have got two yeah you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> know what i mean i mean that's that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the thing right where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know that i mean i guess arcade </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> games were the original pay to win </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like like i never met a single person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> who had completed time crisis because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> does any kid my age complete time yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> would like i would like have a fit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my head if i even got hit once in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time crisis after a while because i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i knew where they all should have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> been coming this man is trying to know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hit time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> well it was like it was so fun because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> after like you said right you're not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> supposed to that the games weren't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> designed for you to play it this much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but this is also why they started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> upping the difficulty of arcades because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people would just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sit there all day yeah and complete </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> games on one dollar and get 30 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they should have been getting two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so that's why they started upping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know now it's like all the arcade </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> games like even the ones that used to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like pretty fair and used to feel good i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just [ __ ] like yeah like the mario </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kart arcade game now [ __ ] that game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sucks you get one race </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's shitty you know like if you were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing like daytona back in the day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if you were [ __ ] good at that game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you kept to get you kept playing because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you kept getting to the checks points </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right but now it's like you get one race </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] off that was three dollars it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no just because you got to take a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> picture with me and put it on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> character you think that's enough to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> keep me happy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> oh [ __ ] off mario this is [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> although to be fair every time i see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that and i'm with like three other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> people i'm like they always want to play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you play it and then every time you play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it you're like all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because people want to play because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's mario kart </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it plays worse than the actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mario kart yeah how do they do that it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> supposed to be better what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm so passionate about because arcade </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> games suck now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> see dog va the fall of arcade games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's some good verizon for them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know i think we spoke about it on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the podcast four but typing of the dead </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in uh i think i hope it isn't in the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that closed down because one of the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> centers in akihabara closed down right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and only one of them had typing of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the dead yeah because you don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what typing of that is google it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh yeah that's good um the jojo battle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> royale is okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's like a it's like an unreal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> engine mod there's it's kind of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah there's no real arcade games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now actually it's always the mech one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we even spoke about that have we oh no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the giant mech one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was [ __ ] amazing we don't know what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's called but here it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so we know what it looks like you get to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> pilot a mac like you literally sit in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the cockpit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you put a seat belt on and there's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh gas pedals </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> drift pedals yeah and it's like 4d </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cinema so it actually yeah it moves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it moves as you are flying about so you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as close to a mecca pilot as you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> possibly be and it's got ranked pvp </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so you literally you literally like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all jump in the mechs with the boys and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can pvp against other people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally capture the flag yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like domination i think yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and yeah you literally like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so fun because when you smack down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that thrust and drift pedal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] the chair jumps back yeah it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> jumps back and then it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah like uh was it like when the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chains going up on the roller coaster </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like drifting yeah yeah it's so good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like drifting in the end just firing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> missiles at the same time i'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dealing with that with the boys you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> switch out the game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and reload the other one as you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> saying oh my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah we're trying to arcade after </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some players yeah yeah you come to japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you've got to check this this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like everyone says rhythm games no this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the best arcade game i've played </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in japan bar none yeah i believe it's is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> sega yeah it's saying yeah it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've already seen it in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a few are like rounds and i saw it in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sega but like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's actually insane i think it's is it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two dollars or three dollars a play it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> two dollars not enough yeah two dollars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a player i think but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> one play can last you you know like 15 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes 15 20 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'd happily play like pay like five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pounds if it was like in the uk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because my god you get to pilot a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mecca that's so cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh god i don't even know what's going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because i can't read what the [ __ ] the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] they're saying yeah like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i love it it's so funny i mean i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> can read what they're saying but i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not important to me all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before we move on okay like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i like i i'm wondering why okay before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we get to halo wars i'm wondering why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you put apex over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> over league all right okay is this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this recency bias </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i think there's definitely a bit of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recency bias yeah um i don't know for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> league of legends was fun and i really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> really really enjoyed the time i had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it could easily be on here yeah i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> apex is on here just because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know apex made learning japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fun for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay like isn't that isn't that fun yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you're actually using it right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for me apex has been such a door opener </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like right now like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like everyone's playing apex </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now and like it's so easy to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yo player packs let's jump in </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> even though i just started playing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> recently i have been playing it i did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> start playing it at launch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and i feel like the game's only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gotten bigger and better now and i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like that's rare </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for games especially battle royale like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel like it's more popular now than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and it's [ __ ] massive in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> japan </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> just completely broke the system yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's crazy i mean you know it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's crazy seeing how like when it came </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> out you know the story of apex is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they they literally announced apex </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> legends i don't know if you knew this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a day before it came out oh [ __ ] really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because what happened was is that it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> made by the same people as titanfall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right so ea thought it says published by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yay but it's made by respawn the people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who made titanfall who made call of duty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> modern warfare 2 back in the day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you have that you have that clean fps </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gameplay combined with a nutty movement </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of titanfall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah um and yes so what happened was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they literally were just like oh by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the way is a new battery owl </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and because they thought it was gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bomb because it was made by the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had made titanfall yeah with no titans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in it yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and everyone was like yeah i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> playing that where the [ __ ] max the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mechs were the best part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but yeah no it was a surprise hit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it [ __ ] blew up the gameplay is so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] clean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like i mean i've like from what i heard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> apex was just battle royales but just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with every mechanic refined it's so good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so fun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know it's really like weirdly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the most beginner-friendly battle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> royales i think yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i want to know is has it gotten to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a point where everyone's just really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] good at the game yet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> no there's a meta and everything's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> broken the matchmaking is surprisingly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good like when i play ranked i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really struggle like against people my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> own level when i go in like normals if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like playing with uh someone who's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like got a really bad stats it'll like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even us out like i can feel like a god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know so in other words yes but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's on the other side </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> no no no no no because i'm playing you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know i play with some people who are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know arguably have no hands yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they seem to have the time of their life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and i'm you know to me i would be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that's not fun but they seem to you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again people who you know because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> such a position heavy game it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about mechanics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's more about do like okay are you if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are you standing out in the open and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone else is on the high ground </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> shooting at you you're probably gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] die yeah but like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't need to have like aim god cs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go [ __ ] that's like i hate that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fortnite felt like that as well like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you just have like some form of game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> knowledge which you can easily learn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know it's easy and all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> characters are really unique it's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fun like i don't know it's great i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really think you guys should try it out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> try it out with me apex stream literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every episode every episode i'm gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> keep saying it until </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> trash taste apex when it's good like and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> legit like i've made so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> new friends from it and yeah like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other week 47 of asking the boys to play </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> literally like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so the other day i actually met up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with people who i met up on apex i met </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on apex </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with two japanese guys oh really spent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the whole night trying to talk japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was very like taxing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my god i realized i was an hour into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> talking only japanese and i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] i had to do this for like another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> four hours of like not being able to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> communicate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah um it will do wonders though oh no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it was definitely helping like i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like i definitely have like the basics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> completely locked down like it's all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> muscle memory like i could just say [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just talk nonsense you know that's good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff oh chinchin big you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the stuff you need um it's the only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing that's that matters yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it was fun you know it was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> crazy to think that i met these guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from just chatting [ __ ] on a video game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> literally just going in a lobby and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> screaming broken japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then i was hanging out with them you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> know that's cool yeah it was just chill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like i think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> all about the friends we made along the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way and honestly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which you can't say about league of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> legends exactly i have made friends from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> league of legends but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just felt like i can't imagine making </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a friend from a guy you met in a lobby </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in league of legends so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well that's the thing it was always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weird friendships with them like with a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with it because it was always like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were the same rank we played ranked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> together </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah this weird thing of like that that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was what it was and we were like we our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> friendship was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tangential on the fact that we were both </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the same rank and we were good enough to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> play together </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah but in apex it's like oh you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know i you know i play with a guy who's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> called kyochan he's like a 45 year old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man right from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like west uh japan who's [ __ ] awful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> at the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but he's he's really funny and so like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like you know i like playing with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> him that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just like there's no it feels chill it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a really chill game but it can be a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really intense game if you want it to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and it's like perfect because it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has like enough lows in it where you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then when the moments where you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like fighting it's like it's focus on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fighting all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so that's why it's on there i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> legitimately think it's the best battery </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've played i've played so many of them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it deserves to be on there it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] great game play pex legends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and finally halo wars i'll quickly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talk about this i played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i have probably put more hours into any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game here uh halo was probably the game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i put most hours into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really why halo wars i don't know what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was it was me what made me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fall in love with rts's that game was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> terribly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unrefined and and awfully unbalanced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know i've never played wars but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's all i've heard about yeah that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> extremely unbalanced i think it was the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> case of i was very fortunate that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my my four like i had three best friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and we all loved halo wars so as a case </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of every single day we just went home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> played halo wars yeah and it was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the perfect game to chat to and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> also be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know all right do this do this yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i really like the idea of rts games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i like i mean i i remember playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> command and conquer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so [ __ ] much that was that was my rts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game but i i like i've never got into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like more than just build a bunch of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> soldiers and then click on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> click on anyone who looks at you funny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is that that's like my tactics when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it comes to rts games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think the one thing that i really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> loved about halo wars is that it really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did 2v2 and 3v3 well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i can't think of a single rts game that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has 3v3 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like can you name it it's always 1v1 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and like i find that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like boring yeah like the fact that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can be there with my mates and we can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> all back each other up and then like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you kill one dude's army </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] his his friend's army is literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> coming to wipe you out and then you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like bro bring in your army where you at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man where you at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what the [ __ ] that actually sounds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> really fun because that's so funny i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> guess that's the reason i never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> played pvp in any rts even though i know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there is there i just played the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> campaign and i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i can complete the campaign and it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chill game because it's like the games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were never more than 20 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 20 30 minutes they were normally 15 10 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> minutes so it was great because what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would happen is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know there would just be moments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where your mate or there would be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all three of them would be attacking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your mate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and none of you are ready and you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah i'll see ya </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did i play [ __ ] no like i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realizing my my three by three is a lie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why is red alert two not on my three by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three red look come on and conquer red </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lord too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a [ __ ] amazing game and not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> many people remember it yeah halo wars 2 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is pretty good it's on uh you play on pc </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's pretty good does are the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> civilization games rts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like turn based it's like almost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> turn-based right because i really really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like this i played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two like [ __ ] crazy back in the day i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like it's in the category it's in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the category it's like a different style </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like i play civilization every now and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> again because you know when you get that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feeling of just replaying a game every </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much like gaunt right i i think my three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by three is a little bit of a lie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's a bunch of games on here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because to me i was like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for me through and through i was always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a nintendo simp </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah nintendo seemed from the moment i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got my first game console to today </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but because of that i feel i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> too many nintendo games on my 3x3 i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's it's the first thing that came </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to your mind right yeah but i would okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's one game that i would [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put on here on the xbox </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh that's uh this game called ssx </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> tricky </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of course oh my god i forgot about that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i put so many hours into that game that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was such a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that was such a good [ __ ] game oh my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> god dude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ssx tree okay for those who don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> ssx is the snowboarding game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and it did you play snowboard kids </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as well on the n64 was that just me oh i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> played a little bit of that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i played a little bit of that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think i think it was the first time i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> saw ssx3 because i think my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dad got it yeah because like my dad was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the one who bought the xbox because he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wanted to play like a bunch of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> racing car games and one of the racing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> card games that me and my dad [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bonded over was burn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> out three that's the [ __ ] yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] amazing which i would also put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on my three by three but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he also brought home this game called </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ssx tricky i'm like i never [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cared about snowboarding i didn't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what the [ __ ] this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> joey we haven't seen snow we live in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> australia yeah that's going to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something legit the first time i ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> saw snow it was an sssg </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but like i played it and the moment you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hear that [ __ ] title screen music i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hell the [ __ ] yeah like to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just getting reminded but ssx tricky </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is on like the same level as tony hawk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah in my mind in terms of just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> addictive gameplay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> tony hawk's pro skater 2. yeah i never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> played any of these games oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry like ssx trick i don't know i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> think the one thing i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] optimized the [ __ ] out of ssx </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah because it was probably the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one game where i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no no no this isn't the perfect score i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know i can fit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> one more trick into this show when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're addicted to a game it's like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i know i could fit like one more 180 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into this like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trick combo of this one yeah and i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just keep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] playing this over and over and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over and over again i think i 100 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> percent of it actually it was probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the first games a hundred percent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i was close to 100 percent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as well i mean all of these games have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 100 percent yeah yeah um in terms of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> uh pokemon silver the original silver </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the one game where i've actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> broken the in-game timer like i played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so much of silver right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like how do you do that what is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in-game timer the in-game time the max </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in-game time is 999 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hours and that's reasonable which is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reasonable it's like a thousand hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right but the only way i achieve that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know obviously you play through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the game and then you're like okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well i've finished i've gotten all 16 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> badges what do i do now yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> complete the decks okay i'll do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's the step after that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get every pokemon to level 100. okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've done that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right get all the shinies and i did that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with you what the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] i did that would you take that to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yourself i did that to myself because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the time right i was borrowing my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> friend's game boy color </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right like we kind of like this was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> during the time where like i had like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> couple of childhood friends like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lived nearby where we met each other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> often enough where it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> can i borrow your n64 can i borrow your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> super nintendo or whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so i never actually owned the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boy color </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and but i had pokemon silver </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um i don't remember where i got it from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe i borrowed it from my friend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably like that probably something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that but like i borrowed the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> boy color enough times where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like and it was the only gameboy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and also silver was the only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gameboy color game i had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right as well so it's like whenever i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saw the gameboy color just sitting on my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> desk i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well i mean i could just [ __ ] play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this yeah and kill some time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and as a kid you know you have no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> concept of time as you're playing a game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right so it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so yeah i just [ __ ] was like well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally got nothing else to do other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> than i guess i'll just try and catch all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the shinies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my god and i [ __ ] did that and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that sounds like torture and i maxed out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the in-game clock i was like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 999 is the max all right i got it now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> jesus yeah nice joey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm telling you like you think you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know god thinks he's like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> once you're into a game you get addicted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to it yeah i get [ __ ] no no no no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no i i know you do you're on another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> level and like kirby's uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> nightmare in dreamland was the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever game i owned because the gameboy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> advance was the first console i own i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think i've played that game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've never played a single kirby game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> okay this game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was the game that got me to kirby right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> since then i [ __ ] love every kirby </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> game and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm telling you like if you're ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feeling sad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just play a kirby yeah it might be the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> most like your child </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so i'm gonna describe you a copy of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> cubby's dream literally if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like you might think it's like childish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and dumb and like [ __ ] easy or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but it is literally impossible to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> play a kirby game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and not be happy like it's it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's this challenge except there is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there is there's something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's something about it where it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like i might be in the shittiest [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'll play like 30 minutes of any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kirby game yeah immediately happy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and like i think that's why i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> liked playing it because i was like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't want to play a game that makes me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sad i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> later on in my adulthood i was like yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> jerry's like heavy rain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> heavy rain yes metal gear solid give me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> all of that sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yes uh i i would like a bit of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> depression please and uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and i think again like that's another </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> reason why i like played a lot of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> animal crossing for example or like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know again like pokemon it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't you put animal crossing in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the top nine in your life yeah damn yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> okay because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> every like this one in particular well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well yeah honestly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> well wild world specifically because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was [ __ ] obsessed with the ds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this was one of the few this is the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> ds one i was gonna say cause i heard a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know now that now that people have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like calmed down about an animal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> crossing the first one i've heard a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of people being like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it is good but it does feel like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> lacking in a lot of ways yeah and that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they're adding in the functions that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> were in the previous ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah literally all the add-ons that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they currently added </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what is the point of animal crossing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean i i i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm trying to understand why there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like anti-vaxxers when i'm watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i like i hear i hear what you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saying i get it but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm seeing it and i'm like i don't get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it at all i i totally get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people which is why i was really shocked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how popular the newest one got yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> animal crossing a lot like harvest moon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i always thought was like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one niche series where it's like if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weren't into it from the beginning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't matter how many new games they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> bring out you'll never get into it i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean like the more people talk about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the more i'm just like well this is just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a pay your mortgage simulator yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i i watch it and i'm like okay so you go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> hit that rock and then you you get some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stone okay and then you go and talk to a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guy who gives you a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> recipe for something that you didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want and then you go and make that thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's like a cabinet that you might </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then i'm like confusing if you don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want it you can sell that and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything is just seems </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so slow and of course it's nintendo so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] is just unnecessarily complicated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i saw someone going to like uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone else's island </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it took like a minute of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cutscenes to go to someone's island or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something yeah and then like everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just seemed slow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in it and i was like why i think that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the entire point of animal crossing it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> supposed to be slow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's not supposed to be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh [ __ ] uh harvest moon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i get the sims though right because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're kind of like you're kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you you're kind of like living a life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that maybe that maybe you couldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in real life you know what's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> weird i never got into the sims </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i know i never got into the sims i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> always thought sims was really boring </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah which is weird because of an animal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> crossing because the thing is i really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like simulation games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but i've never like never a life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> simulator game i've always liked what it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know why i never go into the sims </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because it wasn't cute </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly i understand that honestly you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> look at harvest moon you look at animal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> crossing you're like that's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> adorable i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was i was never into sims but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when i started voice acting and it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> weird tangent yeah like i started seeing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sims voice acting project everywhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right people making their own movies in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sims </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this was a huge thing oh yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> machinima yeah and i was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what the [ __ ] this is ugly and it looks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dumb yeah and it's like the animations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of sims like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and then they would you have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like voice act to it and i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like that's part of the like old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> age of the internet there's something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's some campiness to it that i feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like has its own charm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah right absolutely it would be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like this oscar-worthy drama </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> performed via sims animation it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i think that's the whole appeal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right because when uh animal crossing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first came out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right i think i read this somewhere and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> correct me if i'm wrong internet but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think the whole appeal of animal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> crossing was it was supposed to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> marketed towards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> housewives in japan right who wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as you know their husbands or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> significant others were out working all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> day yeah that's literally how they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> marketed it because i was like it was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> non-challenging game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no literally it was like it was a game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where i was like are you tired of being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in the kitchen all day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah literally it's like because it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so not challenging </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and also it's non-stressful either it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's a game that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> literally just gets all your stress off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because you forget about everything in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in your real world yeah where you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just focus on a completely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> separate just there are no you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stresses or no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i guess like bad things to happen with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like any consequence whatsoever in this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right so it's literally nintendo was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like imma create a distraction for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stressed adults </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and call it animal crossing because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember my first and only experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with animal crossing was the original </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> animal crossing on the gamecube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right and the only reason i knew about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was because i don't i think for the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> longest time it just wasn't available in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the uk like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was only available like they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> translated it but it was only available </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and i had heard about it from like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this nintendo gaming pc i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gaming magazine yeah gaming magazine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gaming magazine that's what i meant to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> say this nintendo gaming magazine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they were like it just got like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> super good reviews and i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> holy [ __ ] this must be a banger of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> game every [ __ ] review is given </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every review is giving this five out of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five yeah i'm just like holy [ __ ] this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this this is a must-get game why is this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not available in the uk right so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally had to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> look up some like import websites and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like seriously like i had to import </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> animal crossing from the us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> buy like a specialized import disk where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um yeah because um old gamecube games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were region logged so you couldn't just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> put a us disk into a uk device </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you needed a special disk that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> needed to insert into the gamecube um to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> regen unlock it so that you can put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> animal crossing into yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so i had to research and do that to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that by myself with a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very limited budget because i i didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really have much of a budget to work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with back then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but i i had saved up and i brought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> animal crossing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i was just like this is gonna be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amazing guys this is gonna be an amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've imported this game which is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expensive to import a game and i bought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> extra hardware on top of that just so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could play the game because every review </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> said it was amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and then i started playing it i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just like when's the gameplay kicking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like okay it's an awfully long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> cutscene yeah yeah i was like okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> okay i was picking apples i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the gameplay is going to kick in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometime i'm going to have a point to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why i'm doing this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i i expected it to be on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same level as like pokemon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or stuff like that when i'm catching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff or i'm like i'm going on an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> adventure yeah and i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay surely when i pay off this mortgage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's when the gameplay all kicking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i play i play animal crossing and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i and i [ __ ] paid tom nook back or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever the [ __ ] is i pay off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i pay off my mortgage because i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like there must be a reason why every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> every magazine is giving this five stars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pay off my mortgage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then the game just continues and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then tom looks like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here's another mortgage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what's interesting is like okay because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you like games like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> banjo-kazooie or like jrpgs where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like a whole like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> collect like a collecting element to it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah like linear games more than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> open world and stuff like that i i do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like linear games more than openly right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i like it's funny because i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i do like the idea of open world games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but if i'm going to sit down and play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something then i much prefer linear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> games right because one of my favorite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> aspects of animal crossing personally is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the whole like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> catching fish and bugs and collecting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the artworks and collecting all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> furniture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's basically the collecting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> portion of it right whereas a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other people who play the game you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enjoy the whole like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> diy you know creating your own amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looking town amazing looking house kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of thing to me that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> second yeah number one for me is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely like i need to complete my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fish index i need to complete my bug </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> index </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why why why do you want to do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because i got that love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from playing all the jrpgs right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously six is up there because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was that for six </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for me as well but like i think the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reason why i picked six and i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why final fantasy 6 is my favorite not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only final fantasy game but my favorite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jrpg ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah is because like it was the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game where i was like this is a work of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> art </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right like this is like not just a game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like the gameplay is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cool you know i've played all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> previous final fantasies like four and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one and [ __ ] like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right the gameplay is basically the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but six was the first time where i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't know story could be this good i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't know game music could be this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't know you could have this much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> immersion in a game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah where and i got to like the fight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the fact that you know people still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to this day about like the final fight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> scene right yeah i like the six </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like final fantasy 6 i feel like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> overshadowed by final fantasy vii but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone i know who's played final </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fantasy 6 holds it higher than final </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> fantasy xv i've always said the true </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> final fantasy that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> six is the true final fantasy fans pick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah right because it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're not persuaded by like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> graphics quote unquote because this was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the last </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 2d final fantasy iron seven is roblox </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah seven is roblox but people still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> put it on this [ __ ] like pedestal of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> graphics right it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what are you seeing and like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't get me wrong seven is also a good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i also like seven but six was i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know there's something about it where i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this game could look like absolute [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the story and the music and everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just the immersion of getting into this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is so [ __ ] well done yeah where it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't care how this game looks um yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to this day like the [ __ ] battle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing the decisive battle theme from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> final fantasy 6 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gives me a [ __ ] heart on every time i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> listen to it it's like persona 5 and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> final fantasy 6 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to easily have the best [ __ ] battle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> theme music of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any game i mean i can't comment really i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> haven't played any final fantasy so i </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> judge you there's a lot of there's a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of final </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> talked about hating turn-based battles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i am regretting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh not putting i wish i put runescape on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my list now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah i'm surprised runescape wasn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on your list i played runescape that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the first game i ever like had a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> membership </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so good just put runescape on my list </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i want to want to remake my three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by three after talking to you guys about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it i could honestly make a three by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> three of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> each console like did you would you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to talk about tawario at all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> terraria okay terraria for me was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it came out i had already like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> known about minecraft </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because minecraft obviously came out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before terraria why is minecraft not on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here in terrarius </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i thought you liked minecraft more than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> terraria i think minecraft for me is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i like it and it's a game that i can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> always come back to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i don't think i was like as heavily </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> into it as i was with terraria because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think terraria came out when i was in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe like middle school or high school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay and the only ever time where i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would spend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i would not sleep right and be in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a [ __ ] skype call with my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> friends in high school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was playing terraria right like there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were so many nights where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after school you know we'd be on the bus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> home we'd be like all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're playing terraria after dinner yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 7 8 pm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah all right cool we all get on a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> skype call and we [ __ ] play tomorrow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> till like 6 a.m like all right see you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in school in two hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i had so many nights like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> playing terraria right i don't know why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i could have easily done that with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minecraft to be honest but i think it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know there's something about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like side-scrolling games that just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just just tickle my fancy it looks fun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every time i see terraria i'm like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that looks like fun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean was there a point to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> terraria </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of like is there a point in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> minecraft yeah it's like it's kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the point of my i mean there is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually like a story where it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to go through and like there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a bunch of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> story dungeons kind of thing right you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to discover right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there is an end game there's a bunch of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> content for free right oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's always like the chad terraria </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dlc for free yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly i think i have terraria i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i paid for it i just never played it i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really really fun and it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like minecraft for me as well where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if i just need like a game to just kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of mindlessly play and just relax too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then i'll either put minecraft tutorials </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's just a other than that other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than that it is the most vanilla 3x3 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i've ever made i mean like i mean i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> totally understand why it's your 3x3 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh it's this is very much a joey 3x3 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> these are like nine games that i can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always come back to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's probably the most amount of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time i've ever spent on any game i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> wrote down a bunch of other games that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wish i could have put on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i think i did too borderlands 2 i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought was really [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> league of legends oh i pulled it i put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gary's mod on here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe portal 2 mario party 2. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> like he just hated humanity he woke up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and he chose violence yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he would like put it into games where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like i'm sure there's better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> solutions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was like a rowing down the uh uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> rowing down a like a raft thing yeah </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> ergonomics book and just set it on fire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah because yeah like i said with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the rowing one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the the mechanic was you to like go this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way if you wanted the boat to go this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way or go the other way if you wanted to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go that way yeah i'm pretty sure that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if i might be wrong </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> honorable mention for the worst [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game i've ever bought in my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh and i completely regretted it we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> music probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you ever seen this game no [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> garbage game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you had to buy it with a controller as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well so it was like 90 bucks when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were a kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i asked my parents for it because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like wow look at shigeru miyamoto on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stage [ __ ] wagon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get this game and literally to play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the instruments you just like waggle a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> controller and it sounds like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like that's the whole game there's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> whole i'm gonna show you it later you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna be like oh is that the one where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to like conduct </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you can conduct and it doesn't work very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> well at all and then there's one where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you like can play a trumpet and all you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do is press the button and hold the wii </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this i think i've seen and then there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> one where you play guitar and you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah [ __ ] it was garbage i've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like i've seen meme videos of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] oh yeah for me horizon zero dawn i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean i i feel like self-explanatory </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything with a good story and good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> characters fire emblem three houses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i put fire emblem awakening oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that was really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the gameplay more than the story and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fire emblem yeah i i mean i the reason i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put three houses on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is because i'm ah about the gameplay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's turn based but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just fire emblem with persona and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just like yeah literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is this is everything i need yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this gives me a reason to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get uh play through the game uh metroid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pla metroid prime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh cool uh [ __ ] incredible uh and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was one of the few games where i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was totally invested in the world um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it went again what i when i went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> went against what i said before because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you had to kind of figure it out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yourself </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> and uh like you stopped like you had </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> so bad and that's why yeah it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tony hawk's pro skater 2 was the reason </SPEAKER_01>
