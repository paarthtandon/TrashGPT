<SPEAKER_01> take a [ __ ] and then i wake up in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> middle of the night </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's unfortunate being like a white guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who loves spicy food because my body </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> does not agree with it but i love the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> taste of it i mean i suffer the next day </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> you get that as well no i can handle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spicy food but my stomach doesn't like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like every time like every time i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] like chow down on a massive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fat indian right it's like a ticking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time bomb okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know i described like a fat in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> hungary </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's a [ __ ] ticking time bomb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i know because there's there's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> local indian place i order from then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they do it like proper spicy and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> depending on what time of the day i eat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like there's a timer where i have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wait six hours and i'm just like gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this hour i'm gonna be just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> incapacitated on the toilet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's just the way it's gonna be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes when i have it for dinner i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like oh no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm gonna wake up at like 3 a.m </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes because my stomach just needs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to go now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh man i just wa i was gonna say i hope </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're enjoying this podcast guys where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first 10 minutes we're talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> violent shits i just thought you it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> very relatable content hashtag </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> painful [ __ ] hashtag relatable take a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> painful [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> question do you think it's weird that we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like listen to ourselves often </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like because we have to hear our voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> all the time yeah i think that's weird i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean it was weird when we first started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> off right because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people at home have you ever listened to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your like your voice recorded you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> probably hate it right i'm assuming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right i mean i've never grown out of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you're yeah you're still if anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> should be grown out of it it's you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i i hate looking at my own like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hearing my own voice looking at my own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like whenever i do a collaboration with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone i watch like the bare minimum </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just to get what's going on and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i watch every moment of that collab </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i'm not in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just like oh i'm in it skip skip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ahead ah okay okay you're like you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like in the comments timestamps please </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of when i'm not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why wait so why though like why why can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you like i mean okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wait maybe it's the better question </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> asked why can we stand our own voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because that's probably the weirdest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> idea </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you just got used to it right i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> mean like yeah i don't think anyone grew </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and like ever ever went into that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> situation i'm sure every family had it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your parents would just be like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what there's nothing really to watch oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i found some home videos we can watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> those and you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no thank you because i don't know i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] hate it when my parents would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> play home videos in france oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah this is always me being a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] idiot yes but it's also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's also but it's also like the i used </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to have like a [ __ ] squeaker voice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when i was like five years old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i legitimately used to sound like hi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and my dad would always [ __ ] rag me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on me like man your balls really dropped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> all of a sudden </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i [ __ ] hated that because when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're a kid you're not aware that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> have that voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no right because everyone is the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> voice around you exactly exactly and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> grow with your voice so you don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> suddenly be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my voice got deeper unless it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> rapid growth like finally yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just like your bull is just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] dropped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i i thought when it i thought when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it happened i thought it was gonna go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i thought it was like i thought i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> sick or something right right and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone at school didn't believe me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but that's because your balls </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dropped like a [ __ ] cannonball right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mine kind of dropped yeah mine kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dropped like you know this is just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> putting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a rock in water it's just it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a very slow drop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a very slow joke well you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i mean it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because you grow with it especially if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a natural drop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you don't realize that oh i went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from [ __ ] alvin and the church </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we were really talking about the speed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> our balls drops now yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so you don't watch the podcast at all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after we i like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't watch trash taste wow i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> watched like some highlights </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i don't know like because i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with me i'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> super self-critical and i've always been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this way whether it be with my work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or myself and that's why like i'd say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i've i've seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anytime i see like criticisms of my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> videos and my work i'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm more fine with it because there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hasn't been something that's been said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i haven't already said about myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in some way shape or form </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so unless i'm like super proud of a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> video i really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i find it difficult to watch it because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i see all the things that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i kind of could improve on it or that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] hate about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just out there i can't like so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're too much of a perfectionist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't like from one i hate the word </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> perfectionist but you are a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> perfectionist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i i like this i prefer the term </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> self-critical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a self-critical perfectionist is what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you are essentially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like you have an editor but you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> edit your own stuff too right like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> everything yeah you always do like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> finishing touches yeah i always do the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> finishing touches </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and like when there's a collab where i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have zero control over i'm that's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like i wake up in a cold sweat but i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what if i just look like an [ __ ] on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this one oh you know it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so wait so then how do you get through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your editing process because you have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> listen to yourself right over and over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and over again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so are you just like cringing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> internally as you're like ah i need to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> edit this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause you you're doing like you know you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you had jokes you had punch lines yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you not like think damn that was a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> delivery i nailed that delivery </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and sometimes i listen to a joke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i edit it for like three hours and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just like this joke's not funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i just cut it and it's it's it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weird thing where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> depending on how my mood is my video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could just be completely different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i could i could just be watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> myself and i'm just like i hate i hate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this part i'm gonna just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> re-record this entire segment even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though it's gonna add like two three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hours to my [ __ ] video making process </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then i do it see that's why i'm glad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i got an editor that has comp </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i gave complete creative freedom so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i'm pretty sure you were talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about this earlier but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at least with my editor uh he leaves in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i would have otherwise cut out no that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what i like i i tell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anyone i hired edit for me i'm like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't care how bad it makes me look yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just make it funny yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> please make it funny because because the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least right you're gonna get the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> draft right and you're gonna check it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and if it's really [ __ ] bad then you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can just tell them to cut it out but a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of the times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like oh i in my head i was i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought this was not going to make it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into the video but he kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> twisted it in a way where it's like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what that's kind of a funny bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i never thought about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like where i like fail a joke and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like let me do that again yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they leave that in yeah yeah that's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a joke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i guess it's like the difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between like heavily scripted content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and more like improvised content because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there are times when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i have like a [ __ ] banger of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a joke and then i watch it like 30 times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as i'm editing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and i have to like question whether it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was funny in the first place or whether </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seen it so many [ __ ] times i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> lost all like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> comedy comedic effect to me the the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason i asked that question earlier was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i i saw a video i don't know i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know if it was a ted talk it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sounds like a ted talk topic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was something like people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyday people should just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> record their voice and listen to it so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they can improve their speaking in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> general to be more confident right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because that theory was that your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> overall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> general quality of life in like doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything in daily life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> improve drastically if your speaking is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more confident like if your voice is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i agree with you i would agree with that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i think in general definitely like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if there's been the one big thing in my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> life that has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> done me solids it's it's the voice tip </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and talking you know for sure yeah just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> going at it i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i maybe think a lot i'm like oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i guess i'd never really thought about i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know people say oh you have nice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> voices yeah not to stroke my [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> dick but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know that's the compliment i get the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> most right and i thought you were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> putting voices </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the reason i became a voice actor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because people were telling me like hey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you have a nice voice and i thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah [ __ ] you know you what you're right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like damn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i do kind of i'm kidding because when i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> first recorded myself i thought it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sounded like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then everyone thinks that though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right right but then it's one of those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things where i think that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's definitely helped me a bunch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because not only have i improved my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> enunciation and just general </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> patterns of my speech it just made my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whole life more confident by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> doing that yeah because you have general </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> self-confidence yeah because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because if i'm hearing it i'm like damn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i sound good yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that conceited as [ __ ] no no no no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's just you just you get a skill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> set by practicing it right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean like you get you get happy with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the ability that you have to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> change it and make it sound the way you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> want i think yeah and like i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even just being on trash taste and just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like i don't watch every episode that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm in but like i still will have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch like certain clips just to check </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in and everything like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i feel like especially my speaking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> skills has gotten a lot and better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i've gotten a lot better i of course i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so on point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as soon as i say that you really drove </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that point home </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thank you oh my god no i agree like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> used to [ __ ] hate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> public speaking like in school it was oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me too the worst thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and which was weird because i used to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> part of my school's debating team like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we had like a debating team </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know it was like groups of three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and you'd usually go against other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> schools about whatever the [ __ ] it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah we do not have this in the uk i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't think unless you're in oxford </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> cambridge i don't think so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i definitely didn't have this where i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> grew up well yeah i mean it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally just the three of us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and so i was i decided to join that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i realized how much i [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hated public speaking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and how bad i was just speaking in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> general so i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how old are you and you decided to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this this was in actually this no this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was in elementary school so this is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> god damn sixth grade so like eleven </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> twelve-year-old jerry's like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what i have a deficiency </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i would like to improve yeah i'm going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to do that you know you know what like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching all those like squeaker family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> videos man i was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i knew i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so basically yeah so i joined this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> debating team um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and of course like i was in it for like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two years but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was still nervous as [ __ ] like i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very fiddly and kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i had this really bad habit of swaying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as i talked yeah yeah like you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> realize how many subconscious things you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do until you get filmed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah why you should record yourself yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no and that and that's what we did all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my parents sometimes would come to these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> debating things with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other schools and of course they would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> record it just for memory's sake </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and of course i'd be forced to watch it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> during our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> family [ __ ] you know family videos on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the 4k </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> monitor exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> jesus christ i look like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> schizophrenic patient </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm just i'm just [ __ ] fiddling like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so my conclusion is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but you were 12 dude i've already </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> shipped my pants at that situation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the other like schools we went up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> against yes we're just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chatter [ __ ] yes yes your honor let me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let me defend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> myself and my colleagues right here is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like and meanwhile i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have a point but no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was that level it was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> horrible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then so i i tried to use that skill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i first started doing youtube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but of course like everyone's first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> youtube videos it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it [ __ ] sucks and you know i had that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i still have this problem to this day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where i say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like and you know way too much yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people on trash taste the point of that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like yeah take a shot every time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> joyce is like or you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you'll be dead in the first five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> minutes you have like a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like everyone subconsciously has a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of filler words that you don't normally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hear yourself saying because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> filler words when you say it you kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like fill in the gap yourself and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there are times when i say like a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then there are times when i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> swear a lot as well yeah it's either </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know or [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's my three words but also i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sitting there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right you know i'm a viewer right who am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i to be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your company just like too much you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> as if they'd as if they have like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most immaculate speech </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who are you who are you to judge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like do you go around not saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the word like ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in your speech like with any other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> people like i don't know i guess it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is it is it i don't know i i don't get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it because i i i understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that everyone has [ __ ] that they do yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they might want to change </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's somebody my eye [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> why do you need to feel the need to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tell people i guess wow there's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something right yeah you're right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're good you keep talking okay yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but um what were we talking about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so like you know youtube videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fixing your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> speech yeah because i feel like when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when people see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when people see doing stuff on youtube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> nowadays it's like the expectation is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for some reason the expectation is they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> must know what they're doing they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> professionals right right and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really weird because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i remember the first time i felt this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was when i started to get asked to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like panels and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh and i was thinking to myself i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never been good at public speaking my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> entire [ __ ] life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just because i have this audience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this virtual audience on youtube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like conventions and stuff especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expect you to like be in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a top-tier panelist and stuff i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like this is a skill i had to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> learn trial by fire you know what i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because my first few panels were [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i felt like [ __ ] because i was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at public speaking but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you were forced to be put to put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they forced you to be put in that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> situation you just had to learn it on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but i do find it funny that just because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we're on youtube people do have this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> expectation of just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah they must be really confident and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have this professional kind of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> background </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> otherwise how would they get all these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> subs right like you couldn't talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably and they seem to forget that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we all started in the same place making </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> videos in our uni bedroom or our parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bedroom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> parent's basement or something like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my case it's a little bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different because i hated public </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> speaking but i was always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay in front of large crowds which is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weird you think it's kind of character </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't that literally public speaking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no but he's not he's the thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no that's the thing though it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i was doing the debating team stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the most we would ever talk in front of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was maybe 30 people yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right and there's some weird it's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> counterintuitive but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of the times i'm more nervous in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> front of a small crowd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than i am alive i think it's more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> intimate right like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if you have to do it in front of people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know especially yeah i think it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> lot harder because i've done like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i used to do uh classical piano </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> played live at like the sydney opera </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> house once in front of like a thousand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh [ __ ] i'm dropping that like yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> mean i guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that came out of nowhere yeah so yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically i i used to do like musically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> properly yeah um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i got the chance to perform at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sydney opera house in front of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a thousand people 14 15. wow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> um and yeah it was just like yeah you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> playing at the opera house </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like like the opera house like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the asian parents dream right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my mom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did your mum [ __ ] film it and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like frame it and then frame it and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> put in like the safe and stuff yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of course you did of course i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think one thing that really helped me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> realize that should start not giving a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] is that uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and this is just in general life as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that like i think i remember who told </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me this they were like everyone is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> way more worried about themselves than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they ever are about you oh yeah and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you just think about it like that and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> think about how you think about it when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone is public speaking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't [ __ ] care if they're [ __ ] i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just most of the time i'm just sitting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there anyway </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like they can just say anything and i'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably be like oh cool yeah all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like unless they like literally [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> their pants on stage i'm not going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think anything bad of them right right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so if you go into that mindset of okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm going to talk in front of these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> none of them care really [ __ ] it how can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i [ __ ] this up i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> can't be terrible yeah but speech that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel is a little bit different because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if you do [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can very quickly try and fix it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right it's a little bit different when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> playing solo piano in front of a crap </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just dude it's not classical anymore </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's jazz </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you go on stage do you remember the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff you do and the stuff you say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i don't remember no [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like because sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do you still get nerves when you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like a big panel or big event </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no no i get nerves right up until i'm on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> stage same here same thing so like on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> up the stairs going onto the stage i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] nervous </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the anticipation yeah it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like i just want to get this over with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what i mean i just want to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on stage and just do my [ __ ] yeah i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the reason why is because you know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're doing a debate thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no one cares about who you are right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah but when it's your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> your panel right all the people come for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i could sit there and salt them for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 20 minutes they probably like damn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> connor's exactly like he is on camera </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hell yeah it's just as much of an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what i mean like because i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that that's how you deal with like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hecklers right like yeah you just give </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them [ __ ] yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's like oh that was funny you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know have you ever had hiccups at a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> panel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah one time really yeah what hasn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so oh god it was it a [ __ ] hentai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> panel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and oh well that's of course of course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's dude r18 panels i've never done one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's everything i've heard about as a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] horse oh my god i can't if i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't mention this in like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> convention store </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so i do i i offer to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> conventions i'm like hey do you want me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to run a hentai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dubbing panel yeah um and essentially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what it is is i just get a bunch of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hentai and i blow out the subtitles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> terrible at it yeah yeah and that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's funny but eventually you'll get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like one person who's actually like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> really [ __ ] funny right yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what it's for yeah but i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one time i was doing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's this dude in the back he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> must have been like 30 something just on </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> no and i'm like well get the [ __ ] out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then and everyone was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> golf clubs and then they clap like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no because our panels there's always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that one guy who thinks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like the panel was a youtube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> comment section yeah </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> normally at those type of panel the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people loud people are good because you </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> like i'm i'm usually open to any kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] question it is yeah but it seems </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like when people see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> r18 in a panel because i've been i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been to r18 </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> get those it like i don't know what it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is some people just think oh it's r18 </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> that they otherwise wouldn't say i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like no [ __ ] i'm not gonna tell </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> therapist doesn't ask this yeah here you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just asking about the most intimate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] details of my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i mean i've never been on another </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 18 panel but i've seen some of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> questions that has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some of the questions that have been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> asked on our 18 panels it's horrible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's horrible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it just depends on the crowd doesn't it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really sometimes you get real like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> god and sometimes they're quite funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the thing it can be funny but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there are just some people who don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know what funny is like it's funny to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them but then the moment it comes out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yikes you shouldn't have said that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> mean that's like discord humor right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like funny between you and your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> friends but not funny to everyone else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> most of the time so sometimes it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> online humor just doesn't translate into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a real real-life situations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> especially with a lot of discord humor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what i mean you can tell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when someone's been on discord a little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> too much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when they ask questions like that it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like um okay you need some real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> interaction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man i i i saw this i saw this tweet and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i made me think about disco i know i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> keep changing topics here but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was someone who was like um you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't be well adjusted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if all your friends are only on discord </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what do you think about that statement </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is that that is a take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> um because i thought about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh you know and and i i when i read </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i'm like that seems way too like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> harsh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but the more i thought about it the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more the more people i know who are kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i don't know and when i was the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> same when i had friends online i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> think i was very well adjusted when i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> only had friends online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do you know what i'm imagining right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know the you know the picture of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that stick guy he's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that that that was that was my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it sounds so it sounds too much like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a bit of a generalization yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but at the same time i'm thinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> huh of the people i know who only have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> friends on discord and like only have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> friends on discord </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> go to honey epic i feel like there is a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> difference between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> online friends and let's say real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> friends okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you know i say this as someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who has met </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most of my friends online and has found </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my fiance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> online you know what i mean like i will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say that they didn't feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> real friends like until i saw them in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> real life i feel like that's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sealing the deal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because a lot there's there's something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about having online friends where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's always that wall of like how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well do i really know this person you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know what i mean and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could there has been like plenty of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> times where i've like connected with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them immediately you know you guys being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like some of them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and then there are equally as many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> times when i've meet them in real life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wow you were not high and this is weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> now and i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've been there you know what i mean and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel like if you just have that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that first step where it is where it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just the online relationship you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> missing out on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a big part of what it is to you know be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friends and be social and everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um i mean i've always been since like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] age 12 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i would happily get on [ __ ] voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chat and talk to like [ __ ] 30 year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> old man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> why did i do that that's uh yeah that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> context so he invited me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sounds like that chris hanson okay like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when you put like cod zombies right i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would i would gladly get on the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mic and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i would like bully these 30 year old men </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like like i didn't give a [ __ ] dude when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was 12 i would gladly like shout at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people like i would be no i didn't love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that man well i like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like your anger like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> my little brother was was too scared to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> argue people online so when you did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> start to argue with people online and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was in the other room i'd be like oh and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> give me the [ __ ] headset i'm going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> argue you play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so i would [ __ ] shout at them for him </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because he couldn't do it good and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he would lose the arguments i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're not losing the arguments on my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> account right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> over my [ __ ] dead body do you think i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> will allow you to lose this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know i would just because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of those things right where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i would not fall for [ __ ] when i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 12 or 13 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah the [ __ ] that they were trying to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pull right for some reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i knew what was happening most of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time when i was aware because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even from like what's happening i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] playing zombies with them most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the time mostly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chill yeah i mean i don't know i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was it was weird back then because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it just started when everyone started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> voice chatting yeah i think it was new </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and it wasn't really weird yet now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's weird if you do i think it's super </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> weird but back then i didn't think of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as that weird yeah when i was a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but maybe i don't know sure i mean back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then it was like this new thing and now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with so many [ __ ] weird stories </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> coming out you've got to be yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now it's not you know if i had a 12 year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> old kid and i thought i'm talking to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 30 old man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i'd say i'd like be like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you doing yeah yeah but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i i get why people will have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of online friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because most of the time people search </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for online friends because they don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> find that connection </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but it's it's the same thing i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would say as like you know when you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can have like the best friends in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the world but as soon as like you move </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in with each other and live in the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> house that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that like change can change a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> dynamics you know what i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> especially you know you meet someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> especially in [ __ ] uni </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you meet some people you think are chill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as soon as you move in with each other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hating each other yeah that's true and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you see all their little [ __ ] ticks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff that just get on your nerves i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean there was like a i mean i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically been raised </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like on the internet right like ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since like age like 11. i was playing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> runescape i was doing [ __ ] on miniclip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was and i always did not mind talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to strangers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i always thought like i'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going to give any personal information </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i never did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for some reason i was smart enough to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never do anything like that yeah um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there must have been a good chunk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe maybe like a year in my life where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i pretty much only spoke to online </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people like friends that i i thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were like my friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it must have been the maybe first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> year of university it's really weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i never had a concept of an online </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> friend until i started youtube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like i never would get on to like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like we were two different sides of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the coin because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i was always like i would always go on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because because in my head i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why would i talk to this random person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> online when i have irl for instance to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to well that's this oh that's the way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that you go joey's here's where it gets </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sad i didn't at the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and the thing is right is that you think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> oh this is like because i used to see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those those things on twitter because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back then you should see these things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> irl uh online friends or real friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah mom you don't get it you know yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah back when tumblr was like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> pink tumbler </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah and i used to totally agree </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with that because i was like i was 16 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's all i had and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> after i like actually actually got real </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> friends i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh this is what normal friendship </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's like totally different yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's something that like i don't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you realize kind of affects you because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you totally think you're fine and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think you can be well adjusted sort of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> only online friends but it's a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> harder yeah because i feel like having </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that that irl </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh kind of interaction to ground you and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> make sure you're not doing weird things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you're interacting in a healthy way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right i mean because the thing about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only having online friends is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> inevitably you are just living </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in your own bubble it is an online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> bubble right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and you live through what you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> present to them yeah exactly right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're only presenting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one side of yourself for the best side </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of yourself you're not seeing every side </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of a person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so inevitably if you just live in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> bubble you know you might luck out and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be like okay this is actually a healthy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nicely balanced bubble but you know most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it you're missing some kind of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> social interaction yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> social connection that you just don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> get online unfortunately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and i also think because i made a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the friends through gaming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah a lot of the time how you were as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> friends was dependent on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how you were in the game right right and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously i was normally really good at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so i was normally like yeah i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of i'm kind of cool you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was one of those things where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> online when i saw these people like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to those friends i was respected and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they thought wow this guy's so cool you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he just does his own thing and but in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> real life i was a [ __ ] loser </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it kind of made this dichotomy in my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> head where i'm like yeah i'm funny yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm charming and then i go meet up with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people and i [ __ ] struggle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i couldn't i didn't know how to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i hadn't really i wasn't very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well adjusted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and it made me think a lot and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> makes me look back and i don't know it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like how do you convince someone when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're in that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to see it like it when they're in that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sense of i only have online friends how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you make them see that maybe they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not a healthy relic like it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> very healthy because to them they might </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be perfectly happy and fine right and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the thing i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i think it's just a matter of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> perspective right because to them that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all they know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so i don't think um until they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually experience the other side </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like trying to begin and start and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maintain irl friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah they just won't know they'll be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like why would i do that when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this is so much easier and more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comfortable and also i realized as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when i was predominantly spending all my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time online it felt like i could never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> make any progress </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in my life because i i was not investing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> real life right i was maybe i'd go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> work yeah and i would go home but that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was about it right i never made any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> investment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> elsewhere right right i felt like my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> life stagnated because of that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i didn't you know i think when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you make friends i don't seek out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right right because when you make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> friends irl it's not just that it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you miss out on a lot of opportunities </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in general like because you're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> putting yourself out there you're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe other jobs you might hear about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know other you miss out on a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> things i think yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and it's not just as simple as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having friends and having friends it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like there's a lot of stuff that comes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with having our old friends yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i don't know it's it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really made me think a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> recently especially because like moving </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to japan as well it's really made me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because it's been a year right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> since it's been a goddamn year since we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> moved here my god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> already this is this has not felt like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> year at all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> jesus yeah 2020 has been [ __ ] weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to be fair </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> like was like god [ __ ] it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> earth it was like a god sense like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever we'd go here and we'd go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the izakayas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we thought we'd be going to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kinokura every [ __ ] day yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it's like horde not even a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> question of course kinokuro is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> essentially worth the spoons i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we've said that before but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> very cheap very cheap tube yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like 15 bucks for all you can drink for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah something like that yeah but then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you realize oh [ __ ] i actually like my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> liver </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a little bit and i don't want to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> ruin it and i also like good food as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's not got bad food but you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get very average food yeah yeah you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get better food elsewhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i remember like coming to japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like everything i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i in my eyes all food in japan was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then i lived here and now i you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> realize that it's all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's all good but there are different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tiers of how good it can be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah and i'm gonna i'm gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wonder what it's like when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when i whenever i go back to england or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> something where good food is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so much harder to find than it is here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's just readily available </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm getting a pot noodle the moment i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get back bombay bad boy pop noodles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you should just like do the opposite you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> should just [ __ ] commit and just go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to a weather spoons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and just be like i love wet the spoons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> food well then there you go let's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but let's see let's see how it is let's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see how it is i i i [ __ ] with where this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> means </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> food what i don't understand is connor's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] obsession with the tesco </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> meal deals tesco meal dessert you had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one you had one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because i forced you to so tesco meal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> deals right it's a thing in the uk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for three pounds which is about maybe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just under four dollars four dollars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get a nice sandwich a big bag of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crisps and like one of the premium </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> drinks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can get like a smoothie you can get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like an energy drink yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i took you because you got the big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> big sandwich it's quite big and you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a big bag at a crisp you [ __ ] loved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it i remember you were like yo this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all this for three pounds i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's insane right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i think i'm vaguely wrong and i really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like the sandwiches they make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i remember i had the weather spoons that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i had on in some kind of train station </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and i was like yeah that was that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty bad i took it i took </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh joey to the weather spoons in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> victoria station it was terrible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean i i don't think whether this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> means it's terrible i like things on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pub though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it does it does but for the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> part weather spoons is like pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty decent for the price you get yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the one the one there though i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we were i think we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> struggling to find a clean tape oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like longer than actually deciding what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to eat yeah it was gross yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because i remember when joey was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coming to visit me and connor were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> discussing oh what should we jo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what should we show him conor was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tesco murder tesco murdo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm getting him a tesco muted i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> connor for [ __ ] sake nobody gives a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about your three pound tesco meal deal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay right i don't care </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if i become a billionaire you bet i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna be eating mcdonald's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and [ __ ] tesco meal deals until the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> day i [ __ ] die </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that [ __ ] is value and i won't hear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> otherwise and it tastes amazing okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it tastes good i i genuinely don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember eating it like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i feel like i don't know i'm hurt joey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like after living in like after living </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in japan and like living in asia where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> convenience stores just have in my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> opinion just good food to choose from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sandwiches in tesco are better than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan i mean salmon just have like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mayonnaise and like ketchup and all that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] in it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't need that [ __ ] okay you're out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of the question </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where where does all the crusts go in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan where is it where's all the crusts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> gone i don't know probably for some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reason all the sandwiches don't have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> crusts on them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where is it give me my [ __ ] crust i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> love the crust i think though sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i actually that's the reason i like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese sandwiches and some okay in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kid like you can't have mayo you can't </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> i just i just it's just it's just wasted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasted bread that's like tasteless bread </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> tastes like bread oh it's the flavor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> dude it's the best part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what's so good it tastes like cardboard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no it doesn't no it's what yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it tastes exactly like the bread that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like it's like the crust on pizza </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah why why does crust on pizza exist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and why does everyone pretend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's good it tastes good no it doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you eat the pizza </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the [ __ ] bread cheese tomato </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sauce combination why would why would i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to eat pizza </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that is why would i just want to eat the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bread part of the pizza where when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have pizza </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i want the pizza part of the pizza okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's because you're eating it wrong </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right you're going right up to the crust </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you got to save a little bit of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sausage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then girl on the side people think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of a [ __ ] psychopath when i eat pizza </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the way i actually eat pizza at home </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is crust first i eat the crust </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i get i get that taste the [ __ ] out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the way so more um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> then how do you hold the pizza i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> hold it like like what the [ __ ] are you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're holding you're holding it like l </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> dude like you're like look look look i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i just saved the best part to last why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would i save the tasteless part till </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> last i don't enjoy it but you're making </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're making it tasteless by only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> eating the crust </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if if you save a little bit of the sauce </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that sauce could be with the actual </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pizza </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what i mean but this but the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pizza has plenty of sauce look it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like eating the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like when you're having a nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] meal and you eat your broccoli </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and vegetables first and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you and you have like your chicken and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your steak afterwards you save the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> part of your life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you always eat everything separate not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> always if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it like synergizes perfectly if it like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you would know i thought you would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cross the house with the pizza no it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the crust just takes the pizza tastes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like an italian hand on this piece like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it synergizes because when you get those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shitty frozen pizzas right that are like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one dollar or yeah right they're the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ones with no crust </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know those [ __ ] fake deep dish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pizzas that are just all bread yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the thinnest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] horrible that's like his [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dream no my my [ __ ] dream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is like proper thin crust italian pizzas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the the the pizza goes right up to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> crust and it's because it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thin it doesn't take it doesn't get in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it doesn't get in the way sorry you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> got a grip on something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't give a [ __ ] about greasy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hands if the pizza tastes better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's just optimizing the pizza there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is so much wasted space on pizza </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's it's it's like the crust gets in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the way of the pizza taste well then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> okay why don't you do this then when you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get the pizza next time right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a thick crust </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just fold that [ __ ] in half oh yeah no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because that's like that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that means i feel like you're making a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> problem out of this no no no no no no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just roll up the pizza so that it's all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in one thing and then i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i just assume right whenever i see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anyone who you know leaves their crusts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on a sandwich </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or you know leaves the crusts on a pizza </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like your parents clearly didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> beat it into you yeah [ __ ] dude dude if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i if i left crosstalk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my mom would have beat myself she would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> murder me she'd be like why are you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> wasting food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'll be like i got away with a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] but leaving food was not one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> them yeah no that's why that's why if i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have to eat pizza i eat it crust first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um like it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh you make it sound like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> torture man it is torture for me because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're ruining </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're ruining this good [ __ ] food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with just tasteless bread there's only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one time where it's acceptable to leave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the crusts on a pizza and that is a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> buffet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of pizza where it's like i gotta </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> optimize this [ __ ] yeah i don't want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> none of this because it's always [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but if you just have dominoes then you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have to eat this yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> also and also in like crush just takes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> extra room </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> that can be filled with nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tasty pizza i don't want to get filled </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up with like tasteless crust </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> integrity of this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sandwich has been ruined it's it's been </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> you you cut off all the useless pieces </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> although </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> think that will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hit me like whiplash when i return is uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> deliveries here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yes are you speaking of optimized you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get so used to it here because what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happens is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh we spoke about this on the podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before we have i don't think so so when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get a delivery in like i guess any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like we'll arrive between 8 a.m and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 6 p.m </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you just got to be home on a tuesday </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hope you listen out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know and then you [ __ ] miss it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they did a single note yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they didn't knock on the door </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they say that they were there and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and then it's this whole [ __ ] pain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you got to try and reschedule like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh will you come back in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> four days and it's like are you kidding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me i pre-ordered this game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i wanted it today but in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when you miss a package not only can you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reschedule on that day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> within a two-hour time slot so if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> miss it between like 8 and 12 a.m </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is the only four-hour time slot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you can get it re-deliver between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> twelve and two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> four and six six and eight nine ten same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> day delivery literally the whole day and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can pick the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two hours it's nuts and on amazon when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you do it you can also pick the two-hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time slot it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nuts yeah it's so insane and it works i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> mean i mean there are also like what is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the uk and stuff some places have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in london have like amazon now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> insane that's that that's insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i spoke about that in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> podcast i ordered like mario party and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's when it arrives literally a few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> hours after you order it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> man honestly i wouldn't be surprised if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan gets it yeah yeah yeah i mean i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> would love that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because i didn't know i would never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> leave my house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well it was made for groceries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which is weird because i was thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back to our podcast last week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with uh with alexion and i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking to myself man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how would i have survived in japan and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got set up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if amazon didn't exist like like he did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like like when he first moved here and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just thinking man so much of my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> has revolved around amazon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in japan that if i didn't have it i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> life would be ten times harder it does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> become when something isn't on amazon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i've noticed it becomes about 10 times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more difficult yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to get the thing that i want and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> delivered because you have to look it up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and being like all right where's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> closest store and then you have to find </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out when the stores open and then you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> have to go in and [ __ ] look for it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's a mess gross but i also think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i also feel kind of sad because i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because everything is so easy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know and i i i got comments that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't believe kind of complains about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not knowing japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and living in japan right not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> complaining i'm just [ __ ] british and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm just complaining about the things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i complain about i i know it's my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> fault for not knowing jeffy he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not a [ __ ] idiot i know that it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably not a good idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to not speak japanese i think in japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but a lot of people do come here to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> learn yeah right and i do think that if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> forced to you know say 10 years ago or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 15 years ago </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think that i would have been forced to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> learn a lot more oh yeah because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i would have no choice all right right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right now i don't need to do anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> google maps tells you where to go google </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> maps tells me the restaurants </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i can google translate every web page </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like it's pretty much all sort of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's catering more towards </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> foreigners definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it also doesn't help that this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically a society that has optimized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like getting getting the least amount of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> human interaction posture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you go to a restaurant you have a tablet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and you order your stuff you know you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so most of the time you don't even need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to talk to anyone you know what i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is what i like i get you must get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this a lot right do you get comments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> asking you like how's your japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> coming along how's your japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> kangaroo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah gone how is it coming it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is it josu it is i've already gotten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> josie a few times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's difficult right because it's hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to explain because essentially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't i think people have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> misconception of how much we interact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with japanese people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i talk to a japanese person and i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forced to speak japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at like most often at the combini or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the like denny's or whatever like at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a restaurant or a store </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> those are the three most common times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's a script like i know exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what they're going to say yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because they always say i know exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what you mean because we were we were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting coffee like i think it was last </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> week or something at the bookwork </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> offices and we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of ordered the coffee and he almost </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sounded like [ __ ] fluent with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all the responses he was making and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was just and it was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i know how it is where you've ordered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something enough times that you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know the questions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i perfectly optimized ordering </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> coffee it's like when it's like when you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch a movie and you say the line </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> before the action </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like i know what you're going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> say and i know where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if that script is like buried like in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the slightest you just go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just go like i have no idea what the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] i'm doing what happens is i'll be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ordering coffee right and here's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> order every single time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you go in there you say what you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll ask you do you want it to stay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you say to go and then i'll ask you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know do you want a bag </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you say no you don't want to bag and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you just say how you want to pay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so you can just say that right and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always how it is and every time it goes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wrong and if joey's with me i'll just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> slowly turn to joey and be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there's only two times i've seen a slow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> head turn that's in a horror movie and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when i'm with you guys and you it's out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the script </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just a very slow length i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to go yeah i don't want to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> joey help i just want to be like dozojo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll leave it it's it's it's actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> funny when you're not there because when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> something there have been times when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just me and connor and we're out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a restaurant ordering something and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then we get we get something off script </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's both of us trying to keep uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like cumulatively </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> figure out which one of us knows like as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much japanese as each other like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like we're trying to like combine our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese knowledge to be like okay you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know this word i know that word </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so we can let's try and figure out what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're saying combining these two words </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> together </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the thing though like that's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> one like i'm such a [ __ ] sadist but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that's the one thing i [ __ ] love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friends who can't speak japanese i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hanging out [ __ ] and we go to like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> restaurant or something or we go out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> somewhere or go traveling somewhere is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i don't look japanese people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't expect me to know japanese yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i love every now and then going to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restaurant with like a bunch of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> non-japanese friends and pretending i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't speak what a japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i just and just letting them be yes i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh nihongo right and this is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] you joy so yeah outside of you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> those situations i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we pretty much don't really speak to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese people although to be fair </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've been recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] interacting with like japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> people on apex all right well so i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thought to myself right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm taking these japanese classes two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> times the problem is is i'm not really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing much outside of that and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people will be like oh why don't you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> study more i mean the work schedule that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we have is already pretty [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there's only so much studying before you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have to actually use it in practice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right i think like no matter how much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> studying i do if i'm not using it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like practically it's not going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> happen yeah it's not poor so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i just decided [ __ ] it okay you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what i'm gonna i'm gonna stream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> talking to japanese people on apex </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to make friends yeah managed to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> make some friends pretty [ __ ] fast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay even though most people do not want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to talk i mean i was tuning in to one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> your streams and you were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> interacting quite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well i i can speak super super basic and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but they were getting it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah they can normally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understand what i'm trying to say yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the best thing is is that if i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know something i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chat chat what is this word how do i say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this thing and then they tell me and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't forget it yeah because i'm using </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it like a meter yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> over and over and so that's been really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> helpful and if you want to go and watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> those you can watch them on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> highlights whatever they're doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> um but yeah that that's been super </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> helpful but outside of that like we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't [ __ ] use it like i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can you i i can talk to you guys and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> jeff but it's okay joey it's different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's different joey it's because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know how bad we are and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> embarrassing right no no okay okay you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gotta you have to throw that aside </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because like i am fine doing it in front </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of two thousand people live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but not in front of me no not a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> friend because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not gonna judge you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we it's like a subconscious thing where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't want you to be disappointed in </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> i don't know what it is about talking to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a japanese person i i even though it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> even more awkward because if they don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> understand me we're [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but it's less awkward because they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> inherently expect me to be </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> talk more japanese like be forced to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when you moved here yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i i i i i thought i did he said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there was such a remorse like because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so it's weird right because i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone in my life expected me to as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but what ends up happening is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i realized okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i work from home uh i go to a language </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> school where all the staff speak english </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all my friends speaking things yeah oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i stream i i speak in english i go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the gym i don't talk because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who the [ __ ] am i going to talk to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless that hulk guy talks to me yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't [ __ ] massive chat i've told </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that story i think i have right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so yeah there's actually like pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> much no time where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i'm kind of the same as well like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right how often do you speak japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> people outside of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> business right um yeah i mean because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of covert i haven't been able to see my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> family like at all right right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and that as well has made it even worse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because strangers don't want to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> talk to you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly i mean like our neighbor next to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> us uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like really [ __ ] cool old couple </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like every time i see them like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'll talk to them in japanese but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i always get so nervous because the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> moment i start talking to them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i can hear it in my inflection that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> oh no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm [ __ ] like losing touch on this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] like i haven't been i haven't been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> serviced yet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i haven't been speaking enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because all because the only time i'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> ever speak to is like with my mom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like an occasional skype call or [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know it's weird right you live in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like you're losing yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so i have to you know i have to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> consciously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] keep you know figuring out ways </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how can i use this language because if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there's one thing i don't want to lose </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's my japanese yeah of course yeah of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> course and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here's the thing about languages is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if you don't use it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it'll get rusty and that's true with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like mai tai as well yeah now that i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like out of shape yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now that i'm living out of thailand i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like there's sometimes i'm trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to remember entire word when i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> speaking to my mom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and sometimes i get like the japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> word instead because that's something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i've been like studying more recently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really yeah and it's it's weird to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how little i can have to how little i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can use japanese and also live here you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know what i mean because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you kind of subconsciously find a way to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> make it easy for yourself not gonna lie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the one actually like one thing i have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been starting to do recently is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> every time i read manga or a novel a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese novel or something i read it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out loud </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just because because if i read it in my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> head like of course i'm going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> understand it no no no no no no no but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's completely different like reading </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and speaking skills is completely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so i've like just kind of very quietly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> read it to myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just to be just to remember like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's how you pronounce that word </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's like that for me like reading </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> welsh it's like getting confusing now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because i haven't done it in a long time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah and it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean you've seen that washed language </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right it's a [ __ ] jumble of sounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why i don't understand you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people who know like [ __ ] eight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> languages </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some people just have it man yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just crazy right like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't think inherently i i would ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> learn more than one language because i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm lazy as [ __ ] i'll be honest yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean the thing is like to try to pick up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a third is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] my brain is like connor we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> really we're really going to a limit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> here man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really pushing it but but i don't think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> learning language is is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hard per se i think it's just like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if we just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all quit youtube tomorrow for like like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a year and just focus all our time on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually learning this language </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think we'd make like so much progress </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what's hard about it is trying to learn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a language and fit it within our already </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> current lifestyle where we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> busy as [ __ ] you know i mean i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the real problem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's like i'm trying to find </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> time where time doesn't [ __ ] exist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nowadays </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where like it takes a lot of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> time and dedication to that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's a long line between being able </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to speak a language </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> conversationally and being fluent in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the only time i've actually gotten like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> able to be and get get proper </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese practice is when we're [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out on the lash or something we're at a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> random barns like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like we're we're [ __ ] pissed out of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> our heads and that's just a random </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese bloke who's as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> pissed as us that's pretty much been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the best language practice i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gotten since i've moved here honestly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that probably is the best way to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know if you're like a little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> intoxicated then you're going to be less </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know nervous i swear to god i speak </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i speak any languages like 10 better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when i'm drunk except english except </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> english </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's so true [ __ ] man but i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> languages from what i've learned is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> learning a language and learning music </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like an instrument is the exact same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> part of the brain yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's and they say like it's the exact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same with an instrument or language but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the second one is always going to be the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most difficult </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then from the third onwards it just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gets easier and easier and easier and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i guess for all for all three of us the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> advantage is that we already know two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> languages </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> quite formally so that's why and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know you guys are learning a third right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so yeah it just puts pressure on me i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i should learn a third language as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean it's weird because i don't feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like i ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> learned two languages this is the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time i've felt like i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> learned trying to actively learn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something where rather than just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hey this is i just knew this as a kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i didn't really think about it um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you don't think about it in your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> head when you speak time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because because the thing is it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it is very much like learning and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> learning an instrument it's just a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of it's like muscle memory </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah i do not remember how i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learned it i don't remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learning it yeah i just know that i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always been able to understand it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> speak it that's why i hate it when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people ask me like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese language questions i'm like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't [ __ ] know how yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and it's also like when i and also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when you learn a language natively i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think you learn it wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you learn it locally and in a native way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people ask me some people would ask me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> questions about welsh and i'd be like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't [ __ ] know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i i just knew from speaking it yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know any of the rules i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> couldn't do half of them correctly yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's well that's why they say like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> best way to learn any language is to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> live in the country that speaks it right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right right it's yeah i i don't know and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i think i get a lot of questions about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh wait wait which language does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of speak well it's because like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't really get much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> use out of welsh so i don't really show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it off right yeah unfortunately because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only spoken in uh wales and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one part of like south africa south </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> america there's like one small </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> place in somewhere in south america </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they speak welsh like a town </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really weird yeah a bunch of like walsh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> atlas went there and we're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] it let's just make a list let's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> chill here let's just do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a shame because it's such a nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> language it sounds [ __ ] lovely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah it's so cool it's always fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hearing people pronounce the names of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the towns </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah yeah yeah yeah isn't that that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> buzzfeed video where i pronounce </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> it's like shut up son </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> going back to the whole like trying to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fit it around your lifestyle there is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> such a big part of me that's like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man i wish i could take a gear off </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> around youtube for like the past </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> four or five years and then i kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> realized this last year especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was just like hey there are other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> things i can do with my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> other than youtube and learning japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is definitely one of them but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i really only have time to you know do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> without making like substantial progress </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the other or just like making </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> almost zero progress i mean this this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of situation definitely hasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> helped considering that's really limited </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where we can go right because i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> travel as well even if you're traveling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like a bunch of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> english-speaking people in japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just get into you can put yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into situations where you have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> interact with the locals right now yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know just travel is such a nice way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of just meeting people and like getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to use the language as much as possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel there's less stress using a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> language you're trying to learn while </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're traveling because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> at the end of the day yeah you're never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna meet this person again yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> would have no qualms about like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> butchering japanese to an old lady and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] nervous as [ __ ] trying to use </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese at your local konbini right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's like i'm gonna see you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> again probably tomorrow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same time oh my god and i don't want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> be remembered as that gaijin who can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> speak japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right as much as there's a party that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wants to do that i'm like at the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like i'm enjoying youtube now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> more than ever oh yeah i'm enjoying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> everything about it and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's going so well that it would make no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sense to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stop doing it yeah right like because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know taking a year off youtube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> although i could probably come back from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it i probably could but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is it worth the risk like no probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not i can i can always learn japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> later on in life which sucks that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i wouldn't have it now and i would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> rather have it now yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> why not mix the two worlds together i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like i mean what do you mean by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like make some kind of youtube content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> about you learning japanese i considered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that but i thought that'd be such a big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> undertaking and i've seen language </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> channels and they had like drama </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they would like not end up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learning the language </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no joke like they there was this video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where a guy made like an apology video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like technical drama </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah so like oh god cause you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when those videos went around where it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dude speaks 15 languages yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like well that's just absurd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then i i started watching a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> those videos and i found like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people who were like their whole channel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was about them starting from zero </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then learning the language yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and there was like drama with this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because he was learning two languages at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> once right i think it was like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember it was like it was very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different languages as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and about halfway through like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> year in he's like you know what i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> quitting i'm quitting swedish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i realized that it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> hampering my progress trying to learn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> two languages at once right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all that it was like all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comments were like what the [ __ ] man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i can't believe i believed in you like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your swedish was so good man why'd you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like and i was like oh my god anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything can be drama now and i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i if anything it would be a thing where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i would be like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's see how much i can learn in three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> months doing x a week right yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then i would not announce it not make it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a prop not make it a series just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah here we go yeah but at the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> time it also is a lot of pressure that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay i gotta worry about making other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> videos and also actually learning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> otherwise this video is gonna be a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> little awkward if it's like three months </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i learned nothing but that would be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> funny right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it would be like a funny conclusion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to the video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so isn't it like i don't know i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> wasted three months of my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and uh learned nothing he did it for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> good content though you did 30 minutes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of your life watching this video exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] dude because i was because i had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this video idea where it's like because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've always wanted to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> improve more of my japanese as well so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like i can't just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> commit like outside of youtube or like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> outside of what i do and all these side </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> projects i do because i'm just way too </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> busy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now which sucks because i really do want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like you know hone in on my japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so i thought about like you know there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the kanji proficiency test </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah and i've got like i got like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the third highest on that but like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was back in like high school but i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i wonder if i can like go for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> highest one and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how many countries you need yeah for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> highest one uh i believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's three thousand and i think only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> four percent of the population has it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's very like prestigious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah um but i thought like what if i did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a video where i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is there a kanji for cultural </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cross-pollination i guarantee you there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a big one don't worry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i thought to myself like i wonder if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i did a video where i just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> dedicated like a year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to just document myself like learning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that and trying to attempt for the test </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but isn't that scary though because what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you don't make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any progress like six months ago that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the only thing that's stopped yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's also like in order for me in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> order for this video to be successful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've got to [ __ ] grind this [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if i do this and then the video flops </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then that's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cool i wasted a year of my life for a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> flopped video and a test that i failed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i think unlike the actual japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> language i think you actually can like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gamify and speed run kanji </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like i think kanji is speedrunnable i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know man it is dude totally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> explain because you can there's there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lit apps that will like [ __ ] whip you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if you get it wrong all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so i i've speed learned like a hundred </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kanji </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like a day by doing that and i know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> all of them now i can use them but if i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sat you down and told you to write it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> out could you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> write it out some of them right but i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> read them yeah but this i mean japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> read them read them yeah you'll be able </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to read 100 kanji if i showed you 100 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> really 100 percent okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> challenge except i'm tempted to do a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> live stream we're both </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'll [ __ ] do streaming kanji test </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on you the basic kanji </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the hundred countries you know i'll do a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> test 100 we'll do it okay okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> okay because that's like a video idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because right you can you can gamify it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like and and you can start picking up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> patents and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel like the way that you can i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at least when i was when i was learning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kanji i could easily pick up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kanji like i guess um because especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> living in japan right because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it wasn't like living in the uk sorry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you learn this kind of g </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you would leave your house you wouldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see it yeah you leave your house in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> even if you didn't talk to anyone you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see the kanjis everywhere yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could keep practicing because you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> keep seeing them like oh i know that oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i know that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you do do that after like every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like trash taste session yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we'll be catching the train you'll be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what's that science say i've seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that one before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah but i feel like that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> how that's the way you got to do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right right right right because that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's how a kid learns yeah it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> inquisitive yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> problem is where it starts getting into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like there's four kanjis with four </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the same country with like 10 different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pronunciations and it's like oh oh which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like 30 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of all kanji i love the ones with like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> two i'm like nice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> question of you boys uh because we've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been living here for a year now what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how long you think you're gonna be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> staying here for does that mean that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the question i want to ask you too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what's what's what's my five-year plan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was a [ __ ] liar chris board said he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't gonna live here for like five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> years and yeah and he's still here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean time just moves [ __ ] fast it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't even feel like i've been here a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i thought yeah i'll live here for like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two years max i'm halfway through i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like i've hardly even spent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> any time here right now i mean yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the thing like i i always thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to myself i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i thought about i was like oh my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've been for almost five years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah like moved out like moved out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of my parents and like actually lived in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan on my own i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it does not feel like five years which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is why like which is why like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> question of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you see yourself doing in five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> years it's starting to sound less and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> less absurd to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because back you know when i was in my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> teenage years and people were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where do you see yourself in five years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> five years so far you'd be doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> something [ __ ] different every year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah back at that age </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but now it just feels like it's you you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can have like a different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> routine and monotonous now we just sound </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean we are man we are depending on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> how long well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a big [ __ ] question mark obviously is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how long will geeks plus allow us to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here because we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah mainly yeah melinda i i'm i'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> calling you out right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how long so i'm gonna i'm gonna say that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm gonna say this louder so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it all depends on how how long geeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> possibly around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because our visa depends on geeks plus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this wow this is why it takes so many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] sponsors by the way yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we can give geeks plus money so that we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can satiate our [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> lore overlords how many sponsors can we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fit ten an episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> say no more adorable doable man i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay but but i mean like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like the question though i think and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this is kind of goes back to the root of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having been here for a year are you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> enjoying it yeah yeah there's been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i flip-flop a lot in the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> six months the first six months i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i would have one week or i'm like i hate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it i plan to go back in two months </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you know what i mean like there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some weeks where i think especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where i've i said this in my video about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my because i made a video uh about one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> year living in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i think the big point i tried to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mention was like you have to make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you have to force yourself to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actively go out your way to make friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it is not a country where friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just come along you don't just bump into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people and you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's hang out it's like you actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to go out of your way to do the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whole like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when are you free what's your calendar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like let's make the solid not a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing let's do it otherwise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not going to see anyone for two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> weeks yeah you guys right yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like having this podcast has really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> helped because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before it was like okay we might hang </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out every day yeah but then we also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> might not see each other for like a week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and a half yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then i realized i haven't left the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> house in four days [ __ ] i'm starting to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel lonely and i live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i live alone and i've never lived like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> alone alone like i've always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we've always had a roommate i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always had a roommate or something and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and i didn't realize like how much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i like relied on that to like kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> keep me a little bit sane </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah um because you know sometimes my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] roommate uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> zeno i love you but yeah you drive me up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the wall right but that's not that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> also that's also not like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> her fault it was like just a thing of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that that comes with just having a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> roommate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> eventually you just you live with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone long enough you're like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] hate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just the little thing that you do and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have no idea why yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i thought i could live alone and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> then i like one week into living alone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like [ __ ] it's quiet in here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yes i was so [ __ ] depressed when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> started living alone here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right like before like you moved in with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me i was like [ __ ] man i've been out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the house in two weeks i'm so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lonely right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and like am i am i the only true </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> introvert here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean look i like my time alone don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get me wrong right like i like my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> timeline but there's only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so much time i like alone before i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i require the touch of a human oh no i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i i i'm the same because i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before i moved to japan i basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lived alone for like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh like three four months yeah um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because sydney was in america at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we were sorting out our visa stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for japan so there was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like a fair few month period where my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only social life would be when we'd be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> able to like hang out in london </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and i don't know if it's just because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've been in a relationship for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> four years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was just like it was just it was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like nice having </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like just just living alone um and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seeing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> friends and seeing people when i wanted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to um because i guess the big difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between japan and when i was living in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> england is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i could see someone whenever i wanted to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in england if i really wanted to yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you could just message me let's hang out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah exactly exactly i feel like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it was if it was the case of you know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know when i'm going to see someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> next then i would be a way more lonely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um well that's why i'm like constantly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just like filling in plans like a head </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yo you want to hang out you want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hang out you want to hang out late </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> otherwise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're going to find yourself in this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like dead space </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of just no interaction whatsoever yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because like when i first moved here and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i didn't really have anything in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and uh yeah i was just going on tinder </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dates just because i was lonely yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like it sounds so sad but you know what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> do that man i mean and when i didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have you know anything to do i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> bad you know because i didn't want to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to their house every day and be like hey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i know you didn't mind but i also didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i felt like i was intruding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right so and it was just sad you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it took me a while to get used to it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and getting used to being alone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that sounds so sad [ __ ] it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean living alone sorry yeah being </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> you know in my soul </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i figured how to have a healthy balance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of everything but it took me a while </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because i did i wasn't used to it right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i always had someone in my house that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could always be like yo you want to </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> all for replying to oh god </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> mental energy to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be i get it i can look at notifications </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i just i just have to like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> messages otherwise one i just get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> distracted from whatever i'm doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i i much rather i i value so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> having like a just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an in person or like an invoice like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actual communication because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so much that i can't communicate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's just during text that i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i just rather talk to people i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know i feel like i get that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel like a lot of you know a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> context is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> almost lost as well when you're just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> texting as well yeah like a lot it can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like all the emotions can't be like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know portrayed properly yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um yeah and you know i kind of realized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well that the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the friends you'll have in life the ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like i might not text right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like the real friends are the ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it doesn't matter i don't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> need to text them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like even for a year or two i i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> go back and then it's exactly yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's exactly the same the way i see is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's kind of like a family reunion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah i mean and i didn't i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> fully understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the term where i was just like friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the family you choose </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> until i had a proper friend group yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was just like i i remember hearing that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for like my entire life and thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's such a [ __ ] term </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like this like cheesy disney </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that isn't actually real it's a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> urban myth it's a [ __ ] urban legend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it wasn't the destination it was the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> friends we made along the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so with that being said yeah back to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the question at hand which was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how are you going to stay in japan what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you think what do you think boys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right now my main con thing is that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the end of the day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with all my gripes that i had and i i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made them very known as the comments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like to point out that they think i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> despise japan i'm very critical of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything in life yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and uh at the end of the day japan the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> standard of living is just much higher </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the moment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> especially especially when you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> british you just learn to complain about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all the little yeah yeah a lot of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just think that i i really see a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comments like connor's so [ __ ] rude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about japan i'm like no i'm just pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just being real bro it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people just being brilliant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we complain about everything yeah okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> here's a question to you guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so we all are living in the place that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is not where we were born </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did you always know that you would move </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> out of your home country and live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somewhere else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah absolutely i like cause like at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> least for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i moved out of the house that i was born </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so i never moved until i moved out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of my home so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i've been living in that like my parents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> house for like 21 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> years straight and i was just like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's home but yeah it's also like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you go home and you just see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the same view out of the window every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> day right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i need i need i need something else </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i i love my home don't get me wrong yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think especially because i was so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> active online from such a young age yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i became so aware </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like globally of other different places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right and then it just made me curious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i i remember yeah going back to my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] mum </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was just i remember like when i was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kid i was just like mom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm i'm telling you this now love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> england's but i'm going to move out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> three-year-old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i was like you know between like when i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like going from a kid to a teenager </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] knew that i would like move out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of england eventually and i was like mom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't take this personally i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna move out i'm gonna i'm not gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be in the country my mum was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure sure bets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay son whatever you say and i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when i told her hey mom i'm just gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] move to thailand for a few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> years she was like surprise pikachu face </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like nanny you you are actually serious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> all these years and yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like not that i don't love england but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one i wanted to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience like different cultures and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything since i was a [ __ ] kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and two like i i don't know it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was always in my head i was always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking that there was this perfect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> place to live </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that wasn't the place yet that you were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from because everywhere else seemed so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exotic right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything and like the more i move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> around the less idea i have about where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> truly want to [ __ ] settle down it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really weird right because you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially if you live like stay in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place for like any substantial amount of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you see all the great things that that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are there and you also see the bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things there's no [ __ ] perfect place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the more the more you move around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the more you realize there is no perfect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you got to make that decision of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hey where what is what is actually best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for me you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> legit when between the ages of like 12 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and 16 i thought america was the perfect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i thought america was i really i really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wanted to live in america yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all my life until like age and probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually until like i moved to japan i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> still like before that i was like i kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of still want to go to america man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know always since young age i'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always been exposed to american culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i always spoke with americans online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and i just really loved their style </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of doing things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yes i love how [ __ ] crazy they are i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know i think i i think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because for me it's like i didn't really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like interact with any americans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i think that's the thing right because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like literally from age 12 i've been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chatting with people online always voice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chatting like my parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason didn't stop me and most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and most of the online friends you got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were just from america right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah a lot of a lot of the people you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were friends with were from america i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was the token british friend most of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> time they were like it's [ __ ] corner </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> you go on holiday as a kid right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you got to follow what everyone else is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and you i always had i always like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> had this [ __ ] especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if i go into like a big group like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> stacked [ __ ] itinerary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well all i wanted to do was just stay in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my [ __ ] hotel room and playing my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nintendo ds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's all i wanted to [ __ ] do on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> holidays dude because we used to i used </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to go camping uh for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh in france like i said every year for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three weeks right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i in most years i [ __ ] hated it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and my parents thought that i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they thought it you know okay i get it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now what they think they're like oh he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just saying he hates it yeah you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what i mean like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he's just that's a knitter no no i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually hated it like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like you were in a tent you were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sleeping on the floor it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uncomfortable so it's like three weeks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're eating the same [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> everything okay so everything is grilled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on a barbecue i love i love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> camping don't get me wrong i used like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my dad used to take me camping like in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] australian outback like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> all the time but it wasn't for three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> weeks it was like tops like five days </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the thing right i think three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weeks is way too i think that's what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like has completely put me off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> vacationing in any places that aren't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> honestly just like relaxing in a nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> bed yeah just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> eating nice food like that kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> put me off for life because i spent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most of my childhood summers just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sleeping on the floor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eating everything that had to be grilled </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because that's all you had to cook </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right it was a grill baguettes non-stop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then always always those horrible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> public showers that are never clean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then sometimes you would see like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> piss in the corner and it would always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> smell and it was just awful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like everything was awful and even as a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 12 year old i could be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm is this some peasant joke i'm too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> rich to understand right like i i just i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i really like that that would throw me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> off i would always be like at home we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had a toilet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was nice and it didn't stink of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> why does it here i i also wonder how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different my perceptions of a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> these activities would be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if i actually went nowadays </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with my mates because three weeks like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah part of part of the reason i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like look back and dread about it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because you spent it with you were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> forced to be there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with like your family and something you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wanted to do something else </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that your family didn't want to do and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like that's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that that kind of memory has been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ingrained into me that i just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i hate this activity because i did that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] as a kid and i hated it yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because my parents were obsessed with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maximizing the [ __ ] out of the day like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i was like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> let's let's go if we go in france it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah let's just walk around this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> town all day and i'm like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no i want to go to the arcade all day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't i do not want to walk all day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like i'm starting the age where walking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just hurts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all day right i don't know like for some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason when you're when you're a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like walking long distances just doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> work like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were you an active kid 100 like yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was doing sports two three times a week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but for some reason just walking when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had to walk all day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just pain which is pain man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then when you're a kid right there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing more boring than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fishing and i would have to do it that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> true and i thought i'm glad my dad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never got me into fishing like my dad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] destroyed something that i could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see me enjoying now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with a mate and drinking a friend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've actually been fishing for the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time recently which is like two years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ago with uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sydney's dad and sydney's uh brother </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> took me fishing for the first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i actually really [ __ ] enjoyed it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right right as an adult it's one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> those things that like as a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just not wired yeah okay okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're they're it's gonna make me sound </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so bad but there is one big difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about why i can enjoy it now versus what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i could enjoy as a kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's because alcohol is now on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i have never seen a man fish with not a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> beer in that little pocket yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah it just doesn't happen because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean it's not part of the charm yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going it as a kid it is just like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the adhd simulator because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all you want to do is like why is there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> enough fish catching on this immediately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm trying to get this [ __ ] thing on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the thing on my [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah where's my nintendo ds i need to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] cook your mama for 20 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> relax </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're trying to do it and nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happens you get [ __ ] fish and as a kid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like let's let's kill it and eat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it let's let's do something yeah let's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's [ __ ] [ __ ] decapitate this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fish and then that your dad's like we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> throw it back here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's the point i want to eat it you </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> like camping without all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> frustrations it's like camping with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> privilege it's like coupling with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> civilization like if we didn't if we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't want to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> invent all this [ __ ] we wouldn't happen </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> a [ __ ] bag or a hole in the ground </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with there's a reason there's a reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] humans evolved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and invented toilets in civilization </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have you ever wiped your ass with a leaf </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what are you gonna do grab a handful of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> grass no you have to use leaves and hope </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can just get most of it out it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> awful well that's why like the one thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we always took camping was a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like a bunch of toilet rolls damn dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 20 20 man yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because what you just you go out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into the bush you'd wipe yourself i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put it in a bag and then you throw all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i must have been as like 12 year old me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like instant noodles or toilet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rolls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> chicken flavor or poopy butt like oh god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it was i do remember when we did it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was awful because like there was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of kids that were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just not prepared at all yeah and had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never even done any hiking at all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right and those those things are heavy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah and a lot of them just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't do it and you had to stay as a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> team </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's like every 15 minutes one kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> would have a [ __ ] mental breakdown </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and it was like i can't do it i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so the only thing that like puts me off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> camping in japan from what i've seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like only only like the pictures and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything i've seen is that it looks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> how can i say it's commercialized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's it's like you have this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like camping sport and like i see a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bunch of tents there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's very privileged yeah yeah and i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like you're put right next to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and it's just i remember the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um i remember about camping is just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> little noise protection you have from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> one intent to another right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you hear everything yeah right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the what i you know especially the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> camping experience i would like to have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like a bonding mate sesh like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially if you have like a bunch of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese people around you with tens and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone values their privacy can you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine how quiet you'd have to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh we could just be those like ignorant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gaijin just be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know if no one's making noise at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this campsite i think we will like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what are they gonna say you just hit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 2 a.m just like aggressive uno </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> noises </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like from drunk people </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> i'd be down there i'd be down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know it's it's all about i'd be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> willing to do it now is it for content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay i'm willing to [ __ ] suffer for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> content whatever i am </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i am i am that's that's that's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> tipping point right at least like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'll do it but is it monetized </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> wishlist now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is just us fantasizing and covered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> times yeah i'm just kidding remember </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> could travel to places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i do want to go back home and visit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my family because it's weird because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this will be like the second </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> christmas in a row where i haven't seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them which is normally would be the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing where it's like okay i'll go back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for christmas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you know um but yeah i mean that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's one big thing but as far as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> living in japan goes and i mentioned on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know the quality of life being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really good here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i definitely felt like at least another </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> two years i want to stay here yeah and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think it'll be a case of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a year i'll know if it's going to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> another two years it's one of those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> things where i i'll just as it goes i'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> keep changing that number </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's how it is like from like with a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of my friends who are from overseas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who live here or have been living here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's always the case of you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right we'll give ourselves one more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> year see how it goes and then usually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 90 of the time after that year ends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> another year and then it just keeps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going right and it's such a pain to move </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] back it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's worth the like i really can't be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bothered with that again but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do you guys feel this as well i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know if you guys feel the same but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for me this has been the first year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what i do actually feels like a career </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as opposed to just me just being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> self-employed doing my own [ __ ] job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i mean i've never been employed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah yeah once all this point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just feels good it just feels like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for for the first time this isn't just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a job it's like my career now yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um i don't know just you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you you don't think doing like doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like youtube and your job that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> environment really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> matters because you can do technically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do it anywhere but the more like i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> done this and the more i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> growing up the more i realized hey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> environment really [ __ ] matters in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in your works oh yeah like i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going like i remember in university </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where i'm just like i can do youtube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wherever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i can do in my in my [ __ ] room you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know i can do it next to my bed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then i slowly realize i need my own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] office i need my own [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> space </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i i need to separate you know work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and my leisure time because you can you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can like you can survive with it and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can do it but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just there there'll end up be a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> point where you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] depressed and you get tired and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you just it's not healthy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know yeah yeah i mean it definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> completely changed my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> productivity but also just like my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enthusiasm towards my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> career and i guess like it really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cemented the severity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of what i do of like this isn't just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a little fun thing that you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> paid for like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is this is your job right now this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is your career like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> putting food on the table is this now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything you do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> revolves around this and definitely you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like moving to a bigger place and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting my own like actual work room has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like really cemented that like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah this is like yeah i can [ __ ] around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on camera and be silly and goofy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but it's also my job like i can't i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> can't half-ass this [ __ ] like i need to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> be serious about it but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's brought on an entirely different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> layer of enjoyment that i otherwise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would have never experienced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i don't know like i think it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because as well like all the topics that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we cover of like you know the kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> otaku </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of stuff and like anime kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff where it's like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing it here as opposed to anywhere </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> else is just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i think completely different oh it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> totally is like one one of the biggest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things i've like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realized this year is a lot of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mystery </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of like the mystery and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> prestige not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not the prestige like the mystery around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like the anime industry itself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has kind of like it's it's i see the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime industry totally different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i remember before like i moved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here and you know you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as as a teenager as a kid you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe maybe i could like as a dream job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i could work in anime once yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like you have no [ __ ] clue what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> steps you need to take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i thought you had to be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> incredibly [ __ ] lucky and like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more i meet people who work in this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> industry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the more i realized oh you just need to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be here yeah you know what i mean like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you just need to be here and know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one person yeah and that's enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and sometimes you could [ __ ] look up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a job on craigslist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes you you know you just you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like teaching english or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something or something and you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happen to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in person you just happen to stumble </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> upon someone who has an opportunity it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the biggest advice i can i can give </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> now if you are interested in working in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the japanese anime industry it's just to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] be here because it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've been surprised at how like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes even how low the bar of entry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is because it's like the bar of entry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seems to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay yeah university degree but that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like the minimum you have to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a visa but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> aside from that it's just kind of being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here and just hanging around the right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely notice that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i didn't think i just didn't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it worked that way you know what i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i i thought it was just like closed off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to all kind of foreigners and anyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> else or it took like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> years and years of building yourself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah and we go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you go to those anime studios and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just meet a guy who's like i'm american </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you are so how did you get how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did you get this job because it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you think you you think they just had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like the craziest [ __ ] journey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> craigslist yeah yeah i mean yeah most of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the time it's just yeah i was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> teaching english and i just saw a job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> posting for a random anime job and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> went for the interview and i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh wait it was that easy this entire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> did you even speak english it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> literally the mcdonald's method </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i see an ad i'll apply for a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] why not yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> get the job oh yeah oh okay i got the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> job cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i don't know i i i guess totally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> agree with that in terms of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the mystique around it it's kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like slowly peeling away right right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but yeah i don't know it's it's hard to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> summarize all my feelings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about living here and working here but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah definitely the structure has been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> added </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and i don't know if that's because of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan or because of how we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scheduled and built our work optimized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> having an agency here uh that works with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> us and works with anime has been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> super helpful yeah um and has helped me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like a lot more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you said structured because before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i was just kind of [ __ ] around i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think and i was just hoping that the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> checks kept coming in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i was like i'll just keep making </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff that i really enjoy it didn't feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah no and i assumed that every i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> assumed that every year could be my last </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and now i'm starting to think okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> well you know if you know as long as i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> don't do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] anything stupid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> as long as none of us get cancelled yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know you know you're probably gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> be around for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a little a little bit right yeah you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can normally safely assume i've got a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> year left in this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right like you can probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally plan a year or two right and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know and and some people like well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> damn shouldn't you be working in like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> proper career and whatnot like what is a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> proper career anymore like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bro some people like still dr like 50 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> years old driving ubers like is that a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> career like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why why people got to make a thing about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it it's just your prerogative right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like whatever makes you happier if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're getting the money and it's making </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you happy you're not hurting anybody i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think that's a proper career yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the way i see it as well is that like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason youtube falls through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know in a year and i got nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> left like hey man i've got experiences </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people could like kill for right right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> all three of us have been smart enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to kind of establish ourselves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in you know fields outside of youtube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my plan my plan b used to be go back to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the bbc and get like uh go back into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> engineering </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff but now like if youtube falls </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through like i have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i have other plan b's of like other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> businesses i could possibly get involved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in and that's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's gave me it's given me like in in a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> career that really shouldn't have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the feeling of any kind of job security </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i do feel secure that yeah i do have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a specific skill set that working in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing this has given me as opposed to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five years ago when i'm just like what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] can you learn doing youtube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what what the [ __ ] could i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually learn how to edit a video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like like like you know when you you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> look back and you start doing youtube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just think what can i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> possibly put on myself i'm getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing out of this what can i possibly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> put on my cv </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and then now you're like if in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> terms of social media entertainment and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> marketing it's like it's it's a big list </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah absolutely yeah i think i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know a lot of people think is uh on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most youtubers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as uh you know like the [ __ ] dumb </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dumb college dropouts i mean you do see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of them who are like [ __ ] i'm in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the same category as him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right but i think what people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that there are a lot of companies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that wish they had people who understood </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those kind of like because a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> companies you'll see them man they don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] understand social media </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know if you know if what if we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did lose our job there is a good chance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that we could probably work in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a company and be ahead of their social </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> media department or help with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> strategizing right consulting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> anything right i mean it's like dr </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> disrespect right he was an online </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> creator and then he went to work for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> uh i think activision right or infinity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ward and he was the head of their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> community relations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh really yeah for a while oh wow before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> before coming back to streaming yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before he came back that's what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he left because he was a big cod </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> streamer i believe right right and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he left to go and be there community </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> related uh community management or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> something along social media </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it speaks to even back then that someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who had just been doing videos online </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who seems very amateurish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you know that knowledge that you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gain is so invaluable and companies wish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they understood that and they could hire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as many teams as they want but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right because it's so rare especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for someone like you know disrespect to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> reach numbers like that right it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> something that you can like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not something that it's like well i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> got a degree in it i studied it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> therefore i'm gonna get results like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that just doesn't happen right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you learn a lot through youtube and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think that even if you are doing it as a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hobby now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh and you don't see any potential in it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think the skills that you're learning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are really really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like useful skills i don't think you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> realize useful yeah one one thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one important skill that i had to learn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how to do is kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> realizing what skills i thought were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> useless and were actually not useless </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's actually thinking back to be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah i do know how to do this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is actually useful in some way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's it's like part of part of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> part of making yourself look sellable as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a person to any employees </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what skills have you have you got and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what like experience do you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and what like we we grew up in like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> generation or at least like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially with asian parents where we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were taught hey do well in tests </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get like your degree go to university </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and if you don't go to university you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a [ __ ] dropout </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and you're scum you're not like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the older they grow i grew up the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more i realized yeah if you have like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> certain career options </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and certain like career paths that you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> want to go down yes a degree is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely you definitely need that but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you kind of don't know what you want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do yet that doesn't mean that every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other skill set you gain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is invaluable right you don't need a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> degree to make a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> plan b in your life right yeah it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i never i never learned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything about like business or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> marketing in school like i didn't take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any of those like classes i never did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and i learned so much about that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of [ __ ] just from doing youtube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and that's like a really valuable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> skill to have but i didn't need to go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> school for it i just had to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> do it yeah i just had to go through it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and experience it because it's the way i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> see it right i have an engineering </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> degree yeah if you put me in an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> engineering workplace </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i wouldn't know [ __ ] yeah exactly i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know what's going on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe i you know i understand i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> understand the rough concepts that make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up a lot of basic engineering and yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably teach me a lot easier but you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> couldn't just plop me in an office and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> do it yeah i would have no clue yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah at all because you have to learn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how that that company utilize that skill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right right right and and without using </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it practically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like what am i doing i've just got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good at tests like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was [ __ ] and i constantly got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> frustrated because i never felt like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was learning engineering although i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was i was learning the concept i felt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a lot of it was so impractical </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but i mean you were learning it through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your head but not through your body </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah i think i mean we weren't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> using it yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we learned it's like why this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> important they tell you but it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] like have you guys ever had like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a proper real job interview </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything like that yeah and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well yeah was yours for mcdonald's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no no no no for like it was like like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> real job oh okay so like when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> before i decided to do youtube full-time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah uh i was actually still applying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for engineering </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jobs because i was going to do a year in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> placement right which is uh in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in i don't know if they do this in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> australia you could basically after your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> second year in the uk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh you have an in industry yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically working yeah you get paid to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> work and you normally it's normally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> those kids do really well in third year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as well because they come into it with a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot more like like an internship right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> practical experience yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like kind of like an internship yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah an internship that actually pays </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> well and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you normally get a job after it like out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there normally normally they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get the job offer for that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> placement after your like year ends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and some of them might even offer to pay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the third year and the masters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so it's like it's kind of like no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> downside to doing it especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> engineering right it's really good the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hardest part is getting an offer in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> first place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's really hard to get a good place to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> take you yeah i remember i did tests for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> rolls-royce and stuff and they were hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like they were making </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> every single one of them it was so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> annoying you would apply for it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they'd make you do this in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like an hour and a half long test that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was hard as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and eventually you just got to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> point where you're like i've done four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in one day and it took all day and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know i'm not gonna get any of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah let's be honest i'm not smart </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> enough to work in rolls-royce's jet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> engine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just gonna be honest dude that ain't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me you know and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i had an interview for one and i i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> remember them asking me questions and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] i can't even like stomach the lies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i can't even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i can't even i don't even have the you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't even have the business </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i care so little about actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> getting this job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i couldn't even sit there and lie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to the guy yeah like i would in a normal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> job interview i would be like of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i i never really like worked any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like before youtube became a job i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like i told the story of how i tried for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mcdonald's and failed and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think i did one internship like during </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uni but at that point like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> youtube was kind of becoming more of a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> priority that i knew i probably wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna go into this field </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anyway yeah but like i'm not gonna say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the company name but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> last like two years or so i've been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> approached by this like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> relatively big company like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> international that like really wanted me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> oh okay and that was the first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where i went into like an actual like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> proper job interview yeah but i didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do one interview </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i did 17 interviews holy [ __ ] not to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> mention </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i did some here in japan and then i also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> did some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in l.a 18. yeah i can help i did some in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> la so like when i was like staying at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> aki's place in vegas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they like flew me out to la just to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do like six more interviews oh my god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well then i had to fly back and uh at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the end of the day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i didn't get the job so i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> really fun but like i'd like to think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that after the 16th interview they were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know i don't think so but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> let's try one more time and it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a different person every time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as well yeah so like but but this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a pretty big comment like i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty sure i'm not allowed to say who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but like it was a pretty big company </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and and it was like it was a company as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well that i was really interested in as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well because it's like oh like if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> youtube falls through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is a perfect place to work yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like hell yeah like this is my plan b </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and so i was genuinely excited to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like maybe i might get this job i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but yeah it was just [ __ ] but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think that just made it so much more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> stressful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i remember oh sorry because it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like because i was genuinely interested </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how do i like tell that to the person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without sending like an absolute kiss </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know yes i love everything you do of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> course i want to work for you if you've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> got that job would you have quit youtube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hard to say wow i can't say now that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with the place you're at on youtube i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every person in their youtube careers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought maybe i'll get a proper job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i don't know when this will fall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was it was at that point where i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i give myself a little bit there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of anxiety and a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh what's the word like you you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> trust it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like you don't think you think it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> temporary yeah even though you know it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not yeah there's always that gut feeling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i think i can understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know some people youtubers want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> move on and want to do something else </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i understand that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't have that interest right now and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't want to move on cause i'm really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoying it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know i could i can i'm starting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to understand after doing this for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i can understand the mindset of why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone wouldn't want to be in that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> coin flip every day is like well let's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see if i've got a job today </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah it is kind of like it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> really stressful to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i think that i've just become used </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to it yeah but if you put someone in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this situation overnight i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's one of those things where it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh they wouldn't be able to handle it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe not handle it but it would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely it would definitely wear on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah absolutely going back to job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> interviews i do have like a story of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very first i'd say real job interview </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you know i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i've had job interviews for like co-op </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and like call centers and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we're talking like they just want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> make sure you're not a [ __ ] criminal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly all you have to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is just be a competent person and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somehow joey can couldn't even be that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for his mcdonald's interview but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's a different story but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're talking actual like big boy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> companies okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're here for a specific skill set so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is like before i got my job at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bbc so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as you do as a graduate you apply to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about 10 [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 10 million different companies you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hope one of them sticks yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one uh one company that actually um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> called me back for an interview was a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> missile company </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so i would basically be kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah like what other missiles are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there joey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know it just sounded really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weird it's like a company that makes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> missiles like what sound missiles make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so yeah what would you do yeah i design </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get down the missiles are coming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah it was a it was a proper </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> missile company and i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh applying to be like a systems </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> engineer to like design and make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> missiles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so like obviously i go in the i go in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the interview and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm [ __ ] i'm [ __ ] nailing this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interview okay i i i can't i can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember i can't remember how it is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the interview was split up into two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different segments right like there was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the one where like they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like into your like personality and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know i can't remember what that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> called no there's a technical term </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah there's there's there's one whether </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like they you know they grill you about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why why do you why do you think you'd be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a good fit for this company </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you say you're a [ __ ] team player </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you're a perfectionist to uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> one of my weaknesses oh well you know i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just uh i'm i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um i love money i love money i i am a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> perfectionist and you can't [ __ ] say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look i just need money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i need to pay off my [ __ ] student </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> loan why are you asking me questions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you know the [ __ ] answer to okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so but like i i breeze through that and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i know i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they've i know i'm doing a good [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> job right and then i get to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> technical interview </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the technical interview i actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> prepared for this right because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i'm working for a [ __ ] i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> applying to be a [ __ ] missile </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> designer so i should probably know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basics of how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a missile works right and sure enough i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get to the technical interview </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they ask me um so can you explain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> broad basics about how a missile works </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so they go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no so um i've mentioned this before but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my degree is in electronic and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> electrical engineering so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was um so basically this this was this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was going to be a breeze for me i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how a missile works so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i've done my research yeah yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um i start so there's two interviewers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> older serious guy and then there's one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like younger not exactly a grad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> graduate he's been there a few years but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like he's like at the time he was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> late 20s early 30s yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i start like i start explaining how this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> missile works so there's like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whiteboard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like so i draw i draw the missile </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and and i'm like i'm like explaining </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> explaining explaining everything i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah together this system does this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this isn't on this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so my final year degree project </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my thesis story was on like object real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time object tracking and everything like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that so perfect perfect for what i need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> explain here so i start explaining how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this missile </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like tracks different objects so i draw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this rectangle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i label that target and then i draw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a dotted line </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from the target to like this missile </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i've drawn </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> thinking when he was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drawing on him yeah this this this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like i didn't realize how much it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looked like a [ __ ] penis </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until that's a straight up johnny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it is a [ __ ] girthy face </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as soon as i saw that as soon as i saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i knew i failed not because not because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was doing a bad job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know when you're in the zone and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like there's not there's nothing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that could take me out of the zone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knowing that i've just drawn a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> penis into in front of two examinees </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then after that i just start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stumbling and i forget everything i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> prepared </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right you failed that time yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> they specifically said that i did super </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> super well on my like the personality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> side of things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but uh the technical side was lacking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i had totally blocked out of my mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that there was a they ask you technical </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> questions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i think i was so [ __ ] bad at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it right yeah because i remember i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had a question uh and it was asking me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like they were asking me like how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> turbines work i knew how they worked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but you know when you're in a room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like two really old men who've been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> doing this for years and they ask it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like they're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how do you [ __ ] tell me how you [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> describe how you [ __ ] what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like it's like i know how to shoot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but when they're looking at me like that </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> that you wouldn't get an interview </SPEAKER_02>
