<SPEAKER_02> - Shut up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (gentle music) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Welcome to this
episode of "Trash Taste", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I am the boy, the big boy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And with me I have big boy
chungus and small boy chungus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why am I suddenly the fattest one here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I was gonna call... Okay, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I haven't seen either of
you at the gym lately, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what's
been going on with that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but, you know, I am very disappointed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, who was the one
that got a C in cholesterol </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the fucking like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are we gonna start adding
each other that, really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, let's do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wanted to open on
that, 'cause you know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was doing my usual
"Trash Taste" schedule </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and shitting on the toilet,
literally before recording, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I get a phone call from Sydney, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and she said, oh, "I finally
got my health results back in," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Congratulations,
what'd you get Sydney?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And she got all A's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How the fuck is Sydney's liver an A? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like fuck off Sydney,
fuck off you got all A's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How is it that she gets all A's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and yet I got a C on my liver? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I'm probably the
one out of the four of us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who drinks the least. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, so to give context
to this conversation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So a few weeks ago, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you are a regular "Trash Taste" viewer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you would know that we had our, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> biannual or annual health check? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Annual. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Annual health check, and I didn't know- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is something
that a Japanese company </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> forces every employee to do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they have to go for a checkup </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the company also gets the results. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so we did our health
checkup a few weeks ago, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I talked about it on "Trash Taste", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and we just got our results back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And this is the first time
I've ever gotten results back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> from like, you know,
getting my health checkup </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a foreign company, country sorry, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I did not know that you get graded. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'm used to seeing numbers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and them saying like, "Oh, this is bad." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, oh well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it's just a funny
number, isn't it? 220 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Literally, I got my health checkup </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, wait, they
are literally grading you ABC? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like an end of year school report. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I felt like I
was doing my GCSEs again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or A levels, I'm like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And normally I don't really care too much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about my health checkup 'cause- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Unless it's bad.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unless it bad, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You see numbers, you see
the doctor's suggestions, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're just that, they're
just doctor's suggestions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I don't know why, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seeing my health being
graded like a school test, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it just brought the Asian
blood out of me, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I definitely
felt more competitive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - With my body. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I was going
through my health checkup </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and overall I got a B,
so I was like, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I am a straight A student,
what the fuck did I do wrong? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's no B Asian, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, deadass.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In Asia B means bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Deadass, the first thing
I did when I got my results </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was I phoned up my mom and
told her how well I scored </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in this exam, like a good Asian son would. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I called up the doctor, and
I was like, just to check, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this wasn't ranked, was it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This was casual, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is free play, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Please say this was psyche, please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, but I mean my results,
I got like all As, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which was great, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I should expect from someone
who is under the age of 30, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're generally supposed
to be quite healthy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I got a B on BMI, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> which, I mean, obviously I'm
built a little different, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and this is Japanese BMI </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which I believe is slightly different, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if I'm led
to believe that's correct. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I mean, BMI is bullshit
anyway, a load of shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is 100% muscle not fat, don't at me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I got a C on my cholesterol. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ooh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I got like a... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, I'm not sure how
cholesterol works exactly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I don't know shit, I'm dumb. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So they have like three
different collaterals, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and all of them were
like a little, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> all of them were kinds
out of touch, if you will. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right
- [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I was like, in my head I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well they gave me three
Cs now for my cholesterol, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, but what are the odds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of one of these cholesterol being good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and the others not being
good, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I had amazing cholesterol, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the other two aren't gonna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well, fuck, we better pick it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I don't know, to me it was odd. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mine was worse because
I got a C on my liver, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think a B on my heart
rate monitoring or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- Oh, really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And everything else was an A. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- What does that mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the thing. It's
like, usually on your thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think you too got like
a doctor's note, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mh-hm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you guys get a doctor's summary? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you can ask when you get the thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if you said yes or no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can ask if you want advice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I said, no, I don't want advice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I said no either,
but I still got like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if it's
the same doctor's note </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we're talking about, but
it was just like a summation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of the test results. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which didn't explain anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it didn't explain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It just said some of the values are a bit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, abnormal, which is, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> higher or lower than we expect, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there shouldn't be
anything to worry about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't even get a summation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you not? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mine literally, like overall, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I got a C and the summation
box was just blank. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, mine too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So what, you're just gonna tell me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that my liver is bad and that's it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Should I be worried? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like context would help, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you get a note that
said you had to come in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three months later as
well? Like Connor did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did, I got that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They told me to go back in
three months, but it's optional. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, on the thing it
says, like if you get a C, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they recommend you come
back three months later, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> although I didn't get a note </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saying that I should come back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mine said you should
come back in three months, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you have to pay for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And also, you know, for cholesterol, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm obviously gonna turn up
and they're gonna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, you should exercise
and eat healthy." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Thanks Doc." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was gonna ask, 'cause I heard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're back on the chicken
and broccoli diets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I haven't gone right back
to the chicken and broccoli. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have started eating a little more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> health conscious though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it because of the test results? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it helped, helped
me be a bit more conscious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It made me, you know, when
you would maybe just go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the karaage, or
you'd go for the chips? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It made me like second think,
like, do I really want it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I definitely
have like stopped drinking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I've only drank
like once or twice since. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is the liver, 100% all
problems come from alcohol? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I feel like it's not just that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there's gotta be a whole
host of other things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's probably not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause the problem with
the test results is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they gave you the grade
but they didn't tell you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how to improve it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I guess that was our bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause we literally ticked the box </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that said we don't want doctor's advice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I had assumed, like
any other health checkup, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it would just be like, you know, the- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That you're gonna be good, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it was just like the generic, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, are you doing well? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do I need to go to the hospital </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to really have a lifestyle change? No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But as soon as I saw the fucking B, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I got a B in my blood, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like how the
fuck do I improve my blood? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> What am I doing wrong?
Why is my blood a B? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just improve your NaN?
Just like control it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause they were like going on like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, the white blood or T-cell, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not a fucking uh, I'm
not a medical student. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I saw the numbers, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I just saw the A, I was
like I'm (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I saw the B and I'm
just like, as an Asian student, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, 'cause whenever
I saw a B in a test, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, okay, I can
improve this test score. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can study a bit more, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can optimize this a bit more somehow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What I found interesting was that like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I always thought to myself that
I was very deaf for my age, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because I went to a lot
of concerts growing up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just basically destroyed my ears </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> through headphones and shit like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was expecting, on the hearing part, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I maybe get like a
B or something, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't even have complained about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then I saw I got an A, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so I was like, oh, it's not that I'm deaf, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just that I don't listen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It kinda made me realize,
I was like, oh okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm glad to know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't have a hearing problem, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I just have like an attention problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just don't give a shit.
- I just don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's my problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was telling my
company, I was like listen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if my eyesight or my ears come back shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I know exactly why that is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's because I didn't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the fuck was happening
when they were talking to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They just put the headphones on me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, wait what? Wait, whoa. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Then she asked me, luckily
I just caught her asking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> can you hear, in Japanese,
like, can you hear it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, hear what?
What am I listening for? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I realized, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I had done the "Human
Benchmark" test recently, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it was the frequency thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you say when you can hear it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But I was like, what am I
hearing for, like a burp? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know what was happening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, oh okay, shit, all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, how did she... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because with the eyesight thing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You have to do like
the, it's like a circle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's cut out, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How did you guys say that in English? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I said it in Japanese.
- Or did you just point? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (speaking in Japanese) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I really fucked
up in the eyesight thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I didn't know what
they were looking for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I thought it was a
normal eyesight test thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where now it's just like, E, A, because... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, so to explain the eyesight thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have this circle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and have one of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> either up, down, left
or right that's cut out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, the diagonals as well, are cut out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't see diagonals.
- I didn't see diagonals. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was no diagonals. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, there were diagonals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No there wasn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I only saw up, down, left, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, there were diagonals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, 'cause I got all of them right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah I did too, but
there were diagonals, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was no diagonals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was no diagonals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The one they gave me, they
usually have diagonals, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never seen diagonals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because the only reason
I knew about this test </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is 'cause when I exchanged
my driving license </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from British to Japanese, I
had to do the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was this exact same thing again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and there was no diagonals. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I definitely got it right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I came back with like a 1.2. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause you got me like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what the fuck is this man
talking about diagonals? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because right
next to the circle thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you had like the letters as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was just reading out letters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they were asking what direction, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sir, what direction is
missing from this circle? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - O, O, O, O. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I was wondering why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she was looking at me really weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And she kept asking me,
"Can you see, can you see? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> let me just read out the letters for you." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So why are they all
Os? This is easy as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, luckily I'd done
the simulation before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so that's why I was not
panicking as much, but yeah, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I clicked no to the health advice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I just figured </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it was gonna be
the same old, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Eat healthy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause let's be honest, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Unless it's something
bad, like really bad, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that actually requires treatment, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They're just gonna tell me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey, you should exercise
more and eat healthy," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I do most of that anyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because, I think for
cholesterol it's pretty simple. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Unless you just like to eat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But for some of them, like
for example, liver or blood, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you look at that result. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your blood's a little yikes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a number of factors, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, what do you even start with? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do I improve my white
blood cell count? I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do I just take an injection
of white blood cells? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What do you want me to do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have a theory, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This could be a very pleasant
theory, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My theory was, 'cause we
got this health checkup done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right after like Christmas,
and my theory was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well I've just been
drinking and eating straight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like three weeks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is just, clearly
we've gotta write this off, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this doesn't count man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Of course my collateral
is gonna be higher, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had like 8,000 calories three days ago, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of course it's gonna be higher. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sure.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did drink a lot in
Christmas so that might be it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I ate so much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, my cholesterol is terrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I definitely skewed the results, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what I'm gonna chalk it down to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're wrong, science is wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Doctors out there, please
validate me in the comments. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna hear it if you
have an alternative theory, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just say if I'm right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I just found it funny how, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think this is definitely the difference </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> between Asian and Western culture, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I feel like in Asia, living in Asia, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they try to make everything a test, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything kind of competitive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's how I was raised as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so whenever I see a grade
something in my blood drives me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to try and improve that grade. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and I don't know if
I'm just like over-competitive, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or I just, maybe- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well I think it's good, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because if you're the kind
of person who you are, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> those things work really well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But there's obviously some
personalities out there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that when they hear, oh, by
the way, your BMI is bad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or your liver's bad,
where they're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> instead of wanting to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well fuck you, I'm gonna improve it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, oh shit, I guess
it's just like, there's no hope. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like why is it not working? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they just make it worse, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like as someone
who grew up in, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of both cultures, I
think a lot of toxicity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> can come in putting so much
value into a grade or a test. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like definitely living in Asia, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they put way too much
value into test results </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and score results. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you think there are
some schools and companies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where they get bullied if
you got like a bad rating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on one of your health tests? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think, totally, it's
definitely a thing in Asia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look at this mo-fo who
got a D in his blood. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because in Asia, I
dunno if I'm talking out my ass, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but you see in like anime definitely, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you get the test results, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like publicly posted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you publicly know what
your fellow classmates got. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And that to me seems
like a lot of pressure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They do that for university,
like entrance exams as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's fucking rude.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They create a huge billboard
in front of the school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it has like your number on it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and if your number doesn't
show up, you basically failed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like a public execution </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they literally make
a public tournament arc </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for your test results. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's brutal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No wonder they put so
much value on tests here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think that can definitely,
to me, from my experience, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> can definitely skew with your mentality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you go out of schooling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and you realize that not
everything in life is graded, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and not everything in life
has a percentage or a grade </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that judges your results
and how well you do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think especially, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> given the industry that we've gone into, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which is entertainment, if you will, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if you'd call
"Trash Taste" entertainment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but we're trying our best here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like the skill set is nearly 180 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in compares of what you
learn in school, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's purely based on like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like social skills
are 90% of our job, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Being able to read a room,
being able to talk, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, obviously there is
a lot of technical aspects, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously, like learning how
to set up all this equipment, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the majority of it can't
be taught in a classroom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you can't really grade it, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> How can you grade someone's social skills? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Imagine we start doing that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ooh, I mean... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Could you imagine it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, Connor, you were an ass, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but ever since the event happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've been kind of a bummer,
you're kind of a D now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's like getting graded </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for every tweet you make, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, if Japan- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, oh, that was
a B plus tweet right there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, true. Asia is gonna find a way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I went through a period in life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where, you know, I was
the stereotypical wiebe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that didn't go out, and I
have zero social skills. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And how I learned was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think everyone goes through that stage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially if you go through university </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you kind of wanna
reinvent yourself, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You move in to somewhere new
and you wanna be a new person. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So what I did was I basically
just had like a full year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I just went out as much as possible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and talked to as many people as possible, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like try to go
out of my comfort zone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And that was hell for me
as like this introvert, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was kind of like a trial
by fire period of my life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I would never wanna do again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Garnt's "300" spartan
training with social structures. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It basically was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I literally just did
not know how to socialize. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't know how to read a room, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know what the social norms were. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's such a common
cultural thing in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we actually have our
own like phrase for it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is university debut. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's like a
cultural thing in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where because there are
so many anti-social kids </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in middle school and high school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that when they go into university, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like, oh shit,
I'm like one step closer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to where I have to socialize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in order to fucking live in society. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So university is literally my last chance </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before I'm thrown into that world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm gonna like make
a 180 during university </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just fucking do anything
and everything possible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to just completely change myself around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it is a really
Opie mindset, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I wasn't cool at all in school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like very much an
in-betweener, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I wasn't cool, but I wasn't on the bottom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the social ladder, if you will. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You weren't like bullied to shit, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean that's 'cause
I started fighting back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I clawed my way out of the bottom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, I was just
kinda like whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no one really paid attention to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> never had any luck with
dating or anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I never had anything of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then I thought like, Oh wait, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like no one knows who I am in university, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so no one knows I'm a mid tier social, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm a C-tier on the social ladder, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I can reinvent myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I didn't, you know,
I didn't reinvent myself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like you don't do the mistakes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't fall back on
crutches that you had, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you said, right? You go out more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, I could play video games, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which was what I probably
would prefer doing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but if people invite me out, I'll say yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you wanna be seen as fun, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and if you seem as fun
everything goes easier, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you learn more, and you
get more confident, and it's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Go out of your comfort zone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For me it was like
the complete opposite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was really social in middle
school and high school, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then when I entered university, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because I started doing YouTube, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I kind of regressed socially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you also lived at home, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I lived at home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can imagine that's like way... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You must feel, did you feel different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from the other people who were
living on campus and stuff? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, a little bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, our campus was weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I think the majority
of people in my class </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did live at home. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we only had maybe
like a handful of people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who actually lived on campus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which university did you go to again? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sydney University. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so I guess, 'cause
it's a city university. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, we have our own campus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and dormitories and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that uni students live in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But I think the majority of people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's such an
accessible university, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's like smack bang
in the middle of Sydney City, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so people can just get on trains and buses </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just go home basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, cause I feel like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was no one in my class </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who lived locally to the
area, like who was from there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's because you
went to Swanzey, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is there to do in Swanzey? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, that's a good question, Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm still wondering that myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm yet to find the answer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, to be fair. I
didn't live locally either, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I lived like an hour and a half by bus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I didn't live close at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could have, like, I was at a distance </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I could have
easily lived on the dorm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then I heard from people
who were living in dorms </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in Sydney University, they
were like, don't do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you could experience them, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Being thrown into hell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, I feel like I learned more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> valuable social skills,
and just life skills, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> going to university than
I did actual career skills </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I learned from my course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think I
realized it until I left, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I actually
started like functioning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on my own, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know what I would have done </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without that period in my life, Jesus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It basically taught me how
to survive in the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and how people really are, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and all the expectations I had growing up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause as a kid, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You kind of expect that as you grow up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the more mature you get,
you assume that everyone's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just gonna realize what
they're doing, get mature. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you kind of realize, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going through university especially, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that that was a fucking lie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you go out of the university, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> start like the working
world and you realize, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, everyone here is just like
grown up university students </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and nobody actually
knows what they're doing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and everyone is still secretly as immature </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as they were before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like adults aren't as adult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as I thought they were, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I don't know.
I feel like I don't... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's either like people just
have their shit together </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or they don't, like there's no in-between, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never met anyone- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Most adults that I've met </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are just like kids in suits essentially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's basically the
best way I can describe it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And especially seeing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of the recent stuff
that's been happening, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously stuff like, let's say like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can we talk about how- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The stonk market? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can we talk about the stonk market </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we've recently just seen? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we're gonna be
very delayed from you guys- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We are gonna be very
delayed because it's a very- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To us it's just happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To us it's just
happened or is happening, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't fucking know, it's a
constantly evolving situation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So by the time this airs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything we're probably gonna be saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is gonna be outdated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who knows? The stock
market might not even exist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by the time this comes out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My God, when reality
is this entertaining, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who the fuck needs TV? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is what I'm saying,
this is what I've always said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> real life is so much more interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You couldn't make a movie about like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if you would have pitched
a movie being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so what happens is a
bunch of Redditors, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They buy game stock, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they fuck over these
billion dollar head... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone will think that's fucking stupid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but if it happens, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like this is the
coolest fucking story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Thus, documentaries
are better than movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and I just think we
are reaching a time period </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where, you know, it
used to be a funny meme, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but now memes are just... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Real life memes, big memes now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are basically just making fun
of real life events, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And having a real life
effect on the world, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that is what memes are
growing into it now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I saw someone on Twitter saying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they were like, this is
kind of the revitalization </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of it's just a prank bro, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the pranks have actually
gone far, gone wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not gonna lie, the
first time I saw that story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like I don't know
what the fuck is happening, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm really scared to ask. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, when it was happening, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like what the fuck
does shorting a stock mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And now I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> now because of this meme
I've done so much research </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe I should get into
the stock market, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really weird because- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you yoloed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have not yoloed, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are you gonna yolo that
YouTube money away, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look, I'm not a gambling addict, okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> A much as much as the "Gotcha"
episode might've been real, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> look, I am not a gambling addict. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He'll yolo on "Gotcha"
but not on stocks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's made me think a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about my grown up investments,
the grown investments talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that I just never really
thought about before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's weird because
I've been doing stocks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like through like my dad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause my dad is really in business. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I've been doing it but
when this shit happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, should I be
scared? Like what's happening? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't know what was happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dad, is our money safe? Daddy, daddy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Daddy, please, is my money okay? Please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, no one in my family
has had anything about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think every single
generation of my family </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has just like made enough to get by, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and do buy some nice
things here and there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I don't think stocks
was ever on their mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think my parents had some stocks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the companies they
worked for, as like a gift, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I think my dad checks
up on those stocks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But in terms of actually
knowing about the stock market, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, no one in my
family has any idea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, because it's not something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that everyone commonly learns, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's... What I was thinking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's only fancy gambling
for rich men really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what it's like
marketed as, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I mean, I was doing my research </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and properly reading into
this, you know, I was thinking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> why the fuck aren't we
taught this in school? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I feel like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> especially knowledge on the stock market, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of the reasons why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> people don't get into the stock market, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from what I realized, is because
nobody knows shit about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's because nobody was
taught this in school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it sounds so complicated
that nobody has the effort </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or energy to really read
up and learn about this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I didn't, and the only reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I started reading up about this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was because the fucking
stock market was on fire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and it turned into a massive meme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I literally started reading up
about this because of a meme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who would have thought that memes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get you to go into like
educational adventures? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It happens all the time, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But hey, look, what
this made me think was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> why weren't we taught
about this in school? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Growing up, there's so many
life essential knowledge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I think everyone should know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - To be fair though, I'm thinking back, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like when you were like 15, 14, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You wouldn't have paid attention. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You wouldn't have paid attention. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, they always say
like, oh, why didn't they teach </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kids about taxes in school as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because no one- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do think there are however- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because no one would fucking care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think even if you
aren't, even with taxes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do think that there
should have been something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I agree, there
should have been something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There should be something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so at least when you get
to that point in life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you are aware and you
can go back to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, this is why it was important. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because there's so many things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, for example, I don't
know why it's not compulsory </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to have a financial
management course in school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> There should be, there totally should be, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because financial management </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is such an adult life essential skill, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's something that you have to learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> by just either, one, your
parents teaching it to you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or two, fucking up and realizing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that this is an important
skill you need to know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Instead schools are
like, no, let's learn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the quadratic equation,
you will need that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But no, let's learn that there are- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's pretty useful actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're drawing on the quadratic equation, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a very good equation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's learn that there are
180 degrees in a triangle, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've used that before in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's learn about the tangents,
and the cosine and the sine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (indistinct) is the
powerhouse of the sound, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if you know that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, you know, I think why
they should be teaching, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like taxes and financial advice in school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is not so that you get,
'cause obviously kids </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> aren't gonna fucking come out of school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, hello, let me do your taxes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just so that when they leave school, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's on the back of their mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That like, I've been
taught that this is a thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's gonna come up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and that I should learn
how it works for my value. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. The whole point of school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel should be at least preparing you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for what you're gonna
face in the adult world, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and, you know, there can be
some specialized courses. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, I memed it
but I can understand why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they teach mathematics and algebra, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in case you want to pursue that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But what I am saying is there are so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> life essential knowledge that
I had to learn on the fly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and everyone does, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was just not taught
this stuff in school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm thinking, why the fuck
is this not taught in school? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the thing is, is that like, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, people can argue
being like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, who needs to know the
fucking quadratic equation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what people are doing... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like architecture
or like math based stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like financial advice
and taxes and shit like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't matter what job you go into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're gonna have to
deal with it as an adult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, there's so
many things in my school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we were taught that
were replaceable in my mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like we would do like media studies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where we would just analyze
newspapers and shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and just talked about the media, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and how they advertise their stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's in my job now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but I didn't even get
anything useful from that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I had to do that as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I didn't have to do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I did like
cooking which was stupid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause, let's be honest,
I'm not a good cook. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> As I'm sure guys will find out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's be honest, Uber
Eats is a thing now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'ma be honest, make
money, get Uber Eats, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what it's all about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, but, you know, they
could've replaced it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think that, um...
Fuck, what was I gonna say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck, I totally forgot my
point now, fuck. I'm done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Go back to you, I'll figure
out what I wanted to say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I'm just saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like there's so many
important things in life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I just don't know about, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like for example, I have no idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about anything about mortgages
or anything like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and when I say mortgage... You
say the word mortgage, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, oh
okay, you are a grownup. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, as a kid you
hear the word mortgage, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're just like, I don't
need to worry about that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's grown up shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I had to learn
that shit on the fly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I don't know
what the fuck this is about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But the thing is, everyone
should aim to own a house, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or own some property, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like one of the
final goals in life, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And yet nobody's taught
this shit in school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, is it bad the only time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've ever heard the word
mortgage was in a monopoly game? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the only time I've heard of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you know what? I still have no- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still don't know how to
mortgage in a monopoly game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly, I still have like
the bare bones basic idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about mortgage because I've
not gone through the process </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of buying a house, because
that shit sounds scary to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did go and see a mortgage advisor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just 'cause I wanted
to learn more about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and my bank had it for like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they were like free consultations. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had no intention of getting a mortgage, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just wanted to know how they worked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because I feel like
you should know how they work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so I went and then, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just this really awkward thing
of like, so what do you do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, oh well, so I make videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about like anime, this is the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he was like, "Okay,
like, this is your income?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's like, "It changed
a lot in one year." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, yeah, yeah it does that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it could go up or down, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm there thinking
I should just tell him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> as little about my job as possible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> otherwise he's gonna be like,
"This guy is a financial risk, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't give him a mortgage." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, I mean it was
pretty standard stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, there's different rates and stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but you don't need to
fucking worry about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, I had to sit down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with our family financial advisor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like I had to go through- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the most privileged thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've ever said in your life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Holy shit! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I never had a financial advisor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it's because my parents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are super into the housing
market and the stock market </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and shit like that, so it was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're an adult now- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That still sounds privileged. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can talk to this man in a suit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that comes to our house every so often, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you'd think he's our lawyer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I used to call him our lawyer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I didn't know who
the fuck this guy was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, there's a man in
a suit, he must be a lawyer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bro, check your wealth, Joe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This episode is sponsored by Harry's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Quality Grooming and Shaving Supplies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gentlemen, we all have beards, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> except for Garnt who shaved. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I do shave, and
that's why I use Harry's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Man, I just hate it
when I have to choose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> between price and quality,
but thanks to Harry's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's no longer a problem
I have to suffer with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You mean you can get
both at the same time? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes Garnt, you can. </SPEAKER_02>

comfortable shave at a fair price, </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> - Harry's believes in quality so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that they bought their
own factory in Germany. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> Connor, just how do they do it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Garnt, I'm glad you asked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Harry's team combined a
simple ergonomic design </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with five sharp blades, they
sourced their steel from Sweden </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and manufactured their blades </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in their world-class blade factory. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Isn't that a fate arc? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you telling me that
Harry's has min-maxed shaving, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and shaving products? Guys. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> that have mastered the technology

<SPEAKER_04> - This sounds epic, like an anime arc. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But thank God, they also stand behind </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> back to the video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So then when I became an adult </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I started making a little
bit of money on YouTube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like, okay, you
can talk to our 'lawyer' now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who turned out to be a financial advisor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like okay, I don't
know what to do with this money, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> please help me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause otherwise it's just
gonna collect in a bank, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> probably do fucking nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's like, well, you
could, you know, mortgage, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, that word. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh no, that word. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ideally anyone with any kind of savings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would have a financial advisor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sadly, you know, it's kind of
difficult to get a good one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or get one that even... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like understands, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean yeah, I had to fucking like sit- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would if I could, I mean,
I don't fucking know anyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had sit the guy down to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, this is what I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was like, "Wait, so you make videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you get paid to do that?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, yeah, and he's like, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I would love a financial advisor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's so little I know about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this kind of, the
wall street bet thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's been going on has
really just opened my eyes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to how little I know about this stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I feel like I really should know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like a YouTuber I've
been watching recently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is a guy called, I think
it's Graham Spector, I think? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The millionaire guy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the millionaire guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I saw him in other videos
where he was talking about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> he seems like the most
grounded millionaire I've ever- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I couldn't stand him at
first, he seemed like a dick, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I started
watching and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right, okay, he's pretty cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But he just came off as like an ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The biggest thing that me
off is every episode he goes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> he does the, "But don't
forget to like and subscribe, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you like the video", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like, no matter how
cool a person you are, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you say it,
- Immediate turn off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ironically, yeah, immediate turn off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I was watching some of the videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and some of the advice
that he gave, which was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> some of it was just like
really basic financial advice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> about how to manage your money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the thing is, he gives
advice that any person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from any level of income
can take to heart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like one of the ideas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that he really tried to propagate is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no matter how much earn, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone should get this in their mindset, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can invest something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's what I understood as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I had grown up with the mindset </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of like the word, investment,
that's for rich people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's for privileged people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I, I can't invest, I don't
have the money to invest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But even just investing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a fraction of your paycheck or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the long-term can
really help you financially </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and give you a lot of financial stability. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this is the stuff that
we were just never taught. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess as well, 'cause you
hear so many horror stories </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about investments going wrong,
and you also hear about like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, people who
take advantage of people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, a fake financial
advisor who says, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, I'll help you out with your money," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then just runs off with it, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so scary to trust someone
with any amount of money, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and, you know, even if
you have barely anything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's still all you have, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's scary to give that to someone, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and be like, oh, I trust you
to take care of this, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause the way that I was taught up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because, you know, I also didn't come from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the most well-off family. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You didn't have a lawyer
or a financial advisor? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You didn't have a
family financial advisor? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought everyone had one of those. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My parents declared bankruptcy
when I was a teenager. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so I grew up with
a mentality that, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you should try to keep your money as safe, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you should gather up as much as possible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I realized how much
this mentality had affected </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> how I think about just
resources in general. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So what I realized is that
I am that gamer, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I am that gamer who, you know,
whenever you play an RPG- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't use any of the precious- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you get a rare item- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't use it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I don't use it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And whenever I play,
like "Command And Conquer" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something, or some RTS games, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wait until I have a
fuck ton of resources, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I start buying stuff out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I realized, I realized this this week, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when I when I was like,
where did this come from? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I realized, oh, it's
because that's just how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I manage my money, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I've always come in the
mindset of I've gotta save this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just in case of a rainy day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't invest it, I need to save it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because, you know, investing
money might be risky </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so it's better to just save it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And, you know, I kind of realized this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> as I was doing research and
I learned a lot about myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this past week because of a fucking meme. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause a lot of entrepreneurs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are spending everything they have, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just goes right into buying
shit, they have no savings, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just all in the businesses. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well it's all just high
risk, high reward, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but then also as well, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> online there's so much of those fake, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stupid entrepreneurs online
that have just really ruined, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my mind, the image of an entrepreneur, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like a speed run ruin in like five years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I go on like a
Twitter, or a social media, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it has the word entrepreneur on it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my god.
(all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Here's the thing, right?
10 years ago, entrepreneur, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was probably one of the
coolest things you could say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like damn, you're an entrepreneur? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now I just think, oh you're just doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a fucking multi-level
marketing scam to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or you're selling me a course
on how to be more confident. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Have you seen those courses? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Those things are insane, they cost like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like $1,000 for the first course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then they're like, all
right now you've unlocked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the ability to get the
next level of the course, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for only $5,000, and it blows my mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're like trying to teach you shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that can't be learned. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but it blows my mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that people buy into this stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause they're obviously just people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who are spending the
money you're giving them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on this lavish lifestyle, that
then they sell back to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's insane, and I don't know how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people get sucked into this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like when we were talking
about the gambling stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I can understand how somebody
can get into gambling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can gamble away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't understand how someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can watch these entrepreneurs, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> These fake entrepreneurs talk about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> how they can make you loads of money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and they can tell you how to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there's loads like realtors,
have you seen those? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, I could teach you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the best real estate course of your life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just come here for $100 and
then have someone else teach it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then add five more classes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, how does
someone believe this shit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's all fake obviously, I don't get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, someone believes
this shit because there's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think the biggest problem is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's so much information
out there right now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you don't know who to believe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean I can see when someone
knows nothing about... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I know nothing about many things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I also know when someone's
shouting out of their ass, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You have a bullshit detector. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A lot of people don't
have a bullshit detector. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - A $500 paywall right
off the gate for a lesson </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is normally the first indication of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I think to a
lot of people, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they see that paywall and
they see the presentation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they think, oh, well
this is probably legit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean I'm putting money into this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that must mean the advice is legit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If I have to pay this
much for this course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> then it must bring results. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, maybe I just can't see that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause obviously we're doing entertainment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and you see how fake things are, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We've been on the internet
for long enough to know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what's bullshit or not, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also, we're producing content, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know what fake content
looks like, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I can imagine how it was made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and what tactic was used to push that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because whenever
I see one of those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> marketing trailers of like,
oh, you can learn X amount </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and earn X amount. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I swear they all have the
same fucking templates. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - With the same inspiring
stock-like music. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - "The first year I made $3,000, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the next month after
that I made $1 million." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, oh, I'm sure
you did, I'm sure you did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Off mugging everyone off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the equivalent
of going on a piracy site, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then seeing the adverts of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I earned $10,000 from filling out surveys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're like, who the
fuck actually clicks on this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and believes this stuff? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is the con on porn ads, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fact that you're
advertising on like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> not even PornHub, but like
it's some shady hentai website. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Eat this pill and your dick will grow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three times the size in three months. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, now that I'm
thinking about it more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it must come from targeting
insecurities, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Absolutely, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like it must come from like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some people are already insecure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about their financial amount, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm sure there's
other things like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean I just realized now, why
would they offer dick pills? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, because people are pretty insecure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about their dick not working, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's probably the same kind of- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and they don't
know any better, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They just think like, well
I want just the quickest, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> easiest, like most straightforward way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get a lot of money,
oh, look at this ad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a harsh lesson in life to learn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that miracles truly don't exist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who would have thought that you need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to actually put the work and effort into- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If your dick doesn't
work, that might just be, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that might be a lifelong thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think any amount of
pills is gonna save you, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's only so many times
you can pop that Viagra, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you what I mean?
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I feel like it's the same reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why people fall for
multilevel marketing scams. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Apparently that's really bad in the U.S. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have a lot of friends from the U.S </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who tell me that they have
loads of their friends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from high school who tell them that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're constantly messaging about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I don't know how bad it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It could just be that I'm
connected to strange people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who have strange friends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Meilyne, do you have friends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who have multilevel marketing people? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Meilyne] They tried to
sell me alkaline water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Alkaline water.
(all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Tried to sell you alkaline water. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ladies and gentlemen, I have
won case, my proof is there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean yeah, I know a few
people from America as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, maybe not like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Directly, but you know people who know- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I know people, and
even, I think Sydney's mom, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has on occasion messaged Sydney </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about this nice little scheme
that can make her money, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know, Sydney obviously steps in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's because, I mean,
it really preys on people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who are looking for that out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> looking for that out in their life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, when you're
stuck at a dead-end job, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and you are old enough where you feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you're kind of stuck here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're not young enough
to do something crazy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or just quit everything and
you have responsibilities. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, you kind of look for a way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that can get you out of this
lifestyle, whatever that is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And sometimes, I mean, that's why- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, I was gonna say
like, don't get me wrong, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like, you know, in order to
get out of that kind of stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> risk taking is definitely a
thing that you have to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's risk taking and
there's making mistakes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, there's responsible risk taking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you'll always have a
fallback if it doesn't work out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then there's just a risk take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you just yolo it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, at the end of the day, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's be honest, right?
The way life works, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if somebody had a million
dollar idea, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A stranger isn't gonna come
up to you and pitch it to you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're gonna fucking do it themselves. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right? Like if anyone comes up to you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> promising to make you money, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that should be the biggest
red flag in existence. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nobody can promise to make you money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For example- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And if that person also
promising to make you that money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't a billionaire themselves, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why the aren't they doing it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. When I realized where... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What I've realized
growing up is, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my mum and dad would give me advice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about how to be successful in X and Y, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I love my mum and dad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then I came to a
point when I realized that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of the mentality,
especially when managing money, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was not wrong per se, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that's the mentality
that they had to survive, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that's the
environment that they were in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was just different, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it was a different environment, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I gotta realize I'm growing up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> under different circumstances, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I have to, you know,
I have to choose sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever some advice does pertain
to me and when it doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And when someone's
promising you to make money, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like, okay, we're three
successful YouTubers, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But as much advice as we
can give we cannot promise </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a random person to make
them a successful YouTuber. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- [Connor] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We can give advice about
how to increase their chances </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and how to help work the
algorithm, for example. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But we're not gonna drop
a million dollar video idea, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause we would just do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, there's no way that I can sit here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and guarantee you that
yes, I can give you advice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to make you a YouTuber that
gets a million subscribers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Nobody can do that, or
an X amount from YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - As far as I'm concerned, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we were all very lucky in
that case as well, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We had the odds in our favor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But nobody told us what to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I preach by that, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we did a lot of things right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and we all were also very
lucky in a lot of aspects. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There wasn't one without the other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There are things that you can
do to increase your chances </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of success and massively
get the odds into your favor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but to guarantee something, to
guarantee success like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's pretty much impossible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think the sad truth of life is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think you just realize this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like I think the stock market
looks like a fucking casino </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to many people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought it was a casino. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of the hedge funds
do treat it like such. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But at the end of the day- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We learned that today, we
learned that in the past week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - At end of the day it's truly
a sad moment when you realize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there isn't really a get
rich quick scheme in life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't exist, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And if you're looking for that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like you're already
setting yourself up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to be disappointed, or
gonna hurt yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - If there was a scheme
that could 100% give you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a success rate of like,
you're gonna get famous, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you wouldn't think everybody
would be doing that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it might make someone rich, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably not gonna be you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Here's the thing, like
reading up about a lot of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> financial advice and everything
that I have for the past </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, the past week, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, take this with an exact- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Three people who don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the fuck they're
talking about financial, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> discuss financial advice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Please do not take any of our advice, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this is not financial advice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We do have to make a
disclaimer about this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but from what I've read
and from what I've seen, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it seems like you can
definitely increase your chances </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of being successful in life,
but the problem is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of the legitimate advice I've seen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it seems to stem from
you don't get rich quick, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's all boring stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's all put your money in safe places. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the long game most of the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait 10 to 20 years and
you'll be well off in life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Nobody wants to hear that advice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's just boring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's just boring </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They wanna hear the,
I went to sleep, woke up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I have a million dollars now right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't wanna hear about Roth IRA's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or put your money in fucking cash Isis. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want Gamestop stocks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. They wanna
hear something exciting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but when you hear boring financial advice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just kind of tune out
and you're like, oh, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I can get rich but just not now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but like in 10, 2O, no,
more like when I retire, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna have a retirement fund. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And thus Garnt figured
out why all the old people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> hold all the wealth in nearly
every developed country. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I noticed, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just looking around for maybe like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanted to just talk
to a financial advisor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not like do anything, I
just wanted to talk to them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and just have like the free consultations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and talk to them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and just figure out what the
fuck, like what do they do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what can they do, what's a
good one, what's a bad one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I noticed on all of the websites, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at least in the UK,
every single one, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was picture of some young
man helping an old person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out on a laptop, pointing at the monitor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it was all- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a Stock image. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was all just
like pension advice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pension, pension, pension,
and like long-term, long-term. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like none of it was like risky- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For young people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, none of it was for young people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause, you know, let's be honest, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> young people don't do that shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no. So yeah, it was really, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you kind of just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of the things that
you'd noticed about the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> start to fall in place,
and when you start looking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like, ah, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything's starting to make sense now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like my best advice to
anyone young watching this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is if this conversation leads to anything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just go out and do your research. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Actually read up about this shit, because- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't fucking sign up to a $500 seminar, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I will disown you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't do that, just read up
about basic financial advice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everything you need to know is free. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's the thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> everything you need to know is free </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the only thing stopping
you is your own laziness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause that is.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Me reading up about this
felt like I had just gained </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> five levels of info
that I should have known </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when I was in my 20s. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, why didn't
I know this shit before? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was stupid, I was lazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't expect to get rich off
the GameStop stonks and shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like the road is gonna be long
and probably really boring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm investing in learning Japanese, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so that I can become a
translator for a yakuza </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I'll translate the wrong number </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like in the "Great Pretender", </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and profit hundreds of
millions of dollars for myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Thus being the best investment of ever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, someone's gonna take that idea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't fucking steal
my get rich quick idea, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I swear to God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You gave away the million dollar idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bi-lingual people
don't do it, all right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just like writing it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Joey's like shit, write that down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Joey's called up his financial advisor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna set this scheme,
you won't believe it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does anyone know any yakuza? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Any yakuza with cross
country gang information </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that we could- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Does any yakuza need any
translation work? I'm your man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, well boys, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I have something very
special planned today. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They said it wouldn't happen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the common said it couldn't
be done, but I finally did it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I wrote a PowerPoint presentation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for all the different ways- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You actually did it?
You actually did it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How many weeks ago was that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was just like at week 10 or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like nine or something, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, when you say
something off hand and then- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was an offhand comment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was an offhand comment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then the community and the Reddit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were just like never let you forget </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you said that one thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To explain what Garnt is talking about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know which episode it was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Play the flashback mode on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What I gotta do is
I gotta, some episode, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I need to bring a presentation
of all the different ways </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people have tried to hit on me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I gotta,
- Please. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A PowerPoint presentation, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the most interesting ways it's happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So I made a little presentation,
with some fun images </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to explain all the different
ways that you can be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so I guess I should pull the laptop up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you about to break down the 93%? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Break down the 93%,
it's not the 93% anymore, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a 59%. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is how you can also be the 93%. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sign up, first month is $100. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanna preface that
this is not my laptop, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as it has stickers on it,
so it's just disgusting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, that's my beautiful laptop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "A YouTuber Guide To Being Hit On, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the ways a YouTuber can be hit on." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow, this is bringing me
back to like high school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, you've actually done
a PowerPoint presentation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is this is a Ted talk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is my Ted talk,
Ted didn't invite me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I thought, we'll make my own. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Before we start, how much
effort did you put into this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not that much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So this is like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, so basically these
are all true things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that have happened at
one point or another. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I didn't write the whole details out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so basically they're more
prompts for my memory </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to be like, ah yeah,
this is what happened, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right, let me explain it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This looks like a real Ted talk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess so, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This isn't like the high school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm reading off the PowerPoint. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, there's literally like two sentences </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just to remind me, oh,
it's this story, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, I do wanna
preface before we begin, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not trying to make
out that I'm some kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like fucking sex God
that no one can resist, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's literally just when you
have X amount of subscribers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously there's gonna
be two people out there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that are stupid enough to
think that I'm attractive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and try and hit on me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just wanna get that out there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're being very humble there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do no think that I am
like X hot or whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it just happens with the job, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> People don't try it with you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause, you know, you guys are
basically married, all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not to each other, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why are you laughing, Meilyne? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Meilyne's like, I love the gay talk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - She's like, tell me more
about how they're married. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you expect to see on this list? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> What are you excited for? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Uh, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Basically, I'm just looking
forward to this presentation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just being a massive excuse
to say I'm not a fuck boy but. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I obviously didn't reciprocate, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause most of these are strange. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've also accompanied, I just downloaded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a bunch of stock images, I
didn't pay for the license, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I shouldn't say that, but I
just downloaded the bunch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you, Getty Images,
for sponsoring this episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So just to accompany
it, just for fun, why not? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I said, I love Stock Images. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we have the classic to
start with, what is that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So this is, as I've said, a
text to my personal number. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, what? How did they
get your personal number? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what I wanna
know, Garnt. I don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So this happened about, I
think four or five months </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into my YouTube career, if you will. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought great, I
haven't leaked anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just do live streams-
- That was what, 2015? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I was wondering how
the fuck someone had done this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So turned out, at the time I had an iPhone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the email that I listed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was actually like my email
linked to my iPhone account, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and someone had just
connected the dots of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, let's just put this email
on my iPhone and text Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't use iPhone anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that's how, because
they did the iMessage thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, so I deleted that email, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so it doesn't exist anymore,
'cause I was like, fuck this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But at the time it was very
creepy of wake up to a text </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from an American number being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hi, is this Connor by the way?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not exactly being hit on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but I stopped it before
it could get there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the first one, I
think this is a Stock Image. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] I've actually had
something similar happen to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Admire my Stock image. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] I have a lot of
questions about this Stock image. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Why is there a potato there? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] What is that stock image? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] I don't know, these
are all strange Stock images. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So she's just saying no
to the potato on the desk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, I've had
similar things happen to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not gonna name what messaging app </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or whatever it was on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but I've realized that you
could find my username, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously pretty easily
through this messaging app. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I would get like people adding me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and just messaging me randomly on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That was a humbling experience to realize, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, okay, I can't-
- I fucked up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I fucked up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't use this email for everything now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] All right,
the classy, the fan mail. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The actual handwritten letter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, like a physical fan mail. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was this sent to your P.O box? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This was sent to my P.O box, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was about to ask how
they found your address. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - P.O box, you know, had a few letters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that were asking if I was, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they would know what
conventions I'm going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they would say,
"Hey, is it possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that maybe we could go
on a date or something?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And obviously, you know- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never got that,
even when I was single. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No?
- Never. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe with time it'll change, Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - YouTubers weren't cool
back then, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is just like two, three years ago, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this used to happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It didn't happen that often, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but people would attach their
numbers and then they would- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never had that,
did you ever have that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, when I first
started up really blowing up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on the anime community </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was already pretty much dating Sydney. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And, you know, if like Sydney makes her, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's say she marks her territory. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - She wards off the- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The laser eyes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The predators, also I added
a stock image, it's this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] What is happening? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] It's a guy with a beer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] This man's doing
like a parallel park drift </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> while pouring a beer, I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] The classy.
- [Joey] On a highway? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] And then this one
is the modern, the fan email. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Obviously, we get emails. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, we still get that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] It's a classic,
we get that all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] That was a classic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] And then
this is the Stock Image, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause this is me putting
the emails in the trash </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> when you send them to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought you meant
this is all the fan mails </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we get for "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all exclaiming) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I hate you, Joey,
it's not fucking funny, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - All pretty standard so
far for YouTubers though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Okay, next we
have the extra classy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I used to do Patreon fan letters, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where you could pay to
be pen pals with me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, that sounds like so much effort. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That doesn't sound like a
nightmare is about to happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I made that I
didn't think it was gonna, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's not on there anymore, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I used to think that it was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, this is such a cool
way to connect with me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I didn't realize about the logistics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause you never do with Patreon, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you never think about the
logistics until you realize- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have do this every month. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, basically I agreed to
write like 20 letters a month </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I'm not good at writing either, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I don't like writing,
so writing one letter for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> takes like 30 minutes, cause I hate it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've seen your handwriting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I hate writing so much
so it was just painful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was really frustrating as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll go on to how I got hit on after. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it was frustrating as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause people would join
Patreon for one month and leave. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I would send out a letter
that would just be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tell me about yourself,"
and then not get a response. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I'd have to write like
seven of those letters a month, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> every month, and I was
doing them all by hand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How long was the letter itself? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a page or two? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jesus.
- Geez, that's a long- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - For how much a month? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it was on like the $40 tier, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but that was included with
a voice message as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So like how much would,
let's let's break this down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on cost to effort-wise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> How much would it take you
to write a letter? Not long? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I guess if they paid $40 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for 30 minutes worth of work, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'd always get distracted
and I couldn't focus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I just didn't wanna
be doing it, so it was awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, I had someone as
well, same with the fan letter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was this really weird situation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm not really sure what happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I was just being
like, ah, yeah, cool, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I like Pokemon too, I like these things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I was trying and be honest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and trying to make a friendship with them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they were like, they
replied one time being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh yeah, so I told my coworkers at work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I have a boyfriend and
I said that it was you." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And then they asked like, "Is that okay?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, sure, I don't give a fuck, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not gonna go around
saying that, you can say that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - She brings up the Cdawgva to YouTubers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and she's like, "Hey, you
wanna see my boyfriend?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's my boy right there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look at that guy, Sebastian,
his name's Sebastian. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just thinking and
I'm like, is that a brag? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because if they pull up my videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> half of them are either
gonna be me reading BL, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or me in the cosplay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think they were from
like Midwest somewhere, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> super conservative state, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so I couldn't imagine
they would take too kindly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to me being like naked in
my room, basically going, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (squeals)
you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So yeah, that was
interesting, that was fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also, it's a boyfriend
that never fucking responds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to messages or anything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a one way boyfriend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a boyfriend that
replies once a month via mail. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, I ended up getting rid of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because, just stuff like that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That sounds like effort. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And also it's just way too much effort. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And this is the Stock
Image to accompany it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] What is happening? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] This is me
writing the reply email </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the hitman that they
hired if I didn't say yes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we were dating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then yeah, this is the obvious, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is called nutting during fan calls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I made a video about this,
you should go and watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's really old now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know the
story, but you can tell. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So essentially there was this time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I was doing a fan
call as Hetalia characters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That sounds like cringe
already, all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I was doing it with someone else </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who was doing another voice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and we were on the call with the person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I thought like there's
some weird breathing sounds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coming from them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I was like, huh, it
sounds a little weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I didn't think much of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it Meyline? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Too bad, you bring the Dakimakura </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or someone from like "Vampire
Knight" she'll get like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So what happened was, is
that we were on this call, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought, that's weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then when we got off the call, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it was only like six, seven minutes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Bruce, was that weird? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That call was weird, right?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And he was like, "Oh
no, I don't think so." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I was editing the audio, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I can go back and listen to the audio, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, she's definitely nutting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that isn't like hyperventilating breath, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like slow, deep breaths. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (breathing heavily) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like that, and I was like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I made a video about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I pitch shifted and changed it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and it sounds even creepier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It sounds like a two year
old now, which is just scary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I wanted to protect
their identity obviously, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I don't know if it was,
I don't know if it wasn't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like, it don't sound good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, I had cut a lot of people- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a bit of yikes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's a bit of yikes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do you handle that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're playing character, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you do those calls
you're in character, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so when people would say stuff
I would reply in character, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like to reject them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd just like to imagine,
you just hear like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (moaning) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And Connor's like pastor, oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which "Hetalia"
character were you playing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was playing France from "Hetalia". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never watched
"Hetalia", but I assumed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> he was like a bit of a player
from what I understood. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would have loved it if
he was playing like Italy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (moaning) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah, pastor, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I was playing France,
they were playing Italy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They were playing Italy.
(chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pastor.
(Joey moaning) </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sorry.

<SPEAKER_04> - I'm a fake Konosuba fan.
- Fake fan. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Woo! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like, to be fair, it
would happen fairly often </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I nearly always cut them
'cause it was just cringe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And people would just be
like, I wanna date Sebastian, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'd be like, no one is
worthy of me, like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when I'm in the zone
and I would do these calls, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I would like fully believe in that moment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that I was like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause you have to if
you want to do it good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, you're playing
a character, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so when people
would say stuff like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would just like snarkily
just insult them straight away, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they loved it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it was fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Dude, imagine being an asshole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and everyone's like, oh
my God, he's amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How long did you do this for? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - These calls?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did them for like two, three years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How? Just how? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, 'cause when it went
well it was really fun, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because people had such a genuine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happy response, really great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You had to just deal with
some weird shit fairy often. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I was like, all
right, I'ma head out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this Stock Image,
from that call, am I right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm only joking Meilyne, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you were probably never that bad, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, she was. She still is, she is worse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm joking.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've seen her when she
gets around Uta No Prince. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All right, next is the uncomfortable, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as if none of them were already. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] The last one
wasn't uncomfortable? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I can deal with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause that's in
character, that's not Connor, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's Sebastian, that's France. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's not my problem,
that's France's problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - She's getting real hot for France. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So yeah, up until very recently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I used to do Patreon fan calls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was not in character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, as me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I would offer, and
it's gonna sound like a lot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like $100 an hour
to have a call with me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but then if you ask any
YouTubers around our sides, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll be like, wow, that's too little. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause, I know, it sounds
absurd, it sounds stupid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my parents all thought it was dumb. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "People pay to speak to
you, Connor? That's absurd." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - My parents got the same reaction. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Why would anyone wanna
pay speak to you, Connor?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, mom, fuck off mom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So anyway, up until recently I
used to do Patreon fan calls, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I said. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd call it like generations,
I don't really know why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but people would always leave
in mass and join in mass, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's only 10 spots on my call, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so only 10 people at a
time could get these calls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I would only maybe
have like one person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who was on it for like two plus years, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but the rest of the time it
was like rotating people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And like I had some really
fucking uncomfortable ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that I haven't really spoke about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm just like,
this is so fucking weird, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but I mean, I might as
well speak about it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So this one time, this is by
far the most uncomfortable, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where I had done two calls with the person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were like, okay, all right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they seemed pretty decent,
seemed pretty normal, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were from Vegas,
you know? Aki represent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I don't know why
you're pointing at me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not from Vegas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, and they were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sorry, I didn't do webcam,
it was only about voice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But one time they were
like, "Can we do webcam?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, all right,
sure. I mean, a one-off, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like what's the worst that
could happen with a webcam? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You guys know what happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I'm like okay,
sure. Sure, let's do it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> let's do webcam, whatever, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you've been on Patreon for
a while, we can do this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we boot up the call,
I turn on my webcam, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she turns on her webcam. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Ah, yeah, she's naked. She's fully naked, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but wearing body paint, but you can like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The look on Usher's face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Luckily she was over
age, dodged a bullet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Thank God.
- Luckily. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Luckily, thank God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Otherwise finna get
arrested immediately, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, yo, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I was like, oh no,
the connection's breaking up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You go like, hello can you hear me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (imitating static) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, gosh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hello, I'm going through a tunnel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally the moment it happened, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like it flashed on the screen, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, smash the red
and fucking end this call. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, fuck man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know how hard, British internet man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it keeps going out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm so mad at them man, ugh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I gotta stay on voice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my internet can't handle the webcam. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Damn, my webcam just imploded. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like fuck, that's
awful, it's just terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I had some other
uncomfortable things come up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and generally just not
very good things happen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that were just like,
why are they doing this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, they would just hit on you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in really uncomfortable ways, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the point where I
was just like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> some people would think that, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd meet some people who had
clearly never been rejected </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in their circle, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they pay me to talk to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they're like, well
I've never been rejected, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's not gonna start now obviously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They think I'm gonna like...
This is a work thing for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm there doing business. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sounds like you had
a fucking babe station, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> call center going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously, 'cause like, it's great, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 90% of people, it was chill,
it was just talking to them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> give them a bit of useful advice, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and maybe help them with
things, super normal calls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like some people
were like, bro, this is my in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is my way to get Connor
to hang out with me or stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and like all sorts of weird shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like people would go around and, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like, I think recently, I used
to do like voice recordings, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I still do to be fair,
'cause they're really easy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But people would go around,
take the voice recordings </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and say, "Look, me and
Connor are best friends." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ugh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, I have a message
from Connor saying hi to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we're kind of like best friends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, do people know?
Like why do people do this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why? Do you think you're getting clout? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you comfortable with that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wouldn't be comfortable with that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know that to me is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Someone going around saying
that they're a friend of mine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to get their way is not cool with me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's also, you
know, it's big brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause, you know, I could be like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's say, right? God forbid, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I say something stupid on a live stream, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we're like, no, that's just a recording, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a Patreon recording not me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck was that? No, I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well now when Connor
gets counseling, two year- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I get counseling
I'll be like guys no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was a script, I was doing a job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just watch this one clip at least. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was playing France from
"Hetalia" the whole time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never record anything inappropriate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just like, obviously,
'cause some people want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an uplifting message </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they've been beaten down recently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm more than happy to do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I'm like, you know, if
me giving you a voice message </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saying, hey man, things will
get better, just keep trying- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I've done that before as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but at the same time, if I
found out that that person was- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh I don't give them
voice messages anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, was going around
telling people, hey- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm best friends with Giggukaz </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm best friends with Garnt, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, okay, get
the fuck out of my life please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I email them basically saying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> hey, I'm removing you from Patreon, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what the fuck are you doing? This is sad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, of course. That's not cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because the worst thing was that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she wasn't going around
to like her close friends, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for some reason she was going around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and sending them to other YouTubers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> saying I'm friends with Connor,
look, I have this message, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and unfortunately some of
those YouTubers didn't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that I was doing the
Patreon voice messages. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I mean, I've gone
through that as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where I've had people going
around saying that they know me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and saying that they
have been friends with me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when they weren't just to try
and get in with other people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, that's the
biggest fucking red flag for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's kind of
one of the big reasons, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well as time, is why
I removed the ability </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to call me on Patreon,
I don't do it anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't have a quick phone call with me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the worst
thing that happened to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was it literally happened
to me at a convention, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where, you know, I had a
guy who was going around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> telling people, telling
companies, that they knew me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were trying to use that as an in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's somehow even worse, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is when they're going around to companies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause they're potentially
ruining your name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But they're also trying
to profit themselves, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes, you see I can deal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with someone being a fucking
creep, that's (indistinct), </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I can just immediately
shut that down, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But if someone does that,
that's repairing I have to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's horrible. Luckily, that's why- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess that's why
it triggers me so much, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I hear that and I just think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dude, the shit I had to deal with then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The audacity of this bitch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would gladly have someone
hit on me on a call 100 times, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rather than them go to a company
saying that we're friends, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I can, you know? That's fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude, do not do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That is the biggest
asshole move you could do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] We have Garnt
in 50 years, as the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] It's (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Okay, I don't
know what the Stock Image is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Where the fuck
did you get this image from? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is this? Is this
like Asian Humpty Dumpty? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You type in (indistinct),
and this what comes up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So this is, the real. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was at a coffee shop one
time, in good old Swanzey, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'd recently just broke
up with my ex-girlfriend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was very sad and so my
housemates took me out for coffee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And we were just like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he just wanted to talk to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just keep me uplifted, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I love coffee, I love talking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so this is the perfect combination. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And whilst I was at the coffee shop, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> dressed in like sweat pants,
miserable, some person, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what looked to be like a 15
year old girl, I shit you not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by the way, I was like 20, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> comes up to me and I know
they're coming to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know how I know?
- [Garnt] How? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They got a fucking, they
have like the scout leader, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> scout regiment backpack
from "Attack On Titan". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I saw them looking at me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I could see this eye
contact not breaking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> coming up to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And no joke, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> She was like, can I sit down
and join you for coffee? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she's like 15, and her
friend is like right there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, what is happening? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's kinda inappropriate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, I don't really know you,
I don't really wanna do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean it's not really being
hit on 'cause underage, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah, it was just
kind of uncomfortable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just like what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought like a picture, sure, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm totally fine with doing pictures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or signing anything you want,
I don't care about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But like you wanna just sit down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and start talking next to me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, don't invite yourself
to like, that kind of thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't know, it's weird, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but they were a kid, they
didn't know any better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, that's
happened to us a few times, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's happened at
conventions quite a bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it happens at conventions- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Conventions, I expect it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but when you're hanging
outside, just chilling, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was pretty beat up at
the time and I was really hurt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you weren't in
the best mental state. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was really fucking sad, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and having a girl come up
to me, just being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hey, can I sit next to you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, I really
don't want to right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't wanna do anything
with any women anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was literally like
the day off as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I was like fuck it, I was miserable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause I think about that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I think, you know,
she'll probably look back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> at that period of her life- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cringe.
- And just fucking cringe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I can, we're not
saying you should do it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or I'm justifying it or anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because you shouldn't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But I know that, you know,
when you're that young </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you feel like you have
a para-social relationship, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't know about this stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Especially, you don't know
about the social boundaries, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and she'll probably grow up
and she'll look back at that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she'll wake up in a cold sweat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And think, God, why
the fuck did I do that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally you can approach me anywhere, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if it's in a fucking toilet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really give a shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as long as I'm not pissing,
or I'm eating or drinking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, please don't
do it when I'm pissing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - While I'm pissing and
eating, just please don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I just wanna finish my meal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's what I look forward
to most in the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the few times where
we can have full privacy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so just give us that privacy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not even that, I
just wanna enjoy my meal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just love food so much, I
don't wanna have to think about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh fuck, I have to take a
picture, my steak's going cold. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and this is the stock
image to go along with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Quiet at a coffee shop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know how I told the
story about the dude </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who stopped me in the urinal, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is the exact face
he made when he saw me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> He was like, "Yo, it's
Joey!" I'm like dude- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like Joe, that's your dick? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, dude, my dick's out man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like don't pog at me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my dick's out right now man, let's stop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - He literally pog jumped your dick? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've mentioned the next story before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah, this is the hotel key card one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when someone gave me their hotel key card. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, that
shit was fucking creepy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] This is the
Stock Image that I chose </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to go along with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you know actually,
this is the same trio- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that Ludwig? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tell me that doesn't look like Ludwig? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is the girlfriend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is the girlfriend meme, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is the girlfriend meme, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the guy looking the other way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I recognize the guy's face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the exact same
model, from the girlfriend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So yeah, to those who don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and don't wanna go back
and watch the episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> essentially what happened
was someone gave me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a piece of paper and they
were like, this is for you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and on it was their hotel
key card and room number, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was signed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it said uh, there was
like times when I could go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause there was a person
at the desk next to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who was helping, you know, manage, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause when you get the money,
you had to (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they were like, "Bro," and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Do you want it? I don't want it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Needless to say, I immediately gave it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to the hotel reception when
I was done signing things, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were like,
"Why do you have this?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, it's a long story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this one's called, the
bold, it's a hotel door, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> with a hotel door. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I told you one story about
how there was one hotel room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where I was on the bottom floor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we came out and there was
the two girls, at midnight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But there was another
time where I came back, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this wasn't as creepy,
it was just kind of weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like middle of
the day, like 1:00 PM. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was this at an anime convention? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This was at an anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of course it was an anime convention. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where else would it be, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I don't know how someone
found out it was my room, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was pretty careful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I made sure, it
sounds so fucking stupid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like made sure no one
was following me, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> As Garnt should have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is why I do it even
though it sounds like I'm CIA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wouldn't have got it,
I wouldn't have understood </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until I got followed back to my room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I just don't want
people to know, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And there was just like, for some reason, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one girl who looked like
in her 30s, just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know how the doorframe is like this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just sitting like this at my doorframe, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like blocking the door. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, like the door is here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, so that's the frame, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And this is the other frame. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So they're just there
right in front of your door. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and I was like, hello? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And they were like, "Oh,
I like your videos." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, oh no. I'm
like social skills 10,000, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, oh, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Then I was like , "Oh okay,
awesome. You want a picture?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they were like, "Yeah
sure, that'd be awesome." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And we took a picture,
and then they just left, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, cool, I
don't have to say anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I didn't know what was going on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, why are you in
front of my hotel room door? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're on like the fifth floor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like nowhere near
the elevator or anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this is really far away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think maybe they wanted, I
don't know if they knew me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously they did, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but my first thought was like,
are they just chilling here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I get it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause sometimes the lobby
is really crowded and shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you wanna just go to
the alleyway or whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in the fucking rooms, 'cause they're long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just like, oh, how did
you know this was my door? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's pretty concerning,
I wanted to ask her. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never found out, so
to this day I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why she was in front of my door, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what she wanted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Again, this isn't a very
good guys getting hit on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is just strange
ways people approach me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, this sounds like
a lot of strange things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that have happened about
you getting stalked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just gonna say it's, hit on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're gonna put it all under
the umbrella, it sounds catchy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is the YouTube clickbait, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're gonna stay hit
on in the description. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, this is actually
YouTube clickbait. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, this is true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then this is the Stock image </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I found for this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Although there is that one story- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] R.I.P to all
the audio only listeners. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This does make me
realize about the person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> who isn't on the list, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but the person who named
their baby after me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Have we told that story? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah.
- We haven't told that story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So back when I was re-doing
"Black Butler" a lot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there was this one person
who, obviously this was it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's how I remember, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just remembered the
canonical in my head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I went to the "Black
Butler" meetup one time- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The canonical order. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The canonical order of the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is head canon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - They say in the filler arc. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what happened was, this
was like my first ever AIX, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I can't remember how
long I was doing YouTube for, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I thought it would be cool just to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the "Black Butler" meetup
and just say hi, hey man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm the guy on YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who does all the "Black
Butler" stuff, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And just say hi and just, you
know, it was just to meet them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just meet all the fans of
"Black Butler" and to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, this is fucking sick,
and they're all really nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And there's one person who
was like really, really nice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> super, super nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And yeah, she was really nice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we got loads of pictures
with her, a little intense, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's fine, I'm used to that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean all "Black Butler"
fans are quite intense, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be fair. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but some of them are just there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> don't give a shit about
watching my videos, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but there was a good... I'd
say like half there were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my God, yo, excuse me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause you were the "Black Butler" guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> back then, weren't you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean yeah, in terms of
YouTube I was the only one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> making content about "Black Butler". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause it was like how many years after </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Black Butler" had aired? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I feel like I almost
made like a mini renaissance </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the (indistinct), in terms of Western. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause the community
became way more active- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's kinda like what
the "Abridged" series, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> did for the "Yu-Gi-Oh"
anime back in the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I don't wanna
say it was that heavy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but I feel like it was definitely a bump </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because of all the "Black
Butler" stuff I was pumping out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But anyway, a year goes by, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I go to the, you
know, they're messaging me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> telling me you have to come back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to the "Black Butler" meet up again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I have a big surprise for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I'm like, all right, okay, sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought it was like a gift or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they were making out to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was like, okay, sure, I'll
get it, I'll take a picture, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll come, why not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the point where I was trying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to distance myself from "Black Butler", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was like, okay, cool, I'll come. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I go, lo and behold
she's holding a baby, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> literally, like a two month old baby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how old this baby
is, like it's a fresh baby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fresh baby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fresh out the oven. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Freshly made baby. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not a single wrinkle on this baby. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she's like, "Do
you wanna hold Connor?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Connor? That's
a funny coincidence." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she said, "Oh no, no,
it's not a coincidence, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I named him after you." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, okay, this is fucking weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is fucking weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The fuck? My favorite ever photo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is of you holding baby Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's still out there? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - With the most uncomfortable smile </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've ever seen on you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How'd you even react to that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Uh, just pure confusion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And again, you gotta understand Garnt, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just go with everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - His face holding the baby is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, yeah, I get it. I
would do exactly the same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanted the picture to
reflect how uncomfortable I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I could tell the story later on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, there's a picture out there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you just Google,
Connor with baby, maybe? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Connor with baby? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cdawg baby I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Well I don't know what the fuck comes up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's CDawgVA two. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and to be fair,
it's pretty fucking cute, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but like there was something
wholly uncomfortable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about holding a stranger's baby </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that I just, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like holding someone's
expensive vase, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still don't know how to handle babies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like someone asks me if
I wanna hold their baby, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, does it come
with an instruction manual? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What do I do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel so inadequate when
it comes to handling babies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're great for the 10 seconds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where they're not like crying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then the moment you pick
them up and they start crying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, Oh God, Oh God, what to do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like stop please,
please, stop, stop! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but as odd as that is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and almost creepy, you could say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's flattering more
than anything, I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were very nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's probably flattering in a sense but- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's flattering, I
just, I would feel that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if anyone named a baby after me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a bit too pressure on me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like naming your
baby after any influencer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is a bad idea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you find it Meilyne? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Meilyne] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What did you type in? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Meilyne] Cdawg baby. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Type in Cdawg baby. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, Meilyne found it
by typing in, CDawg baby. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Apparently it comes up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just think it's a bad idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> naming your baby after any influencer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We all know we're just one
bad tool away from being- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, don't name your kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after your favorite
YouTuber, that's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like getting a tattoo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of your favorite YouTuber, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But luckily it was just
Connor and not CDawgVA the bay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I have no idea
how Corp's husband feels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when he sees his voice,
what do we call it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's his wave file. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the wave form of
him breathing as a tattoo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, man, how'd you handle that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yikers.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So that's how that happened. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that is very bold indeed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is very bold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've got like the next one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's called, the smooth paper. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been handed pieces of the
paper before at conventions, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, I always like sign something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or I'll take a picture and
I'll charm in a piece of paper. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll be like, "Hey, here's
my number? Come text me." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's kind of
smooth, that's very old style, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why that's smooth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I never reply to any of
them, 'cause I'm like, bro, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my phone doesn't work in the U.S, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sorry, I just have internet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's very smooth, I like it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually like that
one, I think it's classy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Now, you're gonna get
this at every convention. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, shit. Fuck, I shouldn't have said. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause with this one, it's not intense, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, if I wanna
call you, I'll call you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not gonna call you,
just letting you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I'm too fucking busy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just the casual, right?
That's how I imagine people- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's nice.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's something simple
about it that's so inoffensive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But maybe it's because I'm a guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like if I was a girl
and guys kept doing it to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd be annoyed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that'd be very creepy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is very flattering
when someone is attractive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and they send you, you
know, they hit on you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, oh wow, this league? Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Ah, no, get out of here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We weren't even playing the same sport. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought I was playing checkers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're playing 40 chairs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This don't match. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah, I mean, it's a nice
ego boost for like 20 minutes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until you realize that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Until you realize it's a bit weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Until you realize, fuck, this
is a bit strange, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Golden rule, don't fuck your fans, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Especially in this climate, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I just think that's a
great rule to stick by. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, dude. Whenever I used to... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause for the first like
two or three months in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had like Tinder, 'cause I thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no one's gonna recognize
me on Tinder, fantastic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yet there's people who
recognized me on Tinder here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who could speak English obviously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and obviously a white guy would stand out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they were like, oh,
I watch your videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, immediately unmatch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You played it smart. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why would I wanna... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to date someone
who turns up and they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yo, I love that video you just posted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because unfortunately
there's a lot of YouTubers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who'd probably use that
as an ego boost, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Listen, okay, getting in the whole topic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of fucking your fans, or dating your fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There is a way to go about it that works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There is a right way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there is definitely a wrong way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dunky and Leah, they
met through being fans, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and no one ever would
question, what's the word? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Legitimacy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The legitimacy or the
ethicacy of that, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a legitimate relationship. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But there are ways to doing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are like taking
advantage of your power, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I think that's where
people have the problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And unfortunately, a lot of
YouTubers don't understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when they are kind of taking
advantage of their own power </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the situation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I feel like hooking up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I say hooking up, hooking
up is the wrong word. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because if hooking up
with your fans implies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that yeah, you are just kind of just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're not pursuing
anything afterwards, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're just kinda
throwing your fame out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like you have
to be really self-conscious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about this, and I'm glad that people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> are looking more into this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and putting more attention into this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fans are getting
smarter about it as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and fans are getting
smarter about this as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> as they really should be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's the responsibility
you hold as a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and sometimes you just don't
wanna worry about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You just wanna meet someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you don't wanna have to worry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about this power imbalance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because we all are just people as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're all just people and sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we just wanna switch off
this part of our lives, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just be a normal fucking
person like anyone else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't want someone
who watches my videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and has an expectation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of me in general, that
I couldn't live up to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is portrayed through your video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's funny 'cause most
of the friends I've made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who started off as fans,
as we became friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they just started watching
less and less of my stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's because... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In a lot of ways that
made me more comfortable, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or we stopped talking about it
because they were just mates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and we would talk like mates, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and talk about whatever
else apart from my job, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as I'm sure they stopped- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I kinda feel that works in the same way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like friends between
two YouTubers, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, I definitely watched less </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of my YouTuber friends
videos after we just kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> went past that point
and just became friends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, you keep up with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just to see what your mates are doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but you're not like damn bro, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that last video, fucking banger bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I would've done
this differently though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I like showing support
to my mates, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's different from being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yo I'm a huge fan of
what you did, fuck yes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking banger right there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, man, life's hard hey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> If you're a YouTuber, if
you wanna just be safe, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't fuck your fans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Rule number one, don't fuck your fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I've been doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's been working good for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't fuck your fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Here's my Stock Image. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Can you explain why you chose </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this particular image? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Okay, so there is a Labrador </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> holding a gun right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just thought this one was fun, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Okay, sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] I don't know,
it's kind of fun, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is what happens when you reach </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like the end of your project </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll just throw whatever shit I put on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, we're about halfway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're about halfway? Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The next one started
getting a bit more obvious, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've ever been hit on on
the YouTube comment section? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Of course, yes.
- [Garnt] Of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Take me on a date next time
I visit Japan," that happens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, that happens a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got a few of those
comments and it's like, uh, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How about you pay for my date? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wonder if anyone has, ever
in the history of YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably has, would have taken
a comment like that seriously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and tried to pursue it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, if you're like
a smaller YouTuber, maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - For a YouTuber, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean I did something
similar along with email, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> somebody emailed me asking
me to go on a date and- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but there's a
difference between an email </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and a YouTube comment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Anyone can write a YouTube comment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The live, and then obviously, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> people ask you on dates on
livestreams all the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You're streaming, yeah,
I get comments sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, can we on a
date, can we go in Japan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People subtly ask questions that are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think they that they're being subtle, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's very obvious what they're asking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like for example, one very big giveaway, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> as to what some people
are asking are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey, would you ever do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like long distance
relationships by the way?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, some people might
genuinely be curious, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But there's a way that
certain people ask it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is like, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It kind of gives you that vibe of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're asking this for a purpose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And also I get a donation sometimes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which I think that's another one actually, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but where people will be
like, oh, I'm just wondering, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what kind of age group do you go for? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> If it isn't obvious by now, uh, MILFs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Mother knows best, that's what I go for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - All the MILFs rise up right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, you know, if you're around my age- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Lonely housewives, this
is your time to shine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're preparing their
wallets for the next stream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - If your husband is not cutting it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna know who he is, but... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I mean, stuff like
that. What else do I get? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> There's ones as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I get asked a fair amount, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like the least subtle? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is like, would you ever date someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who like, doesn't do YouTube? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, do you think I
exclusively date psychopaths? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, is that what you think? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I only, exclusively, date YouTubers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you don't have at least 10,000 subs- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, you guys date YouTubers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I couldn't imagine dating a YouTuber. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I started dating her </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when she had like less than 1000 subs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's a little bit different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I convinced my
girl to become a YouTuber. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you brought them into the play. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we brought them in, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wouldn't want my significant
other to be a YouTuber. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, I don't wanna
fucking deal with another me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, my schedule
is such a mess already, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that I wouldn't... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like a relationship, to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like that would be such a fucking mess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if both of us had similar
schedules like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I don't blame you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's lots of people who are like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's just me, it's just
me, that's what I want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I feel that's just how
our relationships ended up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's just a
standard work schedule. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] And like this
Stock image, which is a... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Again, it doesn't
really have anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to do with the point but
is a funny Stock image. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh no, no, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just wanted to put a
Stock image in there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> This one, donations again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] The charitable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm pretty sure these
are called simps, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] These are called uh... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] But you can't say that anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Oh yeah, banned off Twitch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, learn to call them, prime members. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - T3 subs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're a prime member, well,
we're going on a date soon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, obviously, you get that a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Actually, Instagram, message requests, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I get that a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Do you actually check them? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, 'cause I used to- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do every now and then just 'cause- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I used to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I used to as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I realized that these are useless </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I stopped checking it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's like throwing
a coin down a well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hoping for it to grow into a tree, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, it's not gonna happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, this is the Stock
image to go along with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't really know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] What is happening there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] They're on a car bonnet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Definitely having sex. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] I'm not really
sure what's going on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] I have no idea
what's going on there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so that's Instagram
messages, completely useless. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't do it, it's not gonna work, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unless you have a shit ton of followers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it pops up, Instagram tells you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah . </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Someone big has messaged you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's like some kind of
threshold of followers, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like having that
blue tick mark on Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - True. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I already mentioned this
one, but just Tinder. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yep.
- [Garnt] Yep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Wait is that the same girl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in front of the burning house? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] It does look
like her, doesn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] It looks like her, doesn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Oh yeah, it kinda does, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Could be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] It could be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe she found a nice career </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Stock images afterwards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who knows? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Also, actually, believe it or not, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been hit on on Fiverr. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Of course you have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] No joke. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Of course you have,
why am I not surprised? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I legitimately had a seller- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sell your services, is that it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Services'. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They were like, "Connor,
I've got a great deal for you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> let me give you a custom offer on Fiverr." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So yeah, actually, funny enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were really a good
sport about it though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they were basically
just kind of like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I had hired them
for one of the videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think they were an artist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What were they trying to buy from you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I hired them, and then
when the video came out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were like, "Oh, thanks
for including me in the video." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But I don't know if you wanna
ever just call or hang out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Here's my discord, and I'm
like, oh, okay, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This man's an absolute chick magnet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, this is what I'm saying, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> When you have, you know... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How many fucking views do we
get a month on our channel? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like eight, nine million
views a month, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> All it takes is one person
to think I'm attractive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Why? I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to then go on and then
do something, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think I'm
inherently more attractive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> than anyone or most people,
you just have a platform. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the thing is like,
I've never experienced that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't think Garnt's
ever experienced that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, not to this- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But, to be fair, I also- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But also I feel like your content- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I do videos
about dating and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, it doesn't surprise me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess you do appeal
more to that kind of crowd. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anyone who has, 'cause
a lot of your content base </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> started off with literal fan interaction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it all started from there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whereas or me, I literally didn't start, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> even for most of my videos,
I don't show my face </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on my videos at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Whereas we don't give
a shit about our fans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> No, I'm just kidding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you don't, you fucking scum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> My whole YouTube career in the start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was built off interaction, and
I'm very grateful for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is why it doesn't surprise me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> why some of the weirdest fan interactions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have come from you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess so. Yeah, that makes sense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you give avenues
for people to talk to you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll find a way to hit on you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's how it works. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now, this is the Stock image. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh my God, what is that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That was me at the end of
the figurine challenge, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's what it felt like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] True, I was just wondering </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what the direction was here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, I'm curious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hey kid, swallow this
fish for us real quick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> He said, all right, I got you fam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Viking kids eating a meal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How much am I getting, $5 for this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've been asked out if
I'd like to go drinking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with someone at a panel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] In front of other people? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] In front of the whole panel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I've had that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like two women, who were, I guess, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my preferred
demographic of older women. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Who were like, would you like to- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Connor was like, I'm listening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, you have my attention. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Connor goes through his analytics, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he picks by demographic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> He's just like, get rid of all this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this is like 25 to 30, no, none of that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> too close an age. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 35 to 45, ooh.
- Ooh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So legit, I think it
was two women, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think one was the aunt
and one was the mother </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the daughter they brought along. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she just sticks her
hand up and she's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "I have no idea who you
are but I like your voice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Would you be willing to
have drinks with us later?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The mom said that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The mum said that, and
I've never seen a child </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go from like smiling to anger so fast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> The child's like, mom, mom, mom! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The child's like, I was gonna say that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was just like, yeah,
I'd love to, jokingly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I never did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Honestly, if they came up me afterwards, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course you would. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or found me at the bar,
I'd have been like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love talking, I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> moms are so fun to talk
to at anime conventions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> No, not in the hitting
on way, just in general. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> They're so fun, dude, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause they don't give a fuck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're like, "I don't know
what the fuck is happening, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm the cool parent
that was willing to come </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to the anime convention. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - To be fair, it's at a signing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and a mom or a dad comes
with their son or daughter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're always so chill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they're like... Yeah,
they're the best people also. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, they are pretty chill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - See? Meilyne is trying
to make it creepy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not fucking creepy, Meilyne. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's 'cause you specifically said moms. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love talking to parents at conventions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just like dads, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Give me all the moms. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, I've had like a... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh wait, I don't know
if it comes up later. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll tell it later, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but basically there was this
one guy I've had before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like his kids really
liked me and he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah, can I buy you
dinner or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, yeah, fucking sure, why not? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll talk to you, we'll
hang out and be nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was nice getting
to know him and his kids, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that was cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I've had the same
things with dads as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're just cool, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - If a dad's willing to
get involved in this shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> then they're a cool fucking dad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - When that happens and they show passion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about what their kid is passionate about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's so fucking cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a good parent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wish my parents did that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause my parents didn't do that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they would never do that to this day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think the proudest mom I've ever seen, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it was at AIX and we had signings, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then two little kids come </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and, you know, they were cute and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the mum looks at me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she like sees my name and everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and she goes, asked me
in Thai, "Are you Thai?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then I reply in Thai and then
we have this conversation, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and she was just like,
I am so fucking happy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that my kids are looking
up to a Thai person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thank you for representing
the Thai people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I am proud of you, thank you very much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had the opposite once in Finland, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where the mum was a big fan
and the daughter had no idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the mom came up and was
like, "Can you sign this?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - God, I wish that was me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She was like, "Can you sign this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, yeah, sure,
and I looked at the daughter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, okay, what's your name? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I looked at the daughter and
I was like, what's your name? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the mom was like,
"No, no, no, it's me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, Oh okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cause I feel like for
Southeast Asian parents, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Anytime you talk to a
Southeast Asian parent, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever you meet someone
else who is the same race, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every Southeast Asian mother especially, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they go into Southeast Asian mum mode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So the first thing she legit asks me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after finding out I'm
Thai and just, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> asking the basic questions, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is have you had any Thai
food recently? 'Cause I can- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've gotta eat good Thai food, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you gotta have good Thai food, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I could recommend you some places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're missing some Thai food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, dude, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> honestly I'm like, thank you so much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm going to take this advice to heart. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause honestly yes, I
am missing Thai food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I am missing home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause also like moms or
like parents have come up to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and are like, do you want a water? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You look like you're tired. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, thank you, I'll take this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thank you, that's so kind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've had a dad just slip me a $20, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> being like, buy yourself
a beer after this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you're working real hard today, son. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, thanks man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had one time similar to that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but there is, actually, an
old Patreon of mine met me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and her grandma came, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and she must have been
like 78, I'm not sure, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and she was just so impressed
that I wrote in cursive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She was like, in the most hick, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> not hick, it was kinda like Midwestern, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like, "Oh, you
know, it's just not right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They teach the kids here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they don't teach them
how to write cursive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not right, I really like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you keep the old ways alive." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, I'm just British. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I have no fucking clue
what you guys are doing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, I don't know if it's that good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because no one can read
my fucking handwriting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I mean, honestly,
what your kid's doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is probably already pretty good actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, also the Stock image, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually found one that
was fitting for this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Pregnant lady with a gun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] With the tiniest
gun I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] That's like a... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] That's like a BB gun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] That's like a German pistol, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like World War Two, that looks like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] That's like the spy gun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they like hide in a purse, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah, is this a scene </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> from like "Inglorious
Bastards" or something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] This is
definitely a frame taken </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from a Quentin Tarantino movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Uh, fuck, oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This wasn't so much odd. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This wasn't being hit on but
this is just a funny story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanted to tell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So one time I was at a convention, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I actually have this
guy on Facebook still, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so he's really nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But it was very strange
and things kept adding on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and adding on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I went to it and
they were like, okay... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When you go to a convention as a guest, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> typically if it's a big convention, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll get like a handler. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like an assistant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, basically someone who makes sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you turn up to your
appointments on time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and also if you need anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like let's say you're signing things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you run out of sharpies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, can you give me a sharpy real quick? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They'll do stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the guy I had, he was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh yeah, my daughter's a big fan." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, cool, cool that's awesome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like, "Would you
mind saying hi to her?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, yeah, of course, of course, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like I'll hang out with him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then he was really nice
and he helped me out a lot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> he always got me whatever I needed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he was like,
"Yeah, do you wanna come </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for a family dinner
with me and my family?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I felt like I had to say yes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was like, oh sure,
of course, I don't mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, this guy's
helping you out right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean, I literally
had nothing better to do, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, yeah sure, why
not? You've been real nice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I'd love to meet your family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> His family was like 12 kids or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Half of them knew who I was,
and half of them didn't care, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was like being in the middle of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was it "Half A Dozen"?
What's that movie called? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck is that family movie called? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know what you're talking about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - By the dozen, or something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it was really cool 'cause
I think he was a foster parent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or something and it was really cool, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the story was really unique. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not being hit on by the way,
at all, quite the opposite, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just thought it's a cool story to tell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just thought it was really odd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I got like roped into this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, what is happening? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is there 12 kids? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - All I can envision is
that seen from "Annie", </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they're all eating
on the really long table </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're just in the middle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm in the middle of these 12 kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I felt bad 'cause the
dad was trying to talk to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but obviously all the kids were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yo, it's the YouTuber!"
They wanted my attention, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and he kept asking me questions, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and they could be like,
"Do you pay taxes?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or something like that,
and I'm like, well- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - A four year old asking you is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are you avoiding taxes? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you the IRS? Kids, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, it was just really cool, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I felt it was a fun story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Well, that was
just a morbid Stock image. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] This is a hell of a Stock image. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] I don't know why
this was the Stock image. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Getty, why do you have this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes you just look at Stock images </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and you think in what context </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would someone want to use this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What was the direction they had when- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, I do think there
is like a small market, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a small market of Stock
Image photographers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that are like, I'm hoping
this is gonna become a meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm betting that this, I'm
gonna take some meme photos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and hope that this becomes- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're all racing to
be the next meme, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To become the next
jealous girlfriend meme guy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this is definitely giving
me that energy right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. For sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, this is the
unexpected, if you will. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me show you the
Stock image first of all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have a good stock image. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Now that's a
Tarantino shot right there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] My cigar with the
boys, we kidnapped somebody. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So one time, like you said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the daughters bring their mothers along. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And one time they were
both really big fans, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I thought, well
that's so fucking cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, I didn't
really think much of it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like she was joking, being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> she said I looked like Tom cruise, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, I do not
look like Tom cruise, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I look quite the opposite of Tom cruise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is this basically every Reddit post </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who has like a white guy with a beard, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're like that looks
like Connor, that guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, that's Connor man,
the white beard checks out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I was, oh okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they were like,
are you're seeing anyone? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like legit asked me this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, the mom was on you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the mom asked me that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> while I'm signing the
daughter's autograph. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I thought, Oh, not really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She was like, "Oh, okay, do
you wanna get a drink later?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, ah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, yeah, sure, sure, sure, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking like this isn't serious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Found out later she was very serious, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and she was very disappointed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we didn't have that drink. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I thought it was joking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You basically stood her up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You stood up a MILF, Connor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not proud to say it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The world is gonna end tomorrow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not proud to say, but yeah I did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Connor, I had expected better from you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I believe it was a single
mother as well, actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, that's like your fantasy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> The thing with MILF porn, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You see, you don't see the kids, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that's a big plus, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna fucking know about the kids, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't tell me about the kids, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't wanna get involved. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What's wrong Meilyne? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Meilyne] So what if they call, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if you get married and
they have to call you dad? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor exclaiming) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's so gross. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, some people are
into the daddy thing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's the fantasy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Listen, the problem with the
whole MILF dynamic in real life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is there are a lot of hurdles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that make it very
uncomfortable and very awkward. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would feel so sorry
for the fucking daughter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Imagine being a fan- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I felt sorry for the daughter as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Imagine being a fan of a YouTuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they become your dad, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let's just think about that for a second. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is like a visual
novel in the making. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He was my favorite
YouTuber, but now he's my dad? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But actually it was the daughter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that ended up being like, oh, I'm sorry, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> my mom just gets carried away sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, your mom's on the
prowl next to you, with her? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> What kind of dynamic are you guys using? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Your mom's in cougar mode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You guys are real close
to be like scouting out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the prey with each other,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Her mom's like, yo, become my wing-woman </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what it was, it was
like a wing-man. It was crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's nuts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] Domestic boyfriend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Domestic boyfriend.
- Domestic boyfriend. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like love triangles, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, in a porno or a hentai, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's very attractive in the hentai, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you realize in real
life, fuck, it's a nightmare. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's messy as fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you have anything like
that, it never ends well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that was definitely
unexpected, that's for sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was the unexpected. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually got hit on,
on "Overwatch" one time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh yeah? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was fun.
- [Joey] How so? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, someone recognized who
I was and then I added them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I started playing with them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then just casually started inquiring </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about my love life and
stuff, and that's normal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Were they like role playing
or anything like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - At which part of your
career was this in? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which part of the career?
When did "Overwatch" come out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like literally three four months </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> into "Overwatch" being released. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, okay.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was a while ago then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was like four or five years ago? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yikes, I'm old. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Whenever "Overwatch"
came out, this happened, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, I remember it
just being a bit awkward </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because they kept asking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when someone normally
inquires about your love life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an a bit of uncomfortable amount </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when you don't really
know them, which is fine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean you can ask me about
that, I'm pretty open about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I never mind talking about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then when you proceed
to ask me the next step, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like you live in Norway, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, it's kind of far, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even know what's in Norway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> There's no benefits to getting
married to someone in Norway, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm joking, I'm joking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, and then this is
uh, yeah, this is it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Oh this is
almost what it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> at the urinal for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] So when we see
each other at the urinal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or, you know, how do I say urinal? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Urinal.
- Urinal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that what Americans say? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, that's what the British say, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, we say urinals. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Urinal.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought the British said urinal? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, Americans say urinal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never heard
someone say urinal before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've said urinal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've only heard British
people say urinal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what? I get confused
on what words I'm saying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on British and American, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause people constantly correct me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even though I know I'm not wrong, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but they say, why does
he say it like that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I ended up
unconsciously changing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I go back to the UK
and now everyone mocks me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for sounding American. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't even know what,
like sometimes I say a word </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I don't even know if
that's said in a British way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or an American way anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but that's it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's this power point
presentation, boom, done, thank you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was a hell of a presentation, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> thank you for your Ted talk, sir. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Thanks guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Why aren't you clapping Meilyne? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Clap louder, Meilyne, I couldn't hear you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What lessons did we learn? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Connor's fans are fucking weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you are a woman above the age of 35? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 35, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that what you think my demo is? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes.
- I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just like older than me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that what you think
it is? You are correct. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Listen, you can see- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How old are you at right now, 24? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm 24, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, so late 20s </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Twenty four and a half year
olds are gonna be like, Ooh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm in the zone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some people age like wine,
man, they age better, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They get more attractive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Why are you laughing,
Meilyne? It's true though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's true.
- Yeah, it's true </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some people, you see pictures of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you see them when they're
younger, like celebrities, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you see them when the
older and you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> holy shit, he's 50 but he's
hotter than he ever was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly, to me it's like,
as long as the mindset is there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that you're in my world
and you're on the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> wavelength of thinking and
you treat life the same way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't give a fuck about your age. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I feel like some people- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - As long as you're hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just don't want you
to be younger than me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't wanna fucking
date someone younger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like some people
just hit a certain age </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they just stop giving
a shit about how they look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and taking care of themselves, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or alternatively, they just
think they can get away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the lifestyle they had in their 20s, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and just bring that to like the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - 40s and 50s. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Their entire 30s, 40s and 50s. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause, you know, I think being 30 now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as the only 30 year old, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've heard that being 30
is just basically being 20 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with one debuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And shit blood. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and shit blood, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And yeah, I mean, I feel
like some people do age </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like fucking fine wine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and a lot of Asians just don't age at all, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess until they've
reached like this cap, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they just start aging like crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then they're like,
oh, we have to age, oh okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, also going back to
the naming me after a baby, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it wasn't an insult by the way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just wanna make sure that's clear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think that's like a bad thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just looked very
intense, just quite a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I've never heard
any other story like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so overwhelming that you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which emotion do I take away from this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I put myself in your
shoes and the biggest, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I'm like trying to be like POV, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you are Connor holding a
baby that's named after you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, how do I even- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cue the pump music. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do I even manage
what to say right now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't even know how to react. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like a mixture of
overwhelming flattery, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> overwhelming, like what the
fuck, are you sure about this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are you sure about that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, is this a mistake? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are you gonna regret this?
'Cause I'm not all that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What else did we take away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the power point presentation boys? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What did you learn today? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You get hit on a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, it's actually... You know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You get hit on a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So my audience has gone
from, as we know, 93%, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> recently it went to like 60% male. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's cause of all the
Jojo shit you've been doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jojo, I think also there
was a good amount of time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where, I think because of my thumbnails, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the topics I was covering, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> YouTube just didn't recommend me to guys, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and now it's suddenly started being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh wait, guys can watch this guy too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I started getting a
massive influx of guy views </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I never had before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I stopped doing as much yowie stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and slowed down on that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But, I mean, it's still like nearly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it depends on the month, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like depending on the videos I make. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's about 50, 50 now, which is nice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's slowed down a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But there's ups and downsides, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it was mainly... I
know that I spoke about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mainly it was girls coming up to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but, dude, guys hit on me just as much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I've had that one as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which was flattering,
'cause there was like one dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who was in my Instagram message request, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the man was fucking ripped as fuck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, wow, I'm very flattered. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This man had like the
body of a Greek statue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this man thought I was
worthy of being hit on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was very flattered. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm jealous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right? I was like, damn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, I mean, it's whatever,
it's just fucking YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, what I can take about this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that if there is going to be an avenue, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not necessarily to be hit on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but for someone to get
in contact with you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I would say half of
these were just, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the fan interactions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or people trying to get
in contact with you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If there's an avenue,
people are gonna find a way, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I've definitely felt
that as YouTuber as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, you can hit on me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's very flattering, I don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't have to stop doing
it, just not be creepy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just do it in a sophisticated way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah man, you do it sleek, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll be like, thank you for the ego boost. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna go away feeling
great, and who doesn't? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Dude, you get hit on
you're like, damn I'm a 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you go back to your hotel room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and eat a whole bag of
flaming hot Cheetos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and realize you're truly a five. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And also, on the opposite
end, taking this advice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for any young budding YouTubers out there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tread carefully with fans hitting on you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't fuck your fans,
man. It never works out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Listen, you know, it might
work out one tenth of the time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the problem is that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But are you willing to take the risk? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's a risk- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, you have to be really careful, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think the biggest problem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that whenever you're like
a YouTuber starting out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially when you're a small YouTuber, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like this is more a
message to small YouTubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who don't have the experience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or don't think they're gonna get big, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you don't fucking know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're gonna get big, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But you should treat the fans, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or you should treat your audience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no matter how big you
are, exactly the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And stay grounded. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I mean, I'm sure there's
cringy messages out there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of me hitting on someone at 19
that would just embarrass me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But, again, I'm 19, you
know, just fucking delete it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, you're like kind of- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It wasn't like I hit on fans
and be like, send me nudes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just like me being an
average 19 year old, basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly, when you're younger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't really have the senses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to know what exactly is cringe or not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also when you're younger,
you're just horny as fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you think you can
get away with being horny, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you grow up and you realize, man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I did a lot of stupid shit back then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, young, dumb, and
full of cum, as they say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Lovely, Joey. Words to live by. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But I mean, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause there's some people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, there's a lot
of YouTubers out there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who are very openly happy to
admit that they date fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, well, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> normal famous celebrities
get to fuck their fans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and no one bats an eye,
and it's like, well- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that double standard
propagated, and it's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but the reason why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the way I interpret it
and the why that's the case, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that normal celebrities
they don't bank on the fact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of relatability, they don't
bank on the fact of being- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're like people above the clouds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like every pop star is
supposed to be like a character, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like an absurd kind of,
not real person, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They never pretend to be your friend, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they never like pretend
to give a shit about you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and if you have sex with them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they probably don't give about it, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe, maybe it's just a joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I mean, if you do it
with an influencer, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Ugh, a gross word, or a YouTuber, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hate that word, influencer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Influencer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess it's almost kind of a betrayal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of what you built up which
is like a lot of the people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who watch us, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess, I don't know if you guys know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you guys feel this way, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you form like a bit of a bond, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where you respect the creator
and you look up to them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you enjoy their stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you feel a lot closer to a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than you would a normal celebrity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so it's that that's
being taken advantage of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, it's because most
of YouTubers are more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess, grounded, right?
And feel more real, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so when you do watch
them, you're just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, this is an actual person I'm watching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I would say the
right way to go about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're going to get
involved with your fans, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the biggest things is
you don't do it straight away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you need to treat them- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Start as a friend. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Start as a friend, treat
them like a human being, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get to know each other first, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like any normal fucking relationship </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You need to immediately
like break down or disassemble </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> any power dynamic in play,
of like fan, YouTuber, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you put yourself on equal footing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and with stuff like
one night stands or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that gets so messy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's no way to like differentiate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is there a power dynamic there? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is the person gonna do this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then, you know, regret
it afterwards and just... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's too messy to be
able to justify, I feel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and there is a right
way to go about it and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's lots of ways to go about it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but most of the time it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> do you wanna diffuse a bomb? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you know how to, and you
wanna do that, go ahead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a right way to do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's not worth the
risk most of the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but is it worth- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it worth the risk? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not worth the risk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're literally blowing
yourself up in terms of career. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, is it worth it? Or you
could just, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do what everyone else
fucking does in the world, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and just date normally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I feel like a lot
of smaller YouTubers, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't really think about this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they think I've
got nothing to lose, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I'm just gonna do this
right now while I can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you grow up in
a culture where, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you do see, you know,
celebrities and like groupies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sleeping with, you know, music artists </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything like
that, and you think, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that sounds like an awesome lifestyle, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I kind of want that lifestyle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So when they get like a smidgen of that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they think I gotta take advantage of this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> while I still can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The rock and roll lifestyle
works if you're in that field, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the rock and roll lifestyle
is not the YouTuber lifestyle, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's two completely
different things, I find. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. it's tough, it's so tough, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's not even worth
like getting into, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause I feel like
to get involved in this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you are literally navigating a minefield. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, 100%. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like if you really
wanna do it, you can do it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the reason why I think
most YouTubers will say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't fuck your fans is
because it's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so much risk you're
taking on for no reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And to me it's like, do
you really want someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who wants to be with you for your videos? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Why is that attractive? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're looking at you only
for the content you make. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me it's a competitive mindset. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me, that's like a massive turnoff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If they're only with me
because of my content, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then that's like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> The same thing, if you're
only my friends for my content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> then you can't be my friend, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because that's not how
I would see a friend, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the same way that's how I
wouldn't see a possible partner </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like saying like,
oh, so if I change my content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> then you're suddenly not my friend. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There is no bigger turn on, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Than meeting someone who
just likes you for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sitting there thinking like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how the fuck am I
supposed to be into this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then like get my dick hard
when all I'm thinking about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're thinking is like, what's
the next upload gonna be? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? Like, fuck that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> No, I want someone who speaks to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> knows nothing about YouTube,
and is like, holy shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this guy's fucking cool,
I like him, he's so nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You want people to see
you as Connor not CdDawgVA. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, which obviously I made
a bit difficult for myself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously, but I can still go about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, of course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't wanna be with a
girl, be in bed and be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yo, if you enjoyed that
session, hit the subscribe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and click the like button. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - If we get to 5,000
likes, I'll do round two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I want video a YouTube video
of someone trying to do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like... Oh my God, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's just so many
douche-tubers out there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> who do shit like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sure there's YouTubers out there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who will just admit
every single fucking day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, yeah, I fucked my fans so what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, screw them. But if
you wanna have like, you know- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you wanna be
respected by the community </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, if you wanna be
seen as like a role model, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what that is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, like douche-tubers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel, just exist on a
different plane of existence </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where, I don't know how
they function or, you know- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just want YouTubers to
have a better rep, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like not all of us are
fucking psychopath, uh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> validating chasing,
- Money hungry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, a lot of us are horny
motherfuckers and that's just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's just human nature. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A lot of us are horny
but we do it the right way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Mother Knows Breasts"
on Blu-ray, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We are three horny guys, but
at least we're horny on main, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we keep to being horny on main </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's pretty much it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A part of me is glad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is that I have YouTube to
keep me in check almost, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not that I would start doing awful shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if I wasn't a YouTuber. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the fact that there
is this kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obvious moral lines that it's not like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> oh no, man, should I do.., No, it's not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're like these
unspoken guidelines and rules </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to like, make sure
you're not overstepping. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Being an ass, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It really makes me cautious
about how I come off to people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and what I say to people, it
makes me way more conscious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about how I speak in a
way that I think is... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, the way I speak on live streams, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the way I speak, you know, on the video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is how I'll speak to
most people in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I like that it's kind
of taught me, in a way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to just be, it sounds awful, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But just give a shit about
everything and pay attention </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even if it is draining at times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It sounds awful, I'm like,
you should have taught me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to be not an asshole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, you know how some
things you take for granted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're an individual
who isn't like a open person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it didn't teach me to give
a shit about everything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it did teach me to really
question my own values. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] That's a
better way of putting it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and really justify,
is this value I hold right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> As opposed to like, I'll just think about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just think of it this way, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I grew up in
that kind of environment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it really made me self reflect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like that is like
a healthy part of YouTube, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I've become a better
person because of YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's about that mentality of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, if I wasn't doing
YouTube, then are the things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I do and the way
that I talk to people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and that kind stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> would that be still considered
respectful to other people, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> regardless of if I had this job or not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Would I still be a good person
if I didn't have YouTube? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And if the answer is yes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> then I think if you're following it right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Very worrying if the answer is no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, I mean, you know, look
at all the douche-tubers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> apparently you can get away with that shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you have a YouTube channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, do they get
away with that shit though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, there's a reason
why they have an audience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're on borrowed time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are they looking at tweet
longer, waiting to happen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're not gonna be at
the point that they are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for very long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I feel like a big, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, this is getting to
a really deep topic now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but a big problem with a lot
of these like apology videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and, you know, a lot
of this kind of culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that has been built up, I
understand where it comes from, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where we do need to
keep each other in check </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and make sure that people
aren't abusing their power. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But a part of it just
makes me feel like, man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people are just treating this
like one big reality TV show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's not keeping each other check, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've just made it a modern Coliseum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We just gamified it basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you know, we
can't kill each other, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the best thing we can do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is fucking get at each
other's throats online. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, which is why now
when I see an apology video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> or a tweet longer, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of like, as we said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we were taught to have to
give a shit about this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but sometimes I see this and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't have the energy
to care about this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this doesn't involve me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, sometimes it fucking sucks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I hear about, you know,
some person in the community </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or in some community that
I'm not even involved in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having like a 50 page dissertation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> breaking down every
shitty thing they've done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, I'm sorry
that this happened, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but at the same time, like
I don't have the energy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to invest myself into this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Can someone literally give me a cliff note </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of what's going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, I don't want to be the guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like can you tell me what to think? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But there reaches a point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where there's too much happening
right now that you can- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like sensory overload of drama. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's just like,
at the end of the day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> all I'm seeing is someone's
getting fucking paid leave, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's all I'm seeing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like I have limited
time, I have limited energy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I wanna be able to use it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on shit I actually care about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I would like to care
about every big scandal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every big thing that gets
brought up on Twitter, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and, you know, that's, logically, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and if I would think about it
that's what I want to value, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but logistically you can't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can't care about this much shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I feel like a big problem right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that this entire environment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just feels like "Big Brother", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or this feels like a reality TV show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where people care, but
do they really care? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it gets to a point
where, does this really... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where I think, does this
is really involve me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, am I doing
something right to society </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> by getting involved with this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or am I just feeding
the fumes and the fire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just making the
environment more toxic? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you have thick enough
skin, nothing's stopping you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If you don't care that everyone hates you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're fine with that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then there's literally
nothing stopping you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> from succeeding on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, there's people who make a career </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off of being hated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, plenty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, one of
the biggest examples, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is of course, Logan Paul. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember who said this quote </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think it was like
Muhammad Ali or a boxer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where they said something like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if people will pay to like... What was it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> People will pay to shut you up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, people will pay
to watch you get punched </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, watch you get punched, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or watch you shut the fuck up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something along those lines. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And man, Logan Paul has
capitalized that to the max. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I'll fucking admit, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got involved with whenever Logan Paul </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gets into a boxing match </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I watched the boxing
matches, of course I did, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna see Logan Paul
get punched a bunch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just funny, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I don't really
have anything personally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> against the guy, obviously, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's just fun seeing two YouTubers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> smack each other in the face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This shit's funny as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd do that if the right target came up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, yo, how much money did he make? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Put me in the ring, give
me some beef, please. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Give me some beef to fight over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pay per view, anyone? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's scary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Scary how it's evolved
to that point, isn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It makes you wonder what the next step is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're going back to where we started, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where, you know, when
reality is this entertaining, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who the fuck needs TV? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I've been saying
the whole time gone, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Reality has always been more entertaining. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Documentaries are the new movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, man, you can't
make this shit up, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can make up all these "Harry Potters" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and "Lord Of The Rings",
that's epic and all, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love those films but you
can't make up the weird shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that happens in real life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's been "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But you know what hasn't
been "Trash Taste"? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Without us reading the Patreons, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that didn't make any sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That made no sense at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, where are you going with this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's do it, "Trash Taste" Patreon, woo! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, look at all these Patreons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They love him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This guy has giga-brain,
giga monkey brain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hey, if you'd like to join the Patreon, </SPEAKER_03>
