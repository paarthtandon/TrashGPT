<SPEAKER_01> - Who left this dent on the table? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would like to know this.
It's been here a while. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm going to say Chris. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And who was the last person
sitting in this point point? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Chris. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, technically it was me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're blaming on Chris.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Must have been Chris. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hello and welcome back to Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm your host for today, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And once again with me are the boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is technically our first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Trash Taste recording
of 2021, even though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, you just stated it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know (laughs) I know, I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The matter is ruined. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The immersion, Gar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> The immersion is ruined. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - People can tell, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I like how people are
able to tell the time line </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of when Trash Taste recordings happen now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> based on Joey's hair. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, because it's
like one week I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, he has a lot of hair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the next week is
like, oh, he has no hair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's your hair and my beard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like one week I just
decided I'm gonna grow a beard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We are the sun dale of
Trash Taste basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like I'm calculating
the shading of Garnt's face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I can definitely guess
its sometime around January. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like the beard on you,
Garnt. I think it suits you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think it looks good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I did it literally
after a Trash Taste recording. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> When I went back after that recording </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where we talked about beards and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Sydney, should I grow a beard?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And Sydney is like, "Just do it, why not?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And yeah, I kinda like it
now. It's a grown on me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Pun intended. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm already getting the dad jokes now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Shave it off right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Jesus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, we've just come back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from our Christmas holidays, which is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think this was one of the
first Christmas holidays </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that actually felt like
Christmas holiday for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because normally Christmas holidays </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are the busiest time of the year for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I'm trying to get
like my end of year video out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I don't know
what switched in my mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to make me realize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what if I just don't do that
and give myself some time off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then I put the video
out sometime next month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt discovers the word no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> For the first time, he's like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Taking a break. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I can say that now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait a minute. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You mean the expectations
were just all in my head </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and no one really cares if
I just delayed the video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like a few weeks? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Never trust anyone. Not even yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You mean I was my own worst enemy? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel I, one, I'm just
recover from being sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So if I'm a little quiet-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He doesn't have Covid, don't worry guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I'm negative boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm also negative in
life. I'm always negative. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just described yourself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm a negative person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just negative. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What happened? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you had like a sore
throat or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I had like a
really bad sore throat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it just kinda went
and now I'm in the last days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where I still sound sick,
but I feel totally fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But just-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You, you were sipping that
Manuka honey over there though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do Manuka honey is opious fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is, it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It just costs an arm and a leg. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the problem, I
remember I saw the other day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like a jar, this
big, of Manuka honey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe like that, it was like 60 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is Manuka honey? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's this-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - From a plant, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's a type of
honey made from a certain, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think species of bee that's
only found in New Zealand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know it's New Zealand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. It's like a Kiwi bee basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like halfway between, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember 'cause I saw a
whole business insider video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, yeah, 'cause
they did like a, you know-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought they pollinated
something really specific </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like this is the-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's probably. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is the honey
that it spanked on this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure it's something
like the bee takes the pollen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> from a specific plant and
only makes honey out of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something like that. But yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know it's like a Kiwi thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the reason is because like
just the whole process of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is really long and arduous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And also it's halfway between
Royal jelly and honey, I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's how it kind of works. I
don't know. I don't remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I always recommend it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really hard to recommend
'cause people are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You're paying how much
for a jar of honey?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can I not just buy honey? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just normal honey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It doesn't do the same thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Normal peasant, honey bee, honey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Peasant like peasant bee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you pour honey, it pours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The like Manuka honey stuff doesn't pour. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like molasses. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It literally is like a block. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I normally like if I scream a bunch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or I'm doing a lot of voice acting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll normally just take
like a little teaspoon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not fill it up just like a
little bit. I'll just eat it-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I don't know why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because there are a lot of
products that are very expensive, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'd say that they're
not that much different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> from the base product. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Manuka, honey versus normal honey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But Manuka, honey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what it is. I
don't know if it is a placebo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - but--
- It could be placebo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It could be a placebo, but
every time I've taken some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like my sore throat
just immediately goes away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's that whole thing of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> are you wearing a product
or are you wearing a brand? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Kind of thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> When it comes to like
clothes, for example. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yo, these bees like
minted by Louis Vulton </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, what's going on there? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you look really close
on the side of the body, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it says LV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're like branded with LV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then the bees coming in
with like the drip jacket, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like hello. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They come to the flower like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hello, I'm here to pollinate you." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Correction, Manuka honey
is not from a specific bee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's from the Manuka flower. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it is a flower. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. So it's a specific
plant they pollinate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You confused me, I said plant-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sorry, sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then Joey came in like
a wrecking ball with bees </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, hold on. I'm
pretty sure it's a plant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. It's the plant
wearing the drip jackets then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Should have been more aggressive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I know Joey, it's a plant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I disagree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Half this podcast is
that doesn't sound right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But my, Manuka honey knowledge, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't enough to dispute you on that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - People have Google. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. 'Cause I've
tried a bunch of things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I've tried that really
expensive pink Himalayan salt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That is the, most of the cost
goes in into mining this salt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's like one of the rarest salts, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the hardest salts to mine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - True, they sell at my supermarket. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They sell at my supermarket. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do they actually? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I've got some. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's probably not real
from it is two bucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's definitely not
sea with pink dye on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's probably sea pink diet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it says Himalayan salt on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Got it for like 150 Yen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That ain't right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I actually tried the
second, most expensive, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's the second most, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's one of the most
expensive coffee beans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is how they harvest this coffee bean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is I believe it's like this, the cat poop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We've seen the bucket list, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We've seen the movie. We know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why it became really popular </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause in the bucket list,
there was this whole big joke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the movie was the
fact that he didn't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this expensive coffee
this rich guy was buying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was from pooped out cat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which film was this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - "The Bucket List" with Morgan
Freeman and Jack Nicholson. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh that one. Okay. I
haven't seen that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know why. I know
that movie, I've never seen it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just know it's that like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought you were just
talking about a bucket list, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a default bucket list that everyone has. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - "The Bucket List". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is why that coffee
became so well known. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I've never known that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Well it was obviously
it was a thing before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a massive part of
the movie was a big joke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that this guy was like, he was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "I have to have this coffee." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he didn't know this whole
time that he was eating like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cat that was pooping it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not actually cats.
It's a kind of like--- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like a mountain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like a mountain, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like a big joke in the movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that he's eating the poop beans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's like, and then yeah-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And Hillarian shoes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why it became so well known. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's why everyone knows it, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What I'm more surprised of the fact that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they talk about that in "The Bucket List" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the fact that you've
seen "The Bucket List". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you mean? It's
it's an amazing fit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, you're the
only one I know who's seen it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jack Dickson and Morgan Freeman. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're gonna sit and tell
me you don't wanna watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was one of those movies
that I saw like in my, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, I'm dating myself here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I saw at my local
blockbuster back in the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would say, it was one of those ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that was always on that
highlighted shelf of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> these are the talked about movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was always smack bang in the middle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was fucking Jack Nicholson,
Morgan Freeman doing that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that kind of face. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It just says "The Bucket List". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That looks boring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why did you not watch "The Bucket List"? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. It's
just never interested me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't even know about it until now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's very good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How did they react to it in the movie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He was like shocked obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And distraught that he'd
been eating the beans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did he enjoy the coffee? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Was it good coffee? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, so he was obsessed with this coffee, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but he didn't know where it was from. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And because Jack Nicholson in the movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> plays a very wealthy man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he has all the money in the world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And Morgan Freeman is in the
same hospital room as him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and his has no money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's this whole joke of
Morgan Freeman's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, by the way, I found
out about those beans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "that you like so much,
the cats poop them out." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it's like, "Haha,
rich man eats poop." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> That was it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was the tagline for
the movie, "The Bucket List" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Rich man eats poop."
- "Rich man eats poop." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's very good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It it's a very good movie.
I'm not selling you on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really good. It's really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Man, "Rich man eats
poop." That's selling me on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Connor sells a movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So this rich guy eats shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I tried it and
it was just, it was-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because Sydney gave it to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Sydney was making
this massive ceremony </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about how it's the biggest
fucking deal on earth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've had it before as well.
And it's a good up of coffee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] It's a good cup of coffee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But is it like to die for? No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll be honest. I can tell-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Would I put it on my bucket list? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Probably not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know how much Sydney grinded </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when she made our cups of coffee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because when she made our cups of coffee, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like I had three, a
triple espresso or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Me and Sydney were just
sitting in our chairs, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being like, "Honey, I know it's Christmas, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "but I think I need to
go out and go for a run. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I just had so much energy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "that I couldn't even think straight." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh my God.
- [Connor] It's poop man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the poop. It's the poop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the poop poop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It it's the poop. It's the poop poop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> What is it about poop? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I was actually
researching this right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well we just to not talk about poop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Of course Scott somehow brought it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's trash Taste. Of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You were researching poop. Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, cause after that I
was researching the coffee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that used to be the most
expensive coffee in the world, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I assume because of "The Bucket List". </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But now there's a more expensive coffee, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is based on elephant
poop and it comes from Thailand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like, what is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> What is up with-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's stopping me from
ingesting coffee beans, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pooping them out and then just
putting the highest price tag </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on it and labeling it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Sea Dog VA espresso. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Sea Dog VA expressway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've actually seen
a Japanese YouTube do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Actually no way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. They did it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was absolutely disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> No, I'm not gonna describe
the video obviously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But just, you get a sense of the idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why? Did he sell it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, you didn't sell it.
He got friends to drink it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Got it. Trying to drink it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You are eating, you're drinking my shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] You're drinking my shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your trash tastes special. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know how that's
on YouTube. It's disgusting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why does YouTube play for different-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That reminds me of the story I saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> about the reality TV star </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that started selling their fats. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you hear about this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then she got a heart
attack because of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then she farted so much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it gave her gastritis
or stomach problems </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that she thought she had a heart attack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and had to go an A$E. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] What an amazing story? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. And so after that,
she's just like, you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I should stop selling farts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what does she do? She
starts selling farts as NFTs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you serious? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] I am deadly serious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is a month old news by
the time you're watching this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was very dumb. It was so stupid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm seeing this and I'm
just like, you know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can we go back to black mirror? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Can we please go back to black mirror? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That is the future that I want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - All these game companies
as well being like NFTs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we like them. And it's like, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you can make money from them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you can rip us off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. So sometimes you
just sigh at the future. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes you-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Back up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How do you, she's selling
her farts as an NFT? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know how that works. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't, you know, I maybe-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is she's selling a picture
of her farting into a jar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as an NFT. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe she farts on the
keyboard and then there's some-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The fart infuse letter E-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you know how like in the movies, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when there's, someone's typed
in their code on the PC, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you blow the dust on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You see the fingerprint. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Basically what
happens is that she just farts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the keyboard and whenever
the fart is like traced </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the board, she types out the numbers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe she has a fart scanner
where digitizes her farts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into bits and that gets
converted to an NFT, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which can put on the blockchain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Here's my fart binary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - God, I hate the internet
so much right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, they recently,
Japan just made a screen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that you could taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. The likable screen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. The likable screen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it's all concepts.
Mayland's like salivating, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which you like saw that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I never wanna lick a screen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like half the good foods
because of the textures. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. What I wanna
know is like this screen, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the screens are like
dirty enough as it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're telling me that
there's gonna be people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> constantly licking the screen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Are you gonna have to clean
it every time you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a single leak? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have we not learned
anything from this pandemic? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is literally the
worst idea in the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why did you have to announce it now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I bet George, your
fans would be happy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, oh my God, I can (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Finally, I can leave out
my dream of liking sweat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God. I, I just can't
get over the fart NFT. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's pretty bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wonder, I just wanna
know how it works now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. I thought we had kids. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can you Google this actually for us? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you Google fart NFT? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How this works please. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought humanity had hit its low </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when Belle Delphine was
selling her bath water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Who knew that that was just the beginning? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> She was trying to warn us of the future. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think a lot of people
sell their bath water now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was but the Genesis </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of the apocalypse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I'm sure a lot of
people sell bath water now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure a lot people-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No one buys it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll be honest. I don't
browse only fans so much, so-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So much (laughs) you
proud as only fans at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I don't browse only fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt has a secret only fans
account but We don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Just comes out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I don't know what
people are selling on only fans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if I wanna
know what people are selling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on only fans, if this is the
kind of that gets leaked out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to the mainstream media. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought that when I
saw the bath water thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I already thought that was ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, even before that,
there was those places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that were selling, you
ever see those like places </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that were selling cans filled with air? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Like the, this is a
can filled with Hawaiian air. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> How did you get that air? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you just go to
Hawaii? Go like that or? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, just open the jar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Just open the jar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I guess how is that
different from spring water? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Spring water makes more sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can understand why someone
might make an argument. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't give a fuck. I'll drink. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll put my mouth over the whole tap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get the full essence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want the lime scale of norm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I guess some people are
picky. They don't want it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but normally the whole bottled
water is just like tap water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They just add like a bunch of
minerals. Yeah. Just add shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, you mean minerals? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean minerals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Elements. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Elements. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean elements. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not incorrect. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Two shots of lead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's like beauty products. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where beauty products, like
they market the story to you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> as like, oh, we got this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We got this product from the
mountains of the Himalayas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where the only freshest tree
grows or something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's just someone
in a lab that made it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they put, they stuck
a label on it. It's-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Pretty much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's no different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I haven't done it up my
research on where spring, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where bottled war actually comes from. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you care? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I don't care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That was a very, noest of nos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like men, I'm like I will say-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can not dismiss
that argument any faster. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you care? No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just wanna know.
Did you actually care? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Before go down this argument
and start talking about this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I Don't care. I'm like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I saw those documentaries
where it's like Nestle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where they just go into like
towns of America and just take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all their drinking water
and then just sell it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as bottled water. 'cause they
add ,I don't know, like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - A label to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They add like a one, zero milligram </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of chlorine or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they're like,
now it's treated water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's no longer tap water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. But wasn't like a
massive controversy in England </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> at least was the fact that Dasani. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So Dasani is still in America.
If I remember correctly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Dasani still in America, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the reason Dasani is
not sold in England anymore </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is 'cause there was
this massive controversy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where Dasani marketed it
as fresh spring water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it got found out that
they were just selling bottled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tap water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the tap was coming from
a spring or something anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. But obviously the
people in the UK are very, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how to explain it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Stuff like that really
piss British people off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> The fact that you would
try and sell us something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is just so basic is
something so much more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just wondering if it's spring water, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's connected to a
tap and that spring water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is coming out of a tap. Is it spring water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or is it tap water? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a spring, tap water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just taped spring water.
It's whatever you want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've entered the water matter. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm gonna bring you a step
deeper in the water matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So onsen culture in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Are you gonna tell me that
every single onsen water, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is every single onsen we go
to just fresh from the earth </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or is it just like, where
does that water come from? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's from the ground,
but it's through a tap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah it's through a tap. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So is it hot springs-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why are you bringing this up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or is it just tap water? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you just taking a bath in tap water </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like everyone else? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, Joey, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because tap water has
to come from somewhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A spring perhaps. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think tap water
implies that it's the grid, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the national system. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Not the thing you're
taking onset bath guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I see some onsens
have the water get delivered </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to them by trucks. Not tap water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They get it delivered by trucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think, well, is
it like, I don't know-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The onset is, from what
I understand is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the stuff in the
water, like the minerals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from whatever they dig out of the-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So there's a clear
difference between an onsen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and a cental, which is a bathhouse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A cental is just hot water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no minerals in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't have like any of like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> natural stuff that makes it healthier. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then an onsen is the
stuff that is mineralized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> from the ground, like onsen water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think most people just assume that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, bathhouse equals
onsen, which it doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's two different things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I do notice,
depending on the onsen we go to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the water is very different
depending on where you go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. There's like 30 different types </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sort of ridiculous onsens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's all just different makeup, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the acid one, I went
with Chris into an acid onsen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then obviously-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The one we went to last week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. We went to one last week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was very lovely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We could talk about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a, that's a good segue. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Amazing segue, Joey. Thank you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - To talk about the fact
that we just went on holiday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> On a ski trip, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which we've revealed is
not going to be a special. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Unfortunately we do like
to hang out with each other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and not always have to pressure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We hang out outside of content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Outside of, even though Joey made-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Made a long matter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which may or may not be out by now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but they'll probably be out by now. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But we went to, where
did we go again, Isekoi? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isekai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isekai that's a Mongo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a Mongo. I completely
just, Isekai, that's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Isekai, Yeah in Hokkaido. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hokkaido. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the, one of the
most famously resort in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Probably like top two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it the most famous? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Ohakabank and Isekai, the two famous ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're two big boys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's Zao in Yamagata. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's not that famous though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Zao is famous in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've also been there and
is like very, very old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It's not as great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every ski lift is like a plank. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It just like took you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hand cranked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would say that this is
my first proper ski trip </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because unlike before
I only went for a day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I was out of commission
for like every other day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I had like day of snowboarding
this time I had basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like four days of snowboarding, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> two like full hard days and
two like kind of like softer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> take it easy days, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but still four days of
snowboarding and yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it was a lot of fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But my God did my body
hurt the day after. Holy-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did your mom ask you how
the white person sport was? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that what she asked you
last time or something? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, she asked me last time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - How are the white people there? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I will say it was so weird
going into that skier zone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Just going to that town and
just seeing more people speaking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> English than they were Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I heard less Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I heard more Chinese and
English that I did Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's only gonna increase
once the borders open up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah. Because like
every single staff member, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not just in the hotel we stayed at, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but just in town for
some reason spoke English </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there are a lot of Aussies there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of Aussies. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And if they and speaking English, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then they were basically
speaking Mandarin or Cantonese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you had the very few
people just speaking Japanese, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the Japanese people were
literally in the minority. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> From what I could see and
the country's closed off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So how bad is it gonna be when
the country actually opens up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and tourism comes back in? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I remember
when I worked in HakoBA, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is the other famous
one in Niigata that is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like almost 99%-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nagano, you mean, Sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sorry. Nagano, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sorry. It's like 99% Australians. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's actually scary. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I remember some days being there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like going around to like
restaurants and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I would step outside after
restaurant and I'd be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah, I'm in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause when you're inside the restaurant, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's Australian. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So it feels like I'm
back home in Australia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Feels like every country
has their national pests. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Australia has the cane
toads, Japan has Australians. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Japan has Australians. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Localized in the ski resorts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just go. And you're
like, oh yes I can see you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So when you're at home-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. 'cause yeah, it
was super surreal for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being in a place which
was very clearly Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but all the signs were in English. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The menus were in English
and all the staff members </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spoke English as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was weird, man. It was weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I tried my best speak
Japanese to like anyone I met, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever I went to a cashier
or something and anytime I did, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they would just always reply
back in perfect English. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's funny. 'Cause when
I was booking the hotel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I booked the hotel for
Zoe, but I booked it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I asked like for like a
shuttle service to pick us up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's like two
hours, two hours and a half </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from the airport. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - From the airport. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was like, well, booking.com says </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they have a shuttle service,
I was like, oh great, great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So I clicked it two days
before they messaged me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, by the way, we
don't have a shuttle service. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I like, like what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What do you mean you don't
have a shuttle service? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like, we don't, but
we can help you get one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just go to these links and get the bus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I go and look for the bus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's no seats left on the bus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, oh, what do we do?
He's like call up the hotel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I remember, so this
is where I talked the guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like oh, is
English okay? In Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, in English
he goes, "Oh thank God." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was like, "Yeah, that's
great. That's perfect." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Yeah, I don't
really like speaking Japanese." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Oh great. All right." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's from the Philippines or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, all right, sick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was like super chill.
He was like, "Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "We'll get you a taxi
mate. You'll be alright." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Very expensive taxi. Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You fucked up. We didn't book beforehand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like normal people. 'Cause we
booked the trip pretty late </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> as well. Right? Like two weeks before? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It was something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like quite expensive,
but it was good though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was smack bang in the
middle of the season as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's probably like the
most amount of people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I will say this was like
probably the coldest weather </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've consistently been in because
throughout my entire life, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the coldest weather I've
really had to deal with is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like minus five, minus six. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh God. Oh God. How did you manage? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Huh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did you manage? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> In my mind when you guys
were telling me to pack </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> winter clothes, pack
all these different kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of thermal gear and everything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, it's cold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I get it. I know it's going to be cold. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Nothing in my mind could process
really just how cold it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up there and just how cold
it feels. Cause to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it gets to minus five
and anything below minus five, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, it's cold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, that's I know , it is cold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's how my mind processes it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But my body wasn't prepared
for just the different types </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of coldness because it
just never had experienced </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> At least not to such a big degree </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I've been in Wisconsin in winter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it gets cold in there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but we just stay inside all the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're not out there
snowboarding skiing and all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So point in perspective, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think every day on Ridge
was like minus like 10 or 11. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was yeah. It was minus
like 16 at the top as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. It was minus 16. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At night it shot down even lower. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. 'Cause you'd wear like this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what you call
it. Not a battle Claver, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like just like a cloth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a face mask. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it's like a piece of cloth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that you put underneath your mask </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that blocks here so that
you freeze your face off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But one of the days it was so cold </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that after one run of going down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like one of the things I tried to touch it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was rock solid. It was frozen over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was crazy. It was so cool though, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was such a cool ski resort. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was, I guess, being in
that kind of cold weather </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or being in that kind of cold place, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of put things into
perspective for me with, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you are ill-equipped just
to go outside for a quick walk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something. You'll probably die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I guess I've never
been in an environment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I've needed to worry
about just having basic gear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to protect myself from the weather. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Otherwise my life would be in danger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it gets cold, but it's bearable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it gets cold, but
just run to nearest combining </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or just run to nearest
tescos and just warm up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You run a bit more, but like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The nearest combining
was like 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
'Cause there was nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember when we
arrived to the hotel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we got greeted by the receptionist
and everything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And he said, oh, you know,
if you want to go into town, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make sure you book a taxi
because if you don't book a taxi, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every taxi's going to
stop at about midnight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they've had some people
that have gone into town, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is a bit further
away from the ski resorts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and had no way to get
back in like -10 weather. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a 20 minute drive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a 20 minute drive. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a two hour walk in-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The ski resort has a bunch
of different areas around it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It has a lot of mountains. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> We went to this village called Hirafu, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which is technically on
the next mountain over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And that just puts in a
perspective how far away that is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it just made me think, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If we just forgot to call a taxi one day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we'd just be fucked because
nowhere would be open. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We couldn't get home and we
just have to like survive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> outside in the wilderness in
-10 degree weather Celsius, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by the way, Celsius. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Went to that one bar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And was he Australian or south African? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it was Australian. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, he was Dutch, I believe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was he really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think his accent-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was he Dutch? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - His accent sounded Dutch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought he had a nosy accent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This guy was just like, he
was just like, we were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what do we do if we missed the cabs? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would know if he was Aussie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He definitely wasn't
Aussie. He was European. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We asked him, what do we
do if we missed the cabs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the guy's like, ah, just walk come. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no. He said, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He was like, where are you staying? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like at the, at
XYZ hotel and he's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's walkable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I looked at him with Google
maps it was like, walking-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - An hour and 40 minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - An hour and 40 minutes. I'm
like, it's certainly walkable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Would I do it though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In -15 degree weather
is a different question. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, walk walkable is a technicality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can. Yeah. I'm sure
human would be able to walk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from one end to the other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, Hokkaid to Tokyo is walkable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you can walk it if you would want to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean the south pole is walkable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> People have done it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you're Jesus, you can walk anywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Pacific is all (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's all walkable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I have legs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's all about drive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - My God. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> - Thank to Princess Connect
for sponsoring this episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back to the show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is so nice though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is so good. we had like a
really nice onsen in the hotel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It was one of the
best onsens I've been in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Being cold all day and
then just going in the onsen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and the onsen was outside as
well. Yeah, it was so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you kind of put
yourself in the water, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe up to your chest or
the bottom of your shoulders, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you get this perfect blend
of like your bottom half </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is nice and warm and toasty
in this mineral water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then your top is
just getting covered-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Such is anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's it's so anime, especially
going in an onsen is anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Going in an onsen in snow
is just like, this is-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anime a air. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's pretty anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause you are literally sitting there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you see the anime steam,
where you see the steam </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where there are sensors, everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's literally what it was like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. You couldn't see anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like there was just so much steam. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You couldn't see anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. So it's just
like a real life sensor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so this view we had
of just the snow as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it looked so aesthetic.
It was just unfair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It looked like a wallpaper. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It looks like unreal engine fire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It literally looked like
an unreal engine test. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a rendering of not real life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It looks so good that
it looks unrealistic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the only part I
regret not being able to walk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that was probably
like the most aesthetic part. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can't take a camera there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't take a camera. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was good. Oh gosh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, fucking dicks out boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. 'Cause it was
so cold on top there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> as you were just staring at the landscape, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your hair would freeze. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So like our hair was frozen
solid while our bottom halves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> were like nice, nice and toasted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it was so weird
because even though your hair </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is frozen and your shoulders
and head are just covered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in snow, you're not cold </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you're sitting
in boiling hot water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. You're
sitting in boiling hot water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it's like this
perfect, weird balance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know what
minerals they had going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in that bath, but like every
day I felt like silky smooth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I felt amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It was probably just salty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like baby wash. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whatever that mineral was-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't drink it, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know I don't drink it.
I didn't mean to drink it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt gets in the onsen and
he's like, yeah, it's kinda. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I gotta coat my stomach. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. He's like the
ice cream testing guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a ten. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's like, chocolate, out of four. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes a bit of
bath water just slips in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I sound like Mailin now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you guys never
licked bath water before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't get near the bath water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't like how you
used the word slipped in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that implies it's going somewhere else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes you just like
watch your face or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you just get a quick taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't wash your
face with the onsen water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, so sometimes like my
face was like freezing cold. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I needed to warm it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. No. That's what
the towel's for, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well you get the water
on the towel as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How was your snowboarding gone? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> How did-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you think you improved a lot? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did think I improved a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think Garnt improved. Definitely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I definitely, my
confidence went way up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from day one to day four. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Having said that, I think I
learned the most on day four. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because day one, two, and
three, I had one goal, survive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're talking halo music starts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Objective, survive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, because you go
down some of these slopes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was having a chat with Connor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about there are like green slopes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there are like red slopes, and
there are like black slopes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But at the end of the
day, it's just a label. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> God's not there creating mountains, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being like I'm going to
make this a green slope </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and exactly these the
same angles throughout. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the map maker is like, "Yes my Lord, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'll write that down." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's just like playing
like SimCity with the earth </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever, God's not doing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You get what you're
given with the mountains </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and not every mountain
and not every slope. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Even if it's labeled a green slope, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are different variations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> There are different variables. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some of the red slopes
are actually easier </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than the greens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would say. So I would say so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. So if you're not
familiar with snow sports at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the slopes normally categorized
in colors or diamonds, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wherever you're from-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shapes. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Normally it's green is easiest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then some also use blue in Europe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Australia also has blues, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So in Europe you sometimes see green. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You sometimes don't it depends
on which country you're in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But is normally blue, red, black, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and in America you have black diamond. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> China also uses black diamond as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It's red circle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sorry. Green circle. Red
square. Black diamond. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not that far. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. 'Cause in Japan, there's like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Green square, black
circle, green circle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Green circle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause cause normally the
biggest variation of difficulty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comes in black slopes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. 'Cause they're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> some of them are literally just like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're not treated at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Some of them are just awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And so that's why there's even
a, normally a bigger scale. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But in Europe it's just all black. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, it's all hot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. You've been skiing blue. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So on the first day we
just stayed on literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the baby beginner slope.
It was literally like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt did, I didn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Me and Garnt did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it was like the warmup slope. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Me, Joey, and Luke
stayed on the beginner slope, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the baby park slope of this ski resort. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the next day we're like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we we're feeling confident now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're feeling confident to
actually take the gongler up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the top of the mountain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and ski down the green slopes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So there was like no distinction for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from what was the green slope
and what was a red slope. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We actually followed
Connor and we accidentally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> took a red slope. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't tell the difference at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was exactly the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because they were just
like me, fine for my life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to go down the tiniest little slope. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's that like, I
couldn't tell the difference </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between a few degrees. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not to mention, the
weather that day was so shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The visibility was like five meters, if-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. So this resort
had a beginner slope </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and when I say beginner slope, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the most beginner
slope I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It is literally like a
flat surface that sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> goes to a 1%. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a one or 2%. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So really, amazing if you're
actually beginners beginner-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which Luke was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Like, so with a
friend who came with us, Luke, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who had never skied in his life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was a good start. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think he got confident on that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. He did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was like, "Oh, I've
only fallen over once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I can go at the top now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And so if you wanted
to go do any other slopes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that were kind of difficult, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we had to go all the way to the top. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's where it kind of gets, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't really have a choice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if some of the difficult or not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But the day before we went up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we went up the day before and it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the visibility was awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You could maybe see like
five meters ahead of you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we go pretty fast
and it's like, just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just hoping I don't find
someone. Cause if I do, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna hit someone
and it's like, oh God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh God. It was really sketchy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It really bad. And then-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But even the second day,
the visibility was quite shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah. So the
first day was a lot worse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I literally couldn't, maybe I
couldn't see at that camera. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh. Wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe, no, no. Maybe
Ashley, where Ashley is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That was about where
it starts to get blur. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I couldn't see anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the next day was, it was still bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But not as bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So we went with another friend, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Ohara's a YouTuber who lives
here and then we were, he's-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And Chris as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. And Chris too,
Chris as well. All right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So to give you a gauge
of the skill levels, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess, what would you put yourself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where would you put yourself? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I Would say it's Ohara,
you, Chris, me, Garnt, Luke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I've no issue doing
black slopes or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So me and Ohara cause we were
like the most confident ones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> we were like, all right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, you go in the front, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you like direct them
and I'll go in the back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'll, if they fall over,
I'll help them get back up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Luckily I'm glad I was there
'cause Luke at one point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lost his ski in like really thick snow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And when you're in ski boots, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can't really go up the mountain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're not used to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you're like a
beginner, it's really hard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to feel confident running
around in the ski boots. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was wearing snowboard
boots. So I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "All right, just wait there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'll go and dig through the snow." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And after like five minutes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I managed to find this
ski buried in the snow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It'd gone underneath the snow
slid. So you couldn't even, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there was no sign that
it was ship was there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I had to like rummage through
yeah. Eventually found it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we went down anyway, but like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so we took these guys up
and it was just a mess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause like none of them
could like stand up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Chris is good at skiing,
but Chris is lazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I did notice that. I did notice that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Chris, Ken, and I reckon
Chris could probably do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a black slope, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe. If Chris really tried. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Problem is black slopes are really tiring </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and take a lot of effort. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Chris doesn't wanna do that.
Like Chris also is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he'll do reds, but you
really have to convince him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're supposed to do greens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like Chris, you
could do reds so easily. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What are you doing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Because I remember
like the third or fourth day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he came with me, Garnt,
and Luke on a green slope </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause that's when we started
to get a little more confident </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he was like, "Yeah, I think
I'll stick on a green too." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck off here, get outta here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you passed the exam go away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he's like skiing past
us with no problem whatsoever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, "Come on,
boys, catch up boys." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like fuck off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause yeah. So, the second
day we tried to take them down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> How long did it take us to get to them? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay. So if I went from top
to bottom without stopping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I went as fast as I could, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I could probably do it
in five minutes. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's like didn't
do initially fast-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it probably took
us 30 to 45 Minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it took us like second hour. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It took like the two hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - The first time at least. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh. The first time, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Because after it I swear we
spent like 15 to 20 minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looking for, well you were
looking for Luke's skis. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then before that as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because this was right at the start. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the visibility was so poor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I probably would have
a hard time seeing Joey </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from where he is sitting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's how poor the visibility was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this was also
basically my only my second </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> four-day skiing. So snowboarding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I didn't know how to
properly control my board. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember we were trying
to stick close to a group. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We were trying to stick close
to a group and I'm trying like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm fighting for life. Just
like see where the group was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so before every hill,
we all stop before a hill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Unfortunately my control of
the board was not good enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I knew how to stop yet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So these guys were stopped
waiting for me and Luke. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I come along and I
try to stop and I realized </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I am stopping too late
and I'm sliding down the slope. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I start shouting out, "Oh
guys, oh, I'm going down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm just gonna go ahead." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And nobody looked back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just start stumbling down
this hill, get halfway down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I turn around to see
if anyone's followed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wait a minute, wait two
minutes, wait five minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's there's nobody. And I'm
just like, where is everybody? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I am on this slope at the top
of this mountain by myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I can't even stop
correctly. So I had to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like messaging the lion group, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to get their attention. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Luckily, I waited long enough
for you guys to come down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause these guys were waiting
for me this entire time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. They thought
that Garnt was behind us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's how poor the visibility was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So yeah, we wait just 20 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you were waiting
for me and I was waiting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for you just because we
couldn't see each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I was really worried </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause the way that this
mountain was laid out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that basically you
have to do really big Ss </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to stay on the easy ones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if they took any turn at any point, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they have to go down a black slope. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just a cliff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was like, they're gonna die </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if they go down a black slope. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, I gotta
do my best to make sure, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we got I'm like, like what
are they, what are they, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what are the sheep dogs like
turn around up all the sheep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, come on, boys,
let's stick together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It was kind of like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So which is why I think I
learned the most on the last day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because on the last day we
just found like this one slope </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was perfect for beginners
and had like a ski lift, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> take us back up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And you just had like the
freedom to just do what you want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without worry about dying
or just breaking bones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also the weather was
absolutely gorgeous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] And the weather was like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. So we had three
days of God, awful weather. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Really bad weather. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And finally the last day we
were leaving, it was amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was a shame really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause the next few days after
that were also really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we kind of booked it the wrong time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was amazing
weather, really good stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the last day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm really, really impressed
that nobody got injured. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause there's six of us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, did you guys take
any bad tumbles during-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- the ski trip? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I let's just say I'm really
glad I rented outta a helmet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I think about 80%
of my falls involved me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just my head, just getting whiplash back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you like kill a toddler Garnt? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I almost did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because like on the first
like two, three days, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know how to stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So my technique for stopping
involved falling over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and if I didn't fall over, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would just basically just take out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whoever like was in front of me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's this great photo that
Luke took of you just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's this kid right here
and then there's just Garnt, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> menacingly behind me. Like
I'm about to destroy you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Move out of the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I must have decked
at least like three kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on the display from like
the past three days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God, Garnt the kid killer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thank God no one got injured
except for those three kids. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - None of us got injured. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it was like a
competition because me and Luke </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just kept crashing into each
other on the first two days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause we had zero control. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We didn't know how to control our boards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember Luke decked Joey, once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Luke legs kicked me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had a great POV of this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like leading everyone
down the right slopes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I was waiting for
them bottom and I saw Joey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just slowly like going down like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then out of nowhere, RKO, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just see our friend Luke
who doesn't know how to stop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's coming, coming and I
see Jerry. So, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm about getting my popcorn
now waiting for this to happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey's going, Joey's going,
doesn't move his head at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then suddenly he just goes, boom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Right in the back of his legs.
And Joey just flips over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that was so funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because all I heard 'cause
I was slowly going down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was kind of a narrow stretch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And also I was waiting for Luke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was slow going down
'cause I saw you guys there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember specifically behind me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I could hear Luke in the distance going, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just getting louder
and louder and louder. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But I thought he was
saying that to other people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that were behind me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was like, oh Luke, silly him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Silly him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It gets louder. Sorry, sorry. Sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then just bam right
in the back of my knees. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let get fully over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I should have been more
concerned, but it was so funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wish you had filmed that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - By the time I realized it was happening, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like five seconds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Couldn't have got my phone
out, but I wish I did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanted to see your POV of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wish I had my GoPro on permanently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was too busy with falling
over myself to really see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what everyone else was falling over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I remember I had a few bad tumbles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where actually some of the worst tumbles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> was when I was just actually
not going the fastest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like, cause when you go
fast, sometimes like you saw, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you guys saw me do have
some pretty big falls </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where I did a triple back
flip or whatever or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But to me, those falls are fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you take the momentum </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you just literally roll with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you hardly feel it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Some of the worst falls I had
was on like the second day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Think I saw this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - These guys were trying to
warn me not to stop myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with my hands. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because sometimes if you have a bad fall, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you stop yourself with your hands, you-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You snap your wrist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you could snap your wrist
or break your or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So they were telling me,
you gotta fall on your arms. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You gotta do this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Make sure you don't try to catch yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You gotta do this. And
like, like this, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I took that as I'm going to do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not realizing the mistake
I was about to encounter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because what happened is I
was taking a bunch of tumbles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, this doesn't hurt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm a pro at falling
over with a snowboard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So this one time I was going
down, this really like this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the slope wasn't steep at all.
I was going pretty slowly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I just catched the
edge and I'm about to fall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> straight to my face. So
I do what they tell me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I tuck my arms in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Unfortunately my fists were
right front of my face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So what happens is I fall on
my arm and I just deck myself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just go, which, and
I remember I fall over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and when you have a bad fall
and you just gotta lay there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just question life for a bit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's when you know it's bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I remember I lay
there for a few seconds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I just hear kind of
going, "All right, Garnt." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I just saw this, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause obviously it looks
like ants in the background. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just saw Garnt just fall on his face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, get back up, Garnt, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> get back up, get back up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he didn't get
up and I'm like, oh no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he hurt himself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was a couple
times on the last day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think where you did that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like triple back flip, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I saw it in the distance and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, that looked like it hurt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then Garnt just didn't
move for about 20 seconds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, oh he's dead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh he's straight up dead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. I ever seen that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I just saw like someone doing like flips </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but not the good type of flips. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I could hear the SSX music playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when that was happening.
It's like, let's drink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You took so many falls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I Did. I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's when I
learned the most though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> when you do take the falls. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not about how many
times you get hit down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's how many times you get back out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's that drive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. It's about the drive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's actually like the most embarrassing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fall I took wasn't even on the slopes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was on the ski lift. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because, well, Joey
was there because me and Joey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were trying to get on
the ski lift together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like two man ski lift. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was a two man ski lift. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So me and Joey line up together. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we are just gonna have a nice chill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right up on the mountain.
And so I look back, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've done the ski lift
for a bunch of times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm not even a beginner anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I like know how to get on the ski lift. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is a lot hard on a
snowboard than a ski is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also I thought, because I just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I'm standing there
waiting for the ski lift </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to come around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I look back and in my
mind I take a mental note </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the momentum of this ski lift. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I know how fast this thing's going. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so right before it gets near us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I turn around thinking it's
gonna have the same momentum, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not thinking that they're
gonna slow it down for us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So what I do is I turn
around and I just sit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that feeling where you
take a step where you think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like a stare and
then there's just not? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I had that feeling where I sit down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I just feel nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, oh no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, I just, I just collapsed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the next thing I
notice is I feel like the bump </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on the back of my helmet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which thank God I was wearing
a helmet at this point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I'm just like, they're
gonna stop the ski lift. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So my instinct is just to
adopt the fetal position </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> while they hopefully stop the ski lift. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Plot twist, they don't stop the ski lift. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so the ski lift just
goes over me and Joey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like Joey, I guess
just snowboards over me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I look up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I look up thinking what has
happened and I just see Joey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just looking back on the
ski lift and being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're right, dick head? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, no, it was, 'cause it was amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm surprised they didn't stop it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They should have stopped it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause how I usually do it
with like skis or snowboards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is I wait for the chair to
physically hit me in the back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the knees. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that's where I know.
Oh it's right underneath. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kinda like bend over. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just get my butt ready. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was doing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was looking back, just waiting, waiting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> waiting, waiting until
it hits me right here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I look over, look up, sit down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking it's all good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I hear like this
horrible scraping sound </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from somewhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, what's what's going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I look over and Garnt is just
down there under the thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like this and I was like,
oh, they're gonna stop it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They don't stop it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It goes right over Garnt. I was like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's cruel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. And finally stop
it after it's gone past you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the woman comes over
being like, "You all right?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, what do you mean you all right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You should have stopped it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why did you check up on him
after you let the chair go? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like watching a
fight with the teachers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like watching the kids,
like when it's over like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> oh you guys are alright? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, I'll wait
for them to throw a few-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Break it up. Break it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they break it up there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But no, that was the
most embarrassing one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause they were just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone was just obviously staring at me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I stopped the entire ski
lift and yeah, that was just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like social anxiety
up through the roof. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I'm like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It happens man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I know it happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The can't see your face. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're completely covered up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Who cares? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Aside from that,
I had a wonderful time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> My body hurt a lot, but it was worth it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just wearing, I'm raring
to go again. Honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's probably like some of
the best snow ever snowboarders </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or skied on my life. It was amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> How's it compared to like
European ski resorts? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I like European ones more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's normally they're normally bigger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way more like options, but I
mean it was the quality of snow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't same. It was so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's powdered snowed like
so two meters and dales on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. So most of the black
slopes weren't like groomed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So we went on one and it
was literally just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - it was like--
- Meters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - on a cloud. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I fell over on one of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it was just too deep
and it was so hard to turn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was really bad cause
I basically just shoveled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a ton of no into my jacket and pants. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh. No.
- Oh. No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I was freezing and
I was like in the cold </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with my hand trying to scoop this out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Mine is 15 trying to get all the snow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause if you just leave it in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it'll just melt and then it'll be wet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's even worse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the worst. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Trying to get it out. I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I had to ski for another hour. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> My ass was completely numb. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I couldn't feel anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was so bad. And when
I got back to the room, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, I can't feel my ass. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's been numb for like a good two hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> If someone could have smacked
my ass I wouldn't have known. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That clip is definitely
gonna be taken out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't feel my ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't feel my ass.
- I can't feel my ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just took such a beating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so numb. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Doing too much riding on the board. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so good though. It was really cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was really good ski. I wanna go back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was fantastic snow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pain in the ass to get to, but good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. I think if I go there again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd probably wanna like go to
Sapora for a bit or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then go there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's what a lot of tourist do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is they're kind of maybe
dedicate like a week or two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for the whole thing, because
it is kind of out of the way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially if you're coming from Tokyo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sapora is a really fun city. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yah, Sapora is great city. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sapora is a really chill city. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like all I wanted to do
on the ski trip was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> get the basics down for my snowboarding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think I managed to do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So now I'm like more confident-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Proud of you, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Thank you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Came along very well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You improved a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But now I'm just ready to
tear it down with the boys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for real hopefully. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And try and keep up with them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The real SSX tricky. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want everyone to get better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So that then Chris feels
obliged to do well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but he has no choice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause no one wants to do greens anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I Mean we accidentally went down a reds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - On our second day like we just said. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Didn't go amazing. But we made it down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Didn't go amazing. But we survived. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the important thing we-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, basically there was
this tiny and little sign </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was like, go this
way if you want to go back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to where you came from on a green. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And if you go down straight, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is like the whole thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's really hard to see this thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it also goes back in on itself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So the slope goes down this way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's a little cutoff
here where it goes down and back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> around and then joins off
to like another mountain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's impossible to see considering--. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the conditions, are really bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Entire thing is white. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The conditions are really bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So just everything just blends in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then I was last
'cause I was making sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone was alright.
And then was like, oh no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the Luke who I was with at the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I'm pretty sure he was last. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He went down the red
and I was like, oh shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Moments before a disaster. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - He just like went down the red. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, and then
I'm like, oh my God, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they've all gone down the green.
And then we're stuck here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like lunchtime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we was already at, it was like 1:30. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, oh, we probably
would be eating by now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like we're fucked 'cause we wanna go meet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> have lunch with them as
well. So how do we get back? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, but then luckily </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> all these idiots went
down the red as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Turns out we all missed it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So we all met up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then this scream was
really annoying as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it was like a
flat, really, really flat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I told the guys, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Guys, you gotta make sure you
get as much speed as you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "on your snowboards. We're
not walking anywhere." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're like, got it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Put snowboards on two seconds
later. Falls on our ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> All right. Taking it off now
I'm walking the whole way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I'm going as fast as I can. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm getting load to the
ground, get aerodynamics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I get over there and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh my God, I made it all right. Nice." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm waiting. I'm like,
they'll come any second now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like 10 minutes later, they
come around the corner walking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, what is this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. To be fair, we
did attempt to snowboard, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to me it wasn't a case
of getting to the end. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> To me it was a case of how far
can I get before I fall over? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I knew once I
fell over, that was it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Momentum was gone. I
gotta take off my boots. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is hard to go fast on the snowboards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Much easier on skis. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. I'm all
self-taught with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I just kind get a
feeling for it I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. Sure. By the
end of the week we all, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think definitely got a feeling for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go fast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Go fast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We were going hell of a
lot fast on the last day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> compared to the first day. That's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like Garnt was, can
blitzing down this mountain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, oh God, he's
about to SSX tricky right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could feel it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Well we had to get
back to like our ski resort </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and they closed the way of getting over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> What would you call
the, what's the bridge? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ski lift-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's the, it's like a pathway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a word for this right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A pathway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, not a pathway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Slalom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a, oh, I forgot the word. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I forgot what it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a word for like an entrance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That is like a, I don't
know. I wish I had it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - An entry way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're literally using
all the words I would use. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So there's a path and
it closes at like 3:30. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, okay. If you
don't go back over as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to get like a
30, 40 minute bus ride. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'd rather kill myself than get a bus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just so depressing when
you got all your ski gear. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you gotta sit on this bus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, oh no, why would I
do that when I can ski back? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So me and Ohara were gonna go back over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we asked the guys
like, "Are you guys coming?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they were like,
"No, we'll get the bus." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it was like kind of tough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We had to ski a bunch
quickly, get on a chairlift, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ski over, then walk over
and then ski back down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It is kind of difficult,
especially if you're tired. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they weren't doing
it. And I was like, no worries. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We'll do it. We'll do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we were going and then right before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we were about to cross it, they called us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were like, "Oh yeah,
actually we we'll do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I think we can do it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, oh shit. It's
like mission impossible now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Gotta get these boys back over safely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Felt like Saving private
Ryan back to the hotel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We gotta get them back over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we had to quickly like rush these guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And we were like, no fall,
like, just go don't don't stop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just be good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Cause they shut it
off at 3:30 for some reason. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's cause at 3:30, the sun sets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you just can't see
anything, especially up there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like even during the day,
the visibility was so bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was pretty bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I definitely
understand why people wore snow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and ski board from this trip though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Especially on the last day
where the visibility was clear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I just kind of realized, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> snowboarding and skiing is
just hiking, but the fun part. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you don't--
- You're going down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. you get like the amazing view, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you don't have to put in the effort </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of getting that amazing view. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Isn't it crazy when you
like you're on the ground </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you look up at the
mountain and you see as steep, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some of these things are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're like, I skied down there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I snowboard down there. It's crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause I remember on the first day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> when we stayed on the beginner slope. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the beginner slope had
this ski lift to take us up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the beginner slope and taking
us up because it was so slow, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It took us like what? 15 minutes I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 10, 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So in my mind I'm like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're going up like half
the mountain. Holy fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I remember on the
second day when Connor was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh yeah, we're gonna go to
the top of the mountain today." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where was the beginner slope? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he points this point,
which is like a 10th of the way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up the mountain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You mean we were this low. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] But the view was so good from-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The view was already
amazing. What's going on? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 10 out of 10 would
recommend skiing to anyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who like me as a kid,
weren't wasn't able to go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And if especially you're from
a Southeast Asian country. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Garnt is a white man. Now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Unfortunately it just happens
to be the most expensive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> vacation sport you can do, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it is good. It is really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You can do budget once. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's plenty of budget
packages that I know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that we used to do when I was like a kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Japan definitely
has those as well, for sure. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> - Did you guys get up to
anything else on your holidays? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> How was your Christmas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Christmas?
- How was your new years? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it was supposed
to be in Australia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, that's exactly why
we went on the ski trip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because of-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that didn't happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like we've been trying to
plan a ski trip for two years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and what it took to take us
to finally plan the ski trip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was a global pandemic to
cancel all our plans once again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be like, well guys,
I know you guys are free </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this weekend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or I know you guys are
finally free this week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's go on a ski trip. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hopefully we'll go on another ski trip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that won't take as much
time or if we plan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Two years later. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Two years later. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. My Christmas
and news was very chill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just spent it with some mates,
played a lot of Mahjong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Played a lot of Mahjong? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I played a lot of Mahjong played. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Played a lot of TFT. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course you did. Of course you did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that your new apex? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I played with
Darius and Emily a bunch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like addicted to it. It's fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fun. I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like NFTs, but you-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can leave. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never understood TFT. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's auto chess. Isn't it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What does that mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. I it's hard to explain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like it doesn't-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Something like the blockchain? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It's not the blockchain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a game that you
can't easily describe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how you describe it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kinda like the blockchain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe if Garnt played it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Garnt's really good at giving
short descriptions to staff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've noticed. I am not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's why it's my job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's literally what I do for my channel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He does that with animations. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not, when I play
this game, it's like, well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a battle
simulation, chess thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You buy units and then you place them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it plays out
on its own the battle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's like tower defense, but chess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it's one battle
and then you lose health </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or health depend on
what happens. And then-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But Tower Defense is kinda like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You buy units and then
it plays automatically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you're playing
against another player. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So he's buying stuff
and you are buying stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're placing them on the board. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you go against each
other and then you have to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you also get like stuff that comes up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you it's like gambling, but like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's re-rolling for more
choices to it's gambling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you call it management? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Gotcha. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is a very board boring
game when you explain it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> extremely so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Director] You have to
exactly play it to actually-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's fun though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You say that about most things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's one of those games again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wouldn't recommend playing it alone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There's, with friends it's great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think with friends it's really fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a lot of way. It's like chill, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's not too intense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you can talk, league
is too intense. I feel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - League, I've tried playing
league with mates before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just that silent guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I'm concentrating
too much on the gameplay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be able to communicate with my friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like have a good time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's great. There's a
lot of downtime in the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where you are not doing
anything so you can just chat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's you can do it very
casually. It's really chill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fun game. Recommend it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. I also have been trying to game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been trying to, can I
sound anymore boomer, but no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been trying to
find a game to get into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> still kind of looking
started Pokemon recently, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the newest Pokemon and the switch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Diamond and Pokemon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The first Pokemon ever, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it your first Pokemon game ever? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not my first Pokemon game ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's my first Pokemon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Since Pokemon Ruby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The original Pokemon Ruby on the-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. When
does Pokemon get good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I forgot to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That means you're playing it wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no. That means
he's not enjoying it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not really enjoying it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll be honest because
I've done the first two, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like gyms now for Pokemon
Diamond. And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember being, huh? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, well that's so far. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To be fair. That's how far I got-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like 10 minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like two hours. Two, three hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Two hours? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is it really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's maybe like an hour. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's a lot of dialogue
you have to sift through. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is a lot of dialogue,
a lot of like 'cause okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Here's the thing. When
you go to a new town, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> do you talk to everyone? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. I talk to everyone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, okay, this-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's a classic JRPG player right there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is me. This is JRP training. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Being like, I have to
talk to everyone and about-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can't miss the items right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - About an hour in I'm just
like, this is really boring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why are you talking to everyone? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every so often they give me an item. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So I must talk to everyone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Otherwise I'm not going
to get all the items. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do they give you? A portion? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Five, 500-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes they give me a super potion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh. - It's like 500 Pokemon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How many super potions do you use? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause your Pokemon's so OP. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's not the point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've like not needed to
change my Pokemon once </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> since my main Pokemon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. I don't know maybe
my experience is different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from my experience as a
childhood, because as a child, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just so easy for me to
immerse myself into a game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is why Pokemon
challenges are so good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and they've gotten, that's why
people love them on YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a way to turn a Pokemon
game into a more challenging </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I suppose adult kind of challenge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's way more fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't play Pokemon Vanilla anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have to make it a chance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's lots of fun. Randomizes are fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I came into this thinking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't played Pokemon
since Pokemon Ruby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can just play this casually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and have kind of the same experience did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as I did as a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't know if I'm just
not far enough into the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yet, but I mean, to me like
two, three hours into a game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like mostly of the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what I give a game
before I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do I stick with this
game and fully commit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or do I try another game? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think you like the game, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe, maybe I don't. Maybe I don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe you should try
Nuzlocke version of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That'd be more fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's Nuzlocke again? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nuzlocke is like PERMA death basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So if you Pokemon fate, you die, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it "dies" and you have to release it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you can only catch
one Pokemon in one area. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's lots of different rules. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's lots of local rules as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You can kind of mix it up with
like different other rules </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But why wouldn't you just,
if your Pokemon's gonna die, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why wouldn't you just
like grind like crazy? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I mean some people do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then there's a
challenge element of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> do I want to grind for 50 hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or do I just wanna like
gamble and go for it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of the time, people
aren't willing to grind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for 20 hours just to secure that Pokemon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's more fun and on
stream it's very good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's very good stream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It sounds like great stream content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That just sounds stressful to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is stressful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nuzlocke is a hell stressful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I saw someone do a one PP challenge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This great name where every Pokemon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're only allowed to use the move once. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - In one battle I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Unless it heals up again, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There's there's some
pretty obscure challenges. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some pretty good ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's the soul link,
which looks really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Especially like where you both
of you do a Nuzlocke together </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like if Joey's Pokemon dies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when we caught it at the same
time, my Pokemon dies too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you think Pokemon should
have a difficulty setting? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think they should just, well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why they haven't
had their own Nuzlocke </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into the game. Just call it
whatever they wanna call it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They'll remove the name
Nuzlocke 'cause it's Pokemon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> They won't give credit to anyone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But I don't know why they
haven't put it in the game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> People do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it's at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's still a children's game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like people are doing
this to their games anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And people are gonna do it.
Why not just add the option? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's not that it's a
children's game, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like surely adding like the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially like a randomizer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Surely that's easy to add. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. It's hell easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just go in the code. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Be like random all and
then it should work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Super easy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know 'cause like for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I never got the Pokemon
conversation before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I just hadn't played
a Pokemon in so long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But now that I've started to play, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, when does this get fun? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> How long do I not need to be on autopilot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for before this gets-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's 'cause you're playing normally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think if you tried a
Nuzlocke on a stream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd enjoy it a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But if I'm not supposed
to play it normally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> as a casual play who
knows zero about Pokemon-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's you're old for that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Am I too old for that, Connor? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You've played too many
games. You know how to game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not even a gamer.
I'm not even a gamer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You've played JRPGs, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I've played. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You still grinding for
like 15 hours to get one sash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something. I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're too good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Clearly, not a JRPG player. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You are too at grinding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But, and Pokemon now actually
doesn't require any grinding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You can just do it. Like
you start Pokemon on stomps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When did that happen? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember in the
original Pokemon as a kid, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I had to like grind the
out of even just first two, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first few gym leaders. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It lets me share that's so broken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> When did they add that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is such like a funny conversation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think they added that
at like X and Y I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it was before that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really black and white. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No black and white. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They didn't have it. I
think it was X and Y. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was always an item, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but it always only gave it to one Pokemon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then now they just, they were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just turn it on for everyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You get experience by
catching Pokemon as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Which was never a thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. You get experience
by catching Pokemon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When you catch a Pokemon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the Pokemon in your party
get experience from you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - As if you defeated it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're just Oprah
Winfreying the experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're just like you getting experience, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you getting the experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's sweet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - As a Gaer gamer, I'm disgusted
by the lack of grinding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need to do in this game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - As a gamer, I'm disgusted
by your Gaer game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have been thinking
to do maybe shiny runs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> or stuff like that where it's
a little more challenging. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A really fun one I did was,
I did a Pokemon Emerald mode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where, and whenever you enter a building, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it teleports you to a
random part of the map. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. I've seen that one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That one was really fun, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but 'cause it was so hard 'cause
you had to route everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on your own. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So if you weren't familiar
with the map of the game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you were just fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - True. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was really fun
though. Because it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it gives on a completely
different challenge to it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it actually becomes like
really entertaining and fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So are all new Pokemon games,
just this easy, unless you-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They all hold your hand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - artificially add
difficulty to your own run. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd say ever since
Black and White or X and Y </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is where it's really started
to like hold your hand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I understand gamers now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought you guys were being babies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> complaining about this stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. It actually holds
your hand now it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially if you've played Pokemon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> ever since the beginning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I go from that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is to like, if you catch a Pokemon, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you need to commit to leveling it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh. Dude. Like kids, if
I wanna give a kid today </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who grew up on like sword and shield. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or like the new remains give
them like the original blue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like red and be like play
this game and just watch them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have a mental breakdown
of how difficult it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to what they get today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you see the, what was it called. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I totally forgot now. Sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No. Cause I remember
as a kid, I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> some things just felt rewarding
that I don't feel rewarded </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with this game. For example,
when you level up your Pokemon, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every Pokemon just
levels up automatically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like an auto leveler. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was the Pokemon
Let's Go EV and Pikachu. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They gave your starter
Pokemon like increased stance. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The EV or Pikachu and
it had its special move. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It just one shot everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So they gave you the starter
that could just one shot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now, the most bullshit part about EV, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've really enjoyed EV to be fair, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but the most part about EV
was I did an EV only run </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on stream ones because it's just so easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But in some of the Pokemons, you go to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there's just this dude. Who's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I can teach your EV any move of any type. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - For free. Which one would you like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like fire move. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like really
powerful moves as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's like, what's the catch? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, no catch
it's because you talk to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, Oh good. And I
think I did the EV only run </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like four hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like one of the easiest games ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I only did it because I like EV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was it after Pokemon Ruby
that everything started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to just get easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the original Diamond and Pearl </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was still like in that
same difficulty range. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think, I reckon it was
around like X and Y six gen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where they introduced the
whole experience sharing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the really holding your hand element </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause Sun and Moon was
just so ridiculously easy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the same was Sword and Shield as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then every other remake since then, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just been like baby mode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember when I
was a kid in the games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this is like boomer. I
remember I was back in my day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every game was just impossible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But now we've gone too far. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember crying, trying
to beat the first stage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of Mega Man 2. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I ride a game one Game Boy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It was damnations 101, hardest
game ever played in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Disney games like Game
Boy advance was so hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not even Game Boy
advance, like Game Boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh game boy game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This shit was impossible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even know what the I was doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> This is how games were back
then. Like I didn't even, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't even tell you the objective. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just have to go around and figure out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what kills you? I
don't know what is going on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't receive quality
feel once in that game, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just going around this thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like a construction site. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was one of the dogs
and I was like, what is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember like
accordions were killing me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what is this game? I
just don't understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Back then they used to just put you in-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it one of those
unlicensed, Disney games or? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no. It was an actual license. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is back when licensed
games were just put a platform </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just make it impossible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was back then where I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> take the IP, put it
into the Mario universe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Change the design a little
bit. You have a game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So that's what the Mick Mouse game was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The one that I scammed
to my friend, basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like Stu it was basically
just a Mario platformer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was stupidly hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I should remember I
had this like PS 1 game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was a Shrek game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a Shrek picnic game or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm sure Shrek enthusiast
can inform me about this game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember the whole point
of this game was to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you were assembling, I
could be describing this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> completely correctly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the parts to your picnic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you had to go and
like beat bosses and shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like nothing worked
in the game, I remembered. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have to look this up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. Can we give Shrek-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It doesn't sound like a real game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shrek a PS 1 games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Google it right there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let's go Shrek. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just remember it's like
a FIFA Dream this game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the polygons were so-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A Shrek Treasure Hunt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's it, That's it. This game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember I played this game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was like one
polygon in this whole game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That looks like asked, what is that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna, what is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> There's three. I actually
has good ratings. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's 78% like this video game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's the synopsis? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Could we read the synopsis at this case? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shrek Treasure Hunt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Gameplay. Oh, plot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> As Shrek is preparing a picnic with Fiona, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the three blind Mike, steal,
all the picnic equipment, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> such as foods and drinks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So Shrek must go on an
adventure doing mini games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get the items back
before Fiona arrives. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I remember it was like
a bunch of mini games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And these mini games,
just were all broken, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they didn't work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love games with these kinds of plots </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you can just
imagine it just being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fiona have to go get-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember the camera was unusable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and it kept breaking my PS one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And then eventually it just broke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was so close to
the end of this game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was distraught. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's the last picnic item? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I couldn't believe it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember you have to go to
like some castle or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to fight these mice or
some nonsense like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was just, I so angry
that I couldn't finish it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have to find that and play it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You gotta play it, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It sounds amazing. It's a great game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You just stream it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess I should. Maybe I'll
stream it if you want me to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna see it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I actually have a game
recommendation though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I found, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It is a JLBG though. It
is called 13 Sentinels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've heard of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you heard of that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I found this by like complete accident. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I'm just like trying to
look through my game library </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like games. That sound interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just kind of downloaded it on a whim </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I'm just like
anime game. Brilliant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not Pokemon anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I say that Pokemon's an anime game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not typically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But yeah, I download it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it is got a really
interesting concept. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So how I can best describe this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like if you take Bokurano </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and mix that with Steins;Gate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the reason it's called 13 sentinels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is because you have, basically
you have 13 main characters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so the way this story
unfolds is that you are able to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> select a perspective of
part of this main character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the basis of this is at
some point in the future, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Kaiju come along and try
to destroy the world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so these 13 kids
have to save the world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from this Kajiu attack. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I think they fail or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So time travel exists. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you're watching, you're
playing this perspective, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this game from like 13
different perspectives. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And these perspectives jump
between timelines and universes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> depending on who you choose and
whose perspective you're on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you think this will
be a complete mess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like how can you tell a coherent
story when you can choose </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> between 30 different perspectives? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, how the game works is
that you can only progress </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to a certain amount of point
in one person's per perspective </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before you have to play
another person's perspective. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So one person's story route
is unlocked by playing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a certain part of another
person's story route. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the way you get delivered, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the story is like little by
little and you get to piece </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> together what has happened
between this entire timeline. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's actually like insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember my Twitch chat,
telling me all about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> being like, you'd love this game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Does it have good ratings? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It does have good ratings.
That's kind of why I-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Aegis Rim 13 Sentinels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it's an Atlas game. Of
course. That's why it's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 94% Percent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - So the gameplay is kind of
like a turn base strategy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the best way I can describe is like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It looks gorgeous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That looks cute. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It looks really cute. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It is a very
Atlas game, I realized, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's basically a
mix between a visual novel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but with gameplay elements
to break up the story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of that visual novel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Switch versions coming
out in April this year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ooh. Okay. But I highly recommend that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That was just something
I played on the whim </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like I said, I give
everything like two hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or something to try and grab me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And this one like grabbed me immediately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It has a very original storytelling method </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm about halfway through. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And like they use like some
of the twists and turns </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen in the story are insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Atlas, don't miss man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You really don't miss. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Except that new Catherine
game, that was shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know more about the
memes of the Catherine game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than actual people that have
played the Catherine game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I played the new Catherine
game and it was not that good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it's weird. 'Cause
like a lot of this games just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hear more about the Japanese
side talking about it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but like I hardly ever hear
anyone in the Western hemisphere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talking about it unless it's persona. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's 'cause that's basically-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know Western hemisphere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or the Western. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Western world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Western. I don't know why
I said hemisphere there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is Japan in the Western hemisphere? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Technically, anywhere
can be western hemisphere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Depending on where you want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I Kinda realize that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel it's because in the
west it's a very core fan base </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for Atlas games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because they are like
the JRPG players, J RPG. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know people who are like,
anime game, no thank you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They take long-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you. Rightfully so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. They take one, look
at the visuals or the concept </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Nope, I'd rather play bang, bang, bang. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like this man for instance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I understand. There's a
certain kind of expectation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that comes with anime
games. That in my experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is always the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You always get that same feeling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Even if the stories are different, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the game plays different,
something about it just always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> comes off as the same in
my mind. I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't fault people that
are thinking that though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what I like about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's consistency. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't fault people
for thinking that though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because that's exactly how I
feel with a lot of FBS games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where it's like, the concept is different, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but at the end of the day,
it's still bang, bang, bang. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - RPGs for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well like even like Western driven </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> story driven games as well.
It's just like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess it's a same reason why
I'm into anime versus movies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and TV shows where, I will
always watch a movie and TV show, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but those aren't the core
pieces of entertainment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I like. For example, I
remember playing The Last of Us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's a great game, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but I just have like zero
emotional attachment to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I play it and I can
like objectively view-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it because they are not anime? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If they were more anime,
you'd be like, I care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know why it was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the way Western
storytelling works is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's got different tropes
and different method </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of storytelling. But I don't
know of why I gravitate more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to like the anime style of storytelling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I do think they
do have a different style. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Definitely, definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Most different cultures. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Different cultures
and everything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the way Joel and Ellie
were written as characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were great characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just didn't emotionally
attach myself to either </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of those characters, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though I could tell that
they were great characters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why do you emotionally
touch yourself more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to anime characters then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause he's a whim. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, there's gonna be a reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> What about the way that
they did do their characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is more appealing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's because
they're unrealistic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was gonna say, 'cause
that's what bothers me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like the fact that
with anime characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like a clear distinction </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> between reality and fantasy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I like having that
easy separation in my mind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you can have great
really well written anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> characters that are still
clearly like really unrealistic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like just take any
Cinderella, for example, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can have great written Cinderella, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you meet a real real life Cinderella, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just gonna think
that they're a bitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And why are they doing
domestic violence on their farm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or whatever, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you think that the
authors who are writing these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are intentionally making
unrealistic characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or they're intending
to do real characters, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it just comes off
as unrealistic to us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's all based on just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not only the cultural understanding
and norm of that author, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's also the fact
that a lot of these authors </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are also hashing off
other Japanese creations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and other Japanese characters. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I don't really know of many
or any like Japanese author </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who takes direct influence
from like Western stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> for instance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like the only one I can
think of is like Iraqi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is why his
characters are so different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> compared to the traditional norm, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like manga animated,
character style of character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not just visually, but
also as a characteristic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of that particular person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why is like so many
animes set in high school? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is that like, is
that a cultural thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It's a cultural thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why, why so? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's because it's, for a lot of people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like high school is kind of
seen as like this basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like golden time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's depressing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like for a lot of
people, high school is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the whole thing of like in
the west of like high school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is usually movies that are
based in high school in the west </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are based off bad memories. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Being like, oh man, my high
school sucked, blah, blah, blah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There were all these people,
the jocks, the bullies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> blah, blah, blah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the norm in the west, in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's glorified because to a lot of people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> high school was really fun time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with friends they'll never get back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and because it's also the
last years of that person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being young and free. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I liked high
school, but I wouldn't say-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I liked high school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think as well, in terms
of like a storytelling, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like standpoint as well, I
feel like kids in high school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or kids going through
puberty is just already </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a really interesting character dynamic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can get characters to
get away with a lot of shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just because they're in puberty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. But I feel like
there are so many shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so many anime where
you look at the characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and they could be in any setting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause some of the shit
that these high schoolers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go through, they go
through two world wars. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like fighting
Avengers level threats </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they've reached the 13 years old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's totally not a
well written character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not clearly just
an author of being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like high school settings. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let's put them in a high school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but don't actually take full
advantage of it, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But there's a lot of authors
that take full advantage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the high school characters
and that whole setting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and actually work it into
their characters and story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Mind you, that's the
minority. In my opinion, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of them are just like
high school, realistic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> relatable with audience. Am I right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Let's throw them in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I watched Aggretsuko the
new season. That was good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was very refreshing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Depressing is your always. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Depressing is far. Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is great to see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's like one of
the only anime out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that will actually like
commentate on adult life in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and be realistic about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it also says a lot when it,
no one knows about in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is that true? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is absolutely unknown in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh. Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like it is not popular at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Probably because it's too real. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's been in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's literal real in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Very Japanese things in it as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so Japanese, but
it's such a good take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> on the Japanese work life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It's awesome. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - How awful is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it's ironic that this is coming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from the same company
that made Hello Kitty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just to put it into perspective,
how deep they're going. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So in Japan they have a thing
called say shine, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is like an employee for life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can never fire this employee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They have to do something
like really fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well they have to leave
on their own accord. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like even the only
way they can get fired </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is if they actually do
something like illegal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The only way they
can leave the company-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You cannot be fired. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is by going to jail. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You could literally do the
shittiest job on earth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you could like not turn
up and you cannot be fired. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So in Japan obviously,
'cause they decided-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Talk about job security. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So obviously if you told that to anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in any Western country, they'd be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think that sounds like a good idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's not, let's just be honest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Obviously job security
is good and that's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's a terrible idea for any business, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You need to be able to
get rid of employees. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But obviously in the west it's a little, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> especially in some places
they're a little too happy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to fire employees. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So here has to be a balance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a balance, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a whole arc or like
story in the new season. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I won't spoil who it is or what it is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but there's a character who,
because they can't fire him, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they just relocate him to some shit hole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and don't give him any work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they basically just like
morally make him want to quit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're , and it's a whole
thing and it's really dark. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the only way
that SA Shane can quit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. So that-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Basically just pressure them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They bully you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They bully you to quitting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So there's a whole thing where
they just make him fuck off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and like make him, you know,
cause obviously people are, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people wanna be valued when they do work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if you are just not doing anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're gonna be like, why am I here? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Obviously if I was there,
I'd be like, fantastic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can catch up-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fantastic. Let's just play Apex. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why it works in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't, I'm like you telling me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I can just do whatever I want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're gonna give me the salary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's the latest,
the greatest ski season. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - See you. I'm like,
Thanks for the paycheck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is why I'm never
gonna be hired full time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Say Shannon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No I've said that? This is bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe that's for the better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. True. True. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, they go to
some really dark stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a shame that it's not being Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like a kid make
waves. Maybe it's too real. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's just purely the
fact that a Japanese person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> will look at that and be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want to see this because
it's just gonna remind me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of reality. And so a
lot of Japanese people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not the reason
why they watch anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was a really one dark
bit. I mean I think sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You can remember it in
the new season. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I spoil it. I won't say who it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll just say what happens. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no, no. I know what
you're talking about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe we shouldn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can't say that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? Is it that bad? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a bit of a twist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Haven't watched the-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's pretty bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just watch the whole
season. It's amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, regrets
carries is like killing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've had mixed reviews about
the fourth season, actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Some people have said that it feels like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's said everything
it's needed to say now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like they're trying
a lot to bring something new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the table. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - First five episodes, really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Last first episodes, boring. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like completely unnecessary.
I did not like it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> That's how I felt this. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I felt like they had a good
thing going and then they just-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It definitely, it
fizzles out at the end. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's still a salt season though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I also watched all of Mushoku Tensei. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ooh. Look at you watching anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I said I was gonna all of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All of it. One entered. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Round of applause. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Round of applause. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thank you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> After, I said I would
and everyone was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Connor's not gonna watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then there was a bunch
of comments that are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hope Connor doesn't watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I know he is gonna hate it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you hate it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I liked it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I liked it. I thought
it was good, honestly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, it was really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can see why people
think I would hate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the first episode
I was like, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We champ, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, listen, listen,
the way it starts is weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause he gets Isekai as you do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it's the first Isekai.
That's all I knew about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Was, it was the only thing
I knew about the show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is that it was the first-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like whenever Connor hears Isekai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> flashbacks of me talking like in-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Basically, basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I went into this with an open mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't read any reviews.
I didn't watch any videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know anything
about Mushoku Tensei. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All know is that everyone hypes it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, okay, I'll watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Be me right, first
episode, Mushoku Tensei. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he gets Isekai as a toddler. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> This thing he does is
starts like admiring, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like the woman's tits. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, oh this is the
show that everyone's hyping up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> This is it, this, this is it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - He doesn't, he didn't
just admire the tits. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He like makes a shrine out
of like one of their panties. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. So the whole,
first like two episodes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just him being like an imbecile. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I completely forgot about how -- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was the one episode
I have erased from my mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's like an imbecile, And I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are we seriously just gonna watch a guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> another show where an
indocile just gets rewarded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with a massive cock in the new universe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bestowed confidence, magical
power is the most op guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And never has to overcome
the fact that he has really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unhealthy views towards
women and sex and everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But this one was good,
'cause I felt like they, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he actually at least somewhat
learned that, Hey maybe, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe the way I viewed
women was kind of fucked up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the past. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, it can
be done. Anime can do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not only was this the first Isekai, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was the first self realized insult. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - On top of that it was a good show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, this is
great. This is fantastic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because not only was the
world building amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was really like into the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I loved all the characters,
even the parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who they easily could have just been like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh it's just parents. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I was really surprised. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They built everything up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was really surprised when the parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> were just characters. Cause
normally you see anime parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are just like half the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're not even there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember watching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And when they are there,
you can't see their eyes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was remember watching
because I'm so used to isekai </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> speed running this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which he gets transported, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> starts like getting the girl,
starts beating up the dudes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm five episodes into Mushoku Tensei. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, He's still with the parents? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's what's going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I realized, wait a minute, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm actually getting invested
in the family dynamic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the family story and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It really is like the
slow cooker of isekai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where everything else is
just like a microwave. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can, I spoil one minor plot point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not a big deal. It's
really not your bunch spoil-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Spoiler warning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Spoiler warning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The moment I knew this show
was built different really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Was sitting there watching
episode six or seven. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It just starts. And the
first thing that happens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is it's like normal family life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like, the husband has cheated
on the wife with the maid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she's pregnant. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like what the fuck is this show doing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And there was like a
whole point where he like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> our 10 year old protagonist was diffusing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this Jerry Springer episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, what is happening in the show? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is this an isekai or
Jerry Springer's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you are not the parent. And I
said, yeah, what's going on? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I was so like, I was like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, is this good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is good. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think this is fun. This is great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they actually get
into world building later on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean, what I like
about it is that it does take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that time to like build up shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with all this, Jerry Springer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just to say like, Hey, dad's
kind of an ass hole as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He can do bad things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He ain't the perfect human being. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then like, it helps it just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it all plays part into
like his journey, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think the biggest
down point was you finish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the first season. You're like
this story hasn't even begun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought I missed an episode
or something when it ended, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I was looking. 'Cause I
thought, oh my episode 11, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it must be 12. 'Cause
it ended so abruptly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, oh, where's the episode 12? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I was start running
the new season I was sucked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean that I had one less episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You wanna hear on me?
I've only seen first season. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Second season's amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The second season is really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Second season is where you
get so much of the payoff? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Of what was like the world
building that's built up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the first season. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I would be quite annoyed if I watched it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and season 2 wasn't out. 'Cause
I think I feel blue ball. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it was a great show.
Like again, I wanna, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't give credit enough, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but the fact that they
actually like just-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did something different? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - did something different and it worked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And the fact that this
is the first Isekai. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which makes me like really concerned. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why did they not take the
good parts of this show? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> What I can't understand is
how they take this concept </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of the main guy being an indocile. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what he is. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just gonna keep saying it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I absolutely hate these
characters as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because what what's up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Director] Correction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Technically the light novels
were like ReZero and like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I was okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. I was going to
correct him afterwards. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's not the first isekai, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's one of the most prominent isekais </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that popularized-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The genre. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - A Lot of the genre. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, so let's say this is
like one of the first big ones, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if everyone is trying to take from this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> why do they take all the worst aspects? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because Isekai to me
is like I said earlier, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just dudes who don't
have to ever address </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the fact that they were
shitty in the life before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they just get a free Doover </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where they get everything done for them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean it's weird seeing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was weird
watching this after watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so many Isekai that have
been inspired by this show, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because with most genres you
have like the progenitor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the thing that popularized
a lot of the tropes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and by the time you watch it-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a nice word, progenitor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Progenitor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Doesn't even sound any real word. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Would you pull that one out, Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - By the time you watch that one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've already seen all the tropes before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you're like, well,
this just feels dated now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't get why everyone
hyped this thing up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the first place, because
by the time you see it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone's already done
all the tropes differently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and better. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But with Mushoku Tensei,
it's like so many stories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just missed the point of why
the Isekai is the way it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why is it an Isekai in the first place? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, it's because he's
transported to another world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to give himself another
chance at life and people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And a lot of stories took that as just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, let's just put this
kind in a fancy world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just disregard the fact
that he had a previous life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just, there's so many subtle things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about Mushoku Tensei as a
story that I feel just got lost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> over time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In the different iterations
of isekai that came after. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's not to say there's
not other isekai shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that come after it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That haven't been good.
But like, it seems like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. There are a dime dozen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like the fact that he
had to, sorry, go George </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It just seems like
so many stories just took </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the surface level elements of this story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without really thinking about
why those elements were there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the first place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is like, maybe Rezi
did this a little bit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but not to the same extent, but like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is the only other
Isekai guy that I've watched. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure there are
others that have done it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where he actually had to deal
with the trauma and fears </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that he had in his past life
carried over into this one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause like, let's say you
come into this new life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you were scared of snakes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're not gonna be magically,
not scared of snakes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You've got the same brain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's still scared of going outside. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I liked that they
had to deal with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I love that he had to
work through all of his issues. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Of course I wanted the plot
to go ahead and I wanted him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to become op and kill everything
and become the giga chat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I also wanted to see
him actually have to work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> through the shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You wanted it to be
believable when it happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's so much better
payoff when you get to see that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause like I was also at
the point when I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when's the, I'm enjoying this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but when's the plot gonna happen? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I've slowly come to realize that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever an episode is
labeled turning point, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like pack like
put your seatbelts on boys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because some shit is gonna go down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I've heard from
like light novel readers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they're just like,
oh, just wait till you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to turning point 4 or 5 or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, there's turning
point 5? What is going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Basically just a drift course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, I love shows that
are confident in their world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they don't need the
characters to be the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's they are so comfortable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The world lives independently
from the characters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, we just happen to
be following some characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in this world. That's interesting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We could follow any of the characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and you still have a great time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I honestly I'll give
it like a 9/10 so far. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like a proud father. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love it. I love it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a good show. Honestly, it's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like if you're like me and
you're so done with isekai, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd give this one a shot.
It is genuinely worth it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - When's this episode coming out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Director] This one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hold on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probably the end of the month. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> End of the month. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - End of the month. February. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Director] I think
first week of February. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - First week of February. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow. What's up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The first week of February. Yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why I give Mushoku
Tensei anime of the year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I just didn't wanna spoil that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I mean, I understand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like, I haven't watched odd taxi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or anything like that yet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but I mean, I was watching
it and I'm like, God, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're just doing everything right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. I can't
complain about anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, the only thing I
put it above that was "Arcane" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as the best show of this year, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's been zero days literally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Arcane" movie is better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Arcane" is pretty good though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Arcane is pretty damn good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, I mean that's
yeah. I'm so fucking happy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm I'm so happy that-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, when your
son finally starts getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> an interests in sports
like football or like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is this what gratification feels like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're gappy. I like,
what if I came in there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> guns blazing and shit. Can't say-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I honestly thought you
wouldn't like it. 'Cause-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why do you think that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because a lot of the
characters, like I said before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they are well written characters, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but a lot of them are
like very trophy, very-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There are some, there are some. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Very trophy, but I still think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're well written characters, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I just thought you'd look at that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you'd just be like, not a
fucking Cray with red hair-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, she was annoying.
Don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> She's was probably my
least favorite character. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Out of all the characters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I felt like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is hard to look
past the trops sometimes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Didn't really like the main
character much. Actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't really like him as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, I kind of liked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I understand why he's not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think his intention
was to make him likable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> from an audience perspective. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I actually think who's the character, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the character I liked the
most actually was the spur. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love the spur, the green
name, the green head guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ruijerd. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was sick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you said, I like the languages </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they actually spoke languages. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That was really refreshing
for once where you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> are they speaking a foreign language? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause they're always
just speaking Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Finally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I remember
when they were speaking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, when are they
gonna switch to Japanese? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like world building, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Its just make sure like
invest in this place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it pays off when
he learns how to speak </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> these languages. Like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God, this is what
is like to learn a language. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God. Speak it in a reasonable bound. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the real world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the real world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Holy shit. Who would've
thought I have so much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of an appreciation for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Knowing what he went through
to learn that language. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is one of those shows
where I'm actually glad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a light novel before
it's an anime or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I think that it's
really gonna benefit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from being in like a long form written. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. So you can cash out the details. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They can really get like the world set. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause sometimes when shows come this big, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they kind of get to the point
where like, oh we gotta, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we gotta get the seasons out, come up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the hot shit. Come on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We gotta finish it. So I'm
hoping that doesn't happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I hope the anime 'cause I'm not
gonna read the light levels. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause the anime's so
good. And why would I? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean like the anime's so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The production values were like insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like some of the animation-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Season 2, the jump
from season one to two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was definitely noticeable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I noticed that it got better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it looked a lot crisper. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean it's just an all
around amazing production. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Watch sugar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll definitely have to watch season 2. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've been talking about it for ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, so happy right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm happy. I'm happy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what Connor?
Maybe I'll play Apex. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - When are you gonna play Apex? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe I'll play Wins or Apex dream corner. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How many hours-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You are like that dad that's like, son, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, how many. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll do something you like this time? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Count the exact run
time of Mushoku Tensei </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's how many hours you play actually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that seems fair. That seems fair. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When this episode ends
I'll play Apex with you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There we go. There we go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> There we go. Content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Titan has fallen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I've got a
second channel now guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and we we've all got a second
channel that we upload to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The Garnt channel is gonna
turn to an Apex channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I uploaded every other day
on that channel in January. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every other day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How did you have that much content? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Stream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Backlog. I have a
backlog as well on there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. 'Cause I took all of January off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't upload any videos
in January. Or maybe one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. 'Cause this is
before the end of January. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just like, how are you saying this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> When, when we we're right
in January now I have to-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - All my plans always go
correctly without any backfire. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This might be a enthusiasm
moment, but yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So yeah, I took a month off
and it's pretty chill ready? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Weird waking up and not
thinking about YouTube videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Kinda just thinking like,
oh my stream leader. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I might play some games, go gym. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Live a life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Live a fucking life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have a life for once. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because I noticed
that you haven't, I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you two haven't really thought
so much about your upload </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> schedule, which you did before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just for this month? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, your main channel was least. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just wanna take a month off
and get some stuff in order. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I've got a bunch of
videos that really are big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I need to finish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I know that if I'm
trying to do them weekly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it'll be a mess. So I just wanna get them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've got like three big videos
in the works at the moment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm trying to get them all done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then hopefully February
will be a nice roll in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably gonna do a bunch
of more back to normal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you feel like after
you do the big projects </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you're just gonna
go back to your normal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> upload schedule or are
you gonna focus more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on streaming now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe I'll miss a week here
and there not feel too guilty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about it. I'm probably
try and do three a month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that'll be my soft target. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Three a month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I'll probably try and
do once a week, but we'll see. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's just above my
upload schedule actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I feel like if I miss
a week, it's not a big deal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like now right on my phone, I check, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I check the other day. 'Cause I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't uploaded in
like two and a half weeks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wonder if anyone's saying anything? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, no, no one's commented anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, of course not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So clearly nobody
misses that'd be right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's exactly what I
realized when I realized, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't have to do an anime
of year video on the new year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I could just wait a few
weeks and people were just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> great. I'll still watch your content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who would've thought
that the only ones who care </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about our timetable is us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And no one else. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I feel like when you do weekly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it just posture a bit
more. You do do good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course, but you also, I
feel it also limits yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to what you could actually be doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So which is why like this year for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm definitely gonna like slow
it down and just like really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> focus on like making each
video as big as possible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then for everything
else, I got Trash Taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and like my second channel
and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So what is the main channel anymore? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> When Trash Taste is-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is the main channel now . </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That be real, this is
the main channel now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is where the big ideas are going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is where it's all going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're doing more specials this year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're gonna stream every week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You heard here first. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well this February. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hope this doesn't
become Poliage thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I read every
I'm saying it publicly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Obviously there will be breaks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah, I think, I think
for all of us, like our, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for this year, definitely Trash Taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is slowly be coming
more over the priority. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think when it comes to
just like making cool shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. 'Cause we enjoy
it, 'cause we enjoy it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And who knew that just having
a job of your best mates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty chill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - God forbid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have a carry every week. That's life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Speaking of watching anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know a bunch of people who
have also been watching anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very publicly. It's
probably very old news. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> By the time this episode gets released. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was the dumbest shit of 2022 so far. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 2022 has just begun.
We're already taking an L. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, basically at
the time of recording, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Pokemon has been banned
for watching Avatar, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The Last Air Bender </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and also Disguised Toast
has also been banned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for watching Death Notes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I believe on their twist streams. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> To their tens of thousands of viewers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And by the time this gets released, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe more people will
be banned. Maybe not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. But it's
definitely sparked a discussion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about copyright and DMCA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think people online
are calling it the TV meta, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which I couldn't fucking
believe was a real thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Polygon wrote this
article that was like, oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this guy starts, he was just
testing out the TV meta. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think my favorite comment, I saw, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna quote retweet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was, "Calling it the TV
meta is like shooting yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "in the head and calling it the gun meta." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Lime wire wasn't Paris. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just engaging in the music meta. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The TV meta strand is piratey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pirating doesn't do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So dumb, it's so dumb. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the dumbest argument. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's crazy. Like watching
stuff like the Totally Not Mark, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> With like torrent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Just like nuking his channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> For like talking about one piece. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. For not even breaking DMCA. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then the Twitch
streams just go and watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the entirety of Hunter Hunter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Because I remember
like when I first heard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about this, I thought it was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought it was actually
just like a joke. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought it as like a parody article, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, where's the onion article? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I log onto Twitch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I see one of
like the biggest streamers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> on the, I'm just gonna, I saw
XQC streaming Hunter Hunter, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like in it like a hundred thousand people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, I was
watching ,cause I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is there a meme? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like where's the meme come?
And then I, you realize, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh they weren't joking. People
are actually doing this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then Connor informed me that Ludwig </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had already made a video about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think what bothered
me was that people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were calling them out for
calling other people out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for being like, yeah. why
are you knocking on people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> imagine you are like
broadcasting a football match </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in a football stadium that you don't own </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because that's what the
equivalent of it is. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> They're broadcasting this
to like 90,000 people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And one guy like, "Is that allowed?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And people are just actually
like, sh don't tell people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just like, are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There's 90,000 people
watching this right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How could you snitch on someone
when there's 90,000 people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching this one thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so dumb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And the fact that they're trying to argue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's fair use or anything.
It's just so stupid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the fair argument's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I understand. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause a lot of the
viewers who watching this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> They probably loved watching
SQC watch "Hunt Hunter". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure everyone would
love to watch us watch "Jojo". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Unfortunately, we can't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause one we're not fucking
dumb. We don't watch shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We'll literally be breaking the law. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did a watch along of Jojo on my stream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the previous season, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but I didn't show the
visuals. I didn't show audio. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I show a time stamp. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can go to your Netflix
and we can watch along. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not as good. Of course it sucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you can't see it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's against the law to do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And also we live in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We probably actually be
thrown in jail if we did that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Oh yeah. No you will. You will. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like, what annoyed me the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about it was again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like it was people trying to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was very like tribal in a
sense where they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can't say my stream
is bad for doing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were just watching
doesn't do any harm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So what if they get banned?
It's like, yeah. But yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because that streamer already
makes like 5 million a year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Of course they don't give
a fuck if they get banned. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like what about the guy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's other smaller
streamers who maybe enjoy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the freedom to the
current copyright system </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where they can kind of, tow
the line a little bit safer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not watching stuff, but
maybe I can show YouTube, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe a clip. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Remember you couldn't watch
YouTube on Twitter before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You can now, even then
that's controversial. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. But I just feel like
it's selfish of like the bigger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> creators who already are well established, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't have to worry about or anything-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they can get away with it as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They'll come back, they'll get banned, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll come back. They don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - If anything, them getting banned, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> its just more publicity to them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Because that's why, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like you can get banned
and you're a headlined </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and people are like, oh
my God, you're banned, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> how that's so crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> We'll come back and like
you'll get even more views </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you come back. It's like,
it's just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It just seems selfish to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And the fact that everyone's
trying to call it a meta </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and play a joke with it and
stuff is really frustrating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when, we work in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We talk a lot with the anime companies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and try and work with them
and try and convince them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that YouTubers and
stuff aren't psychopaths </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and can be trusted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's what
bothered me the most. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is like, as someone
who does make content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that really does require fair
use and a strong argument </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for fair use even I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like sometimes I'm still like
touting the line sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with how companies view my content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it's such a new concept
that it's going to take time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to like convince big companies that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Hey, please don't strike my stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it is under fair use. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And when you have like like this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then on the other end of the spectrum, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have people just
broadcasting, licensed TV shows, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> movies, anime, whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just, what's going to happen is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just going to make it harder </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the 60, 70 year old
guy looking at new content </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be like, well I guess
everyone's just broadcasting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my shit. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well I guess I should
strike down everyone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What it's the thing that's
gonna happen is that it's gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make it hard for big corporations
to tell the difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> between what is fair use and what isn't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Because when there is people
who are abusing the system, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because this is an abuse of the system, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then it's just gonna be harder
for the guy who is actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to stay within the system to prove </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that he's actually
staying within the system. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel there's just
so many like YouTubers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Twist streams, just
content creators who are like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> doing our best to like at
least try and like yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as you were saying, like show
the Japanese corporations </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being like, hey, fair use is a thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're not using your stuff all the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for malicious intent. We do it
because we genuinely love it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> We want people to know about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But we will follow the
rules that are laid out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as much as we can. But at the same time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I scratch your back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you scratch mine. like kind
of like forgive me sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But now with this whole TV meta, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if I feel all that effort
has just gone back to zero. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Especially on Twitch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - If it works, if speculating of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But like obviously like
it could really damage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a matter of time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean the music industry did
it with Twitch, eventually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like, oh, shit yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You shouldn't be shoot or
streaming music. It's not good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And people are like, whatever,
testing out the music matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because the other thing that bothered me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that you can't really feign ignorance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because there is a precedence for this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTubers have felt it for years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with their copyright system,
even Twitch streamers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I know a lot of Twitch
streamers complained a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when they had the DMCA
controversy with the music thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Where basically every piece
of music just got claimed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and you couldn't even play some games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because some of the music was copyrighted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which was bound to happen anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Which was bound to happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTube have been dealing
with that for years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's very entitled. And
the that's what it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It is entitlement. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A lot of the streamers
that were doing this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like, don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause why would they? They don't mind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They get the headlines,
they get the views. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They already got paid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> They already have these
contracts with these companies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they know they'll come back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. They know they'll come back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause they get special
treatment. - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. And then you have
like people on the other side </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of the fence, people like
totally not mark, who like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if you don't know a story
behind what happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with Totally Not Mark, I
believe like TOE striked, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hundreds of his videos at once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 150. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Over like 150 videos at once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Some of them not even, even like having </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> any copyrighted material on there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some of them were just like,
I believe his face or like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some of them were drawings
of dragon ball characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that he drew. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so his channel
basically got completely, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like so many of these videos
got completely wiped away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was like fighting tooth and nail </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like try to get into
contact with Toe, to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> please Toe, bring my videos
out of copyright jail, please. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is fair use. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I believe that even
now it's not been sorted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I believe now he is-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - He basically just like gave up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I believe he just gave up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is so hard brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I think like a third of
his channel just disappeared. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, could you imagine that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like years of work just gone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And that, to me, it's
just like, well it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's this guy fighting
tooth and now to try and prove </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that his videos are fair use
and his videos do deserve </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be in the platform. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they are fair use. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To like a company that
doesn't know the difference </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> between fair use and not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then on the other
side of the spectrum, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have other people who are
abusing the system to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> well, whatever the ban ham is coming down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can take like a two day
vacation, a month vacation, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the people who feel the repercussions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are the people who are like on
the load end of the tier list </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with, let me rephrase that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Lower end of the spectrum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Lower end of the spectrum
of Twitch streamers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The smaller content creators. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the word I was looking for, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the smaller content
creators, the smaller boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - A lot of these, the
bigger content creators, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think highly often it just
kind of sad seeing them do this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like some of them just not
caring. And I was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is just sad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I also just think you
should be a good example. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like why don't just like make stuff? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. Like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because what's gonna happen
is the big streamers do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then everyone goes, oh, if
the big streamer doing it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can do it too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But of course they don't
realize those big streamers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if they get in trouble
or they'll get as a slap </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the wrist, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if the smaller creator does it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're probably perma banned. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I'm just like
to preface this, I don't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this isn't like us trying to start drama </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with any of the content
creators that did this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because a lot of the content
creators, I actually respect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as content creators. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like Connor said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just a bit disappointed
that they didn't set </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a better example because I know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we are all content creators. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> We know what's going on here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We know what the
repercussions are going to be, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that what they could
be. So it's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I couldn't understand why they
were poking the Hornets nest, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some of them were doing it intentionally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to get banned as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Some of them admitted that,
that they wanted to be banned. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's good for headlines as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> If you're a bigger name
and you have more websites, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause they're websites,
they're just dedicated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to literally just talking
about Twitch streamers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And then post these articles,
they get them recommend to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all the time on Google. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just like, "You won't
believe what Ludwig said." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it'll be like, Ludwig's
like, "I like jumping." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate these articles. They're so shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Welcome to journalism. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a little thing called
independent journalism. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's like how have you
then at least take a click bait </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and not even made it somewhat interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's even more boring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Now, because, I think what
the other thing that made me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lose brain cells when I was
like scrolling on my Twitter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to see what the reaction was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was the amount of people
who were calling out people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who were like, basically saying, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey, maybe you shouldn't
stream or broadcast anime movies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "to like your audience, whatever." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And anyone who said that was
basically basically caught </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out to being like for being
like a corporate boot licker </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Or just like, why are you
defending the corporations? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just like it turned the argument </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into something completely different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we all know DMCA
is like a decade old law </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that is outdated for
how the internet works. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're concentrators. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We know that there are so
many things that are broken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about the DMCA system. We know that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's a separate issue
to what is going on here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A system can be broken and
people can also abuse the system </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> at the same time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They don't have to be mutually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They don't have to be the same thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They can be mutually exclusive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And just seeing people try to defend this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like kind of just
made me lose brain cells. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was weird. It was really weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seeing how open everyone was like, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no, of course it's okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, yeah, just 'cause you like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it doesn't mean it's okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And just because you can't
be bold to go to Google </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and look it up yourself. It's like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like obviously it would
be sick to watch anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with 90,000 people live. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it would be sick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would love to do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We can't, we're not allowed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Until I get up these like IP holders, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> understand that it's okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we're not saying this
shouldn't be the case. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I would say that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if a company wants to be five heads, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they would allow people, they
would allow people to stream </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all that old forgotten shows
and bring it to a new audience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that would be a five head move. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But until people allow
it, it's still illegal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're still putting risk
on, in an entire platform </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you're gonna put the clamp down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for all the content
creators on that platform. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like that Japanese
YouTuber who got to react </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to all of attack on Titan
and like got promotion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - He like uploaded all of him-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. He had this deal
with Attack on Titan IP. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's crazy. How did he get that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he was just like, oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So you got a second channel.
It's got like a million subs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just put all of Attack on
Titan on it. You're allowed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. With him reacting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I saw that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was him reacting to it.
And it was completely legal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's crazy to me is
that like the whole entire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> YouTube community, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone on everyone online
hated reaction channels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They came down so hard
on them in like 2015, 16. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then like, why is it different now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now. Everyone's-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What happened, is it 'cause it's live? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that the only difference?
Like I don't understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Twitch matter. The TV
matter, the react matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The react matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess what we've
learned is that it's bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a bad thing to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Unless your favorite
content creator is doing it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then it's not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right. That's a
good message to end it on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a good message. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just want to go
throughout like all of history </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just start calling like
the most despicable acts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of human history. Just like a matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do the after Joe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right. Well, if you guys, hey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you guys wanna join the patron
medal? Look at these patrons. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> TV meta is now my least
favorite phrase of 2022. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - NFT, TV. Meta, what
about the NFT TV meta? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What about the NFT meta? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're just going through
the blockchain meta right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ah. Gross. </SPEAKER_04>
