<SPEAKER_02> - Hey guys, do you like charity? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gamers, we have a big announcements. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We are going to be doing
a 24-hour Charity Stream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You heard that, right.
(Joey jubilating) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So the whole situation
kind of messed up right now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for all sorts of different reasons. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So we thought we would come together, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stream for 24 hours to support </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Doctors Without Borders
on our Twitch channel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> twitch.tv/trashtastepodcast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What are we gonna be doing
on that stream though, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is the question you're probably asking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We have a bunch of
different things planned, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> including guests, games and humiliation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And Joey will eat a ghost
pepper, maybe who knows, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if we raise enough money.
- Maybe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Maybe, maybe.
- Maybe. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So make sure to open up that wallet </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> to make sure that Joey can suffer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the reason we're doing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not here for the charity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm here to make Joey suffer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So the event will be starting 11:00 AM, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Japan time, on the 19th of March. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you live anywhere else in the world, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> here are some just basic time
zones, that hopefully Munah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is putting on screen right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If not,
- 6PM PST. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Look it up yourself on time converter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, it'll be going on 24 hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and we'll hopefully change
the world for the better, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even for a little bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And on with the episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (burping) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What?
- Why do you have to do that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> on the mic? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why not? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pretty sure that's how down
with the Sickness starts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it is, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (burping) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - The way that kick off very quickly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You can't, you can't right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Not for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hm, I thought I was too perfect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> in my impression of Disturbed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (bright cheerful music) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Welcome to this
episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And today we're gonna be
comparing our musical tastes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Our trash taste in music, or good taste, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who knows, maybe one of us
has good taste in music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I've five.
- Said no one watching this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Unfortunately we can't plead the fifth </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> in Trash Taste episodes,
which I would love to do, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> cause I don't really know how
to describe music very well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, I've.
- We've established that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> very early on in the
Trash Taste wall, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, see, we've
established that with Connor, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but, I also have been shitting myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the thought of this episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and especially when it came
to like picking my choices. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> One, it was super difficult
because I didn't know like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't know how to describe why I liked, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the picks that I picked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just know that they were important to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at a time in my life.
- We gotta see why we like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah?
- Fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm fucked, I'm fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess like, on what
basis did you pick it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it's like, I guess,
Garnt was saying that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was an important, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like important artist in your life, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Mine is all also kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> based on that, in a sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, actually, first question, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how did you boys, what method did you use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like pick your artist?
- I've said, I've said. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno, I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Song they sang good I put down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, Connor's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Connor's method is,
- Song good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do I remember the artist's name? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll put it down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause actually like, my
biggest difficulty, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that I like a lot of songs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I dunno if I like a lot of artists, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why?
- I like certain songs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from certain artists, but I feel like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm more like, I get into genres of music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like I get into like a certain genre </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then more than I get into
this one specific artist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or this one specific band. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if I do, it's like
very, very, very rare. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's pretty normal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the food, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, "I like French food. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "I don't like all French food" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's like, that's the way I see it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, "but I do
like all Mexican food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "It's pretty fucking good." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So I guess also I'll say
that's kinda how I view it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or how I see it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for me it was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I couldn't just like reach
into the nether and grab a band </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I'm sure if I did that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sure there'd be like
a million other bands </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that I just completely forgot about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like, "all right,
I'll split it into genres." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like, "all right,
I like metal music, fuck." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> That didn't make it any easier. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like SpongeBob writing
the, my first fourth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My first fourth picks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like so confident like, "oh this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, oh this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, wait, what else do I listen to? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh shit."
- Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I literally went. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, we had our first
four, five picks that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> easy he came to our head.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I went through
my Spotify to try and see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I could narrow down anything
else that I could talk about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or was important to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the more I scrolled,
the more I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the fuck is my music taste? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is actually, this
like collection of songs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I've put together
that defines who I am. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I tried to psychoanalyze
this and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "I don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "what this fucking person like." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I love about doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these three by three episodes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that, more so than our
audience trying to figure out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> what our tastes are, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> we find out what our own tastes are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We truly are.
- All right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I do really you wanna change </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of my picks, but we'll go with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> We'll go with it.
- We'll go with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, some of my picks were
like, I chose one band, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was more of just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanted to pick one band </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just to,
- Talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which you don't know?
- Talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> several bands that I
want to put in this spot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get those excuses out now, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Get them out.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get 'em out, set 'em up,
set up the, set 'em up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (conversing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh this one?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But this one is what I often,
that one time that I saved, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> he loved this song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing)
I also love it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess it's been, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, now that I think about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have like such a different
relationship to music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than I do to like other forms of media, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have like really games that
I could talk about forever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> About like, why I've really
fucking liked this game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Same thing with movies, same
thing with anime, obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But with music's always
been this one enigma for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because music's just been this one thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I like certain
things, I dunno why like it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's because most people, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when they listen to music,
(Connor whispering) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I just like it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No explanation. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sorry, that was terrible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think it's just because most people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when they're listen to music, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't think that deeply about
what they're listening to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no.
- There isn't a guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that like runs into
the room and he's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "Explain what you are
listening to right now." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He's like, "ah, the drums are good." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah.
- It's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when someone's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "what's your tasting music?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> You can just be like, "ah, metal." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't, too bad.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then he was like, "okay." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then that's it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, when people ask me
what on a taste music is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, "ah."
- Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yes, I like so, I like everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I like,
- I like songs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate being that guy who just goes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I like a bit of everything." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's just like the generic answer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but I literally don't know
how to answer that question </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aside from, "Yeah, I like
a bit of everything." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Should we stop giving
excuses to ourselves, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just get on with it?
- Go on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this is it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right, are we gonna do trash boxing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bring him back trash.
- As per tradition. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right, so I guess, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want Joey to go first. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't wanna go first either. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because I don't want Joey,
- I don't wanna follow Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't wanna have Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Like give him this, his
fucking presentation, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> this PowerPoint with animations. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't.
- Why he likes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this kind of call.
- My goal for this episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is to not be that pretentious music song. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, we need you to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that pretentious music.
- I don't want to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that pretentious music.
- Because you need to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> counter rights me and
Connor going, "Oh, boo, boo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "I like the beeps and the boos." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm being like, "Well,
the voice sounded nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I like the voice." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like,
- I like the voice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it's Connor first.
- It's Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, perfect, alright. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is gonna be tough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is like my mom's gonna walk in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's a shit everywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm like, "Listen, I can explain. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "This has a reason." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - All right, go on, man.
- This is a weird </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> three by three, I think.
- All right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Some of them you'll expect,
some of them you won't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> or so I chose, I try
to choose a funny image </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for some of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can think of at least three bands. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's good, that's good.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It can't be actually, can you really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought only one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> There's at least,
- I think of definitely one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I can think of at least three. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Aright, we'll find out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - All right.
- Let's find out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Do like the initial
I chose for the Weeknd? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where did you get the
image of the Weeknd? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like the famous picture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> This is a weird one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I can explain
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I got the three that I thought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, that's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What was the three that you thought. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] I knew Daft
Punk, Weeknd and Tempo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> That's good then.
- I knew </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he was gonna put that on them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] But Joey knows
I love Tempo and Parlor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey knows that and Daft.
- And Daft Punk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I put Bo Burnham on the left. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I got by Burnham.
- Okay, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That shouldn't surprise me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anri.
- Do you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is kind of like, we'll get into this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is more about city pop in general. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, okay.
- We'll talk about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, I don't
think I know the rest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is Parcels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Parcels? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so they kind of not well known, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's very similar vibes to Daft Punk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> plus this is a Breakbot over there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, Breakbot? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know Breakbot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I know their song though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know the "Baby I'm yours?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> The ladies and gentlemen, we got 'em song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, that's that's Breakbot? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's Breakbot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay.
- But I knew, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the rest their songs are amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've listened to some of their music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, their songs fucking slap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know if I know them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You've definitely heard the meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, you know the meme song? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Probably. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt blabbering) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, yeah that's nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, that's nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, have you ever
listened to that song </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> without it being base boosted? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I only know that song bass boosted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I mean, there's not
much I can, I kinda. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The band I listen to the most. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's definitely these five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> are the ones I listen to right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love The Weeknd. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He also drop the new album,
and I fucking love that album. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's a great album. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I guess, who do I
wanna talk about first? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Who's should I talk about first? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Who'd you want me to talk about first? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess you've talked about,
- Who's the parcels? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Parcels?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's talk about Parcels,
cause I don't think gone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So they've a band right now, I believe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, this is gonna be hard to talk about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I don't know a lot
about a lot of these people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> All I know is that I play
their music an awful lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay.
- I think they're a band </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that is based in Germany. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think they are German. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But they live in Germany
and they do kind of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's very funk, but also, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ah how do I describe music to people? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I only know people.
- Because like the guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the guy in that,
- I can literally see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor's brain cells committing suicide. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> As he's like trying to process this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know how to explain.
- I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I looked at this picture of Parcels </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the guy at the back in the middle </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> looks like George Harrison.
- Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he's weird, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, they look like Beatles
if they were around today. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know how to explain it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like they don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Munah] Parcels are an
Australian electropop. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, they're are Aussies.
- I like electropop, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Aussies?
- Aussies? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah.
- Oh, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like electropop.
- Let's go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like electropop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There we go.
- Electropop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you know, a lot of
the things you can see, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the influence of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> if you look Daft Punk in the middle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and be kind of like
little parts of Daft Punk, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they've experimented in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's probably where I
like, cause it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think my favorite Daft
Punk album is Discovery, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> which I've put there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I don't think there's many songs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> of Daft Punk I don't like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Given the first album is
probably the one I don't like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> the most, cause it's very
like more experimental </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as opposed to the other stuff they did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's all more
like rudimentary for sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And a lot of, some of the
songs in the first album, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I cannot remember the
name of the first album, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the one with the AM on the front of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Literally, I think it
might just be called AM. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I feel like I
only started listening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to Daft punk after like,
was it the Homework album? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that the one?
- Homework was their first. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not sure of this.
- Homework was the first one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where I properly got
into Daft Punk as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that's why most
people got into Daft Punk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Either Homework or Discovery. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I think it was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the first big hit was
Around The World, wasn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- That was what put them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> on the map my friend. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is the most
repetitive song in existence. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is it a AM, FM, is that the album? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [cameraman] About Daft Punk or? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, what's the album name? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You have to fact check
me on a lot of these. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're gonna need a
lot of fact check here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, we're good.
- We're good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone behind the camera check time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> fact check time, all right?
- We're gonna find the facts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - We need like seven facts checkers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Cameraman] Parcels
collaborated with Daft Punk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on their 2017 single or not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I didn't even know that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, there you go. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's probably where the.
- That's probably where, why? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause a lot of these
our artists that I find </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> that I've no idea who they are, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like YouTube recommends me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you know who I'm surprised </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is not on your three by three.
- Who? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joji.
- Joji? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't listen to Joji that much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Every time I go to your
house, you're playing Joji. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is true, that is true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've played a lot of Joji, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but I think I had faces of Joji. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I like Joji a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like Joji a lot, but. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That just sounds like
a band faces of Joji. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love Joji's music, but
there's only four songs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> that I actually listen to. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The rest of the album,
I don't really like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think at least for the first five, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I've listened to like everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from Tempo and Parlor, Weeknd,
Daft Punk, Breakbot, Parcels. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've listened to like everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And so the Parcels,
Daft Punk and Breakbot, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can just put on their albums. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Any song and I'll have a good time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "This is great." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if I'm in a car, those
are the three I'm playing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So this is all like recent taste, then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or as,
- Within the past five years, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> unfortunately my tastes
haven't really changed much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in the past six years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's kind of like I have phases </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I go into something else, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it always comes back
to that type of music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What did you listen
to when you were a kid? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is a good question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, right in the bottom
bottom right, is Biffy Clyro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you know Biffy Claro? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No idea.
- No idea who Biffy Clyro is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know but that
album covers is cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - So Biffy Clyro is a Scottish rock band. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they've done a. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Biffy Clyro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd say un-Scottish. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Watched it for Foo Fighters a few times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So if you like Foo Fighters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you want a more Scott
version of Foo Fighters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I might be butchering </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and doing an absolute
disservice to Biffy Clyro, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I liked Foo Fighters a
lot and the way I found them </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is that a lot of my friends
in school really liked </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Foo Fighters and when we were growing up, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's the kind of stuff they liked. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then I got into Biffy Clyro from that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I went to watched them live. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> That was the first concert I ever went to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - A Biffy Clyro concert? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it was amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, fuck it.
- I loved it so much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I would say this is a
good album to listen to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They had the really famous
one that came out before this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember the name of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's got like two big
colors on the front of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (man chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's got the name of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do they singing like a
Scottish accent as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, so that's what I love about them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, hell, yeah.
- Is that like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know how sometimes a
lot of bands whether they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> from Scotland, but they
just sound American somehow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's actually like,
"Hey, yo, how yo doin?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (blabbering, laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Something like that, sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Cameraman] Something
that I'm only looking for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is only revolution. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's it only revolution. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Cameraman] Daft Punk
first album was Homework. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Homework was the first album. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Homework, oh shit, I
thought AM came first, my bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay.
- I'm fake that much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it was their first album? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Cameraman] They've
got Random Access Memory, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I thinking about RAM. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Random Access Memory,
- That's probably like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an EP or something.
- Yeah, it might have been. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - EP first album.
- Oh, my bad then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I must have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I want
more bands to do though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because the one thing I
like sing in the accent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of the country that they're from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You should, I think you
quite like Biffy Clyro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because that's what I love about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what I love about
Proclaimers, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause like when they
sing The 500 Mile song, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> they couldn't sound any
more fucking Scottish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than that song, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I find it so weird
when I hear an artist, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you hear, you hear them sing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you hear them speak
and there is such a dissonance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> between how they sing and how they speak. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I remember one of the first
time I heard Adele speak. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's like the most Northern accent. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're British, why you surprised? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're British. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because she doesn't sound anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that which she sing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wow, probably for good reason. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Could you imagine an Adele song </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the accent that she speaks?
- Oh my. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Like there's no way she would've blown up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause no one would've
been able to understand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what she was saying.
- Put your body to the rain. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, Adele getting dragged to the media. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Rolling into deep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Rolling in the deep I am. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like that she wouldn't
have walked off, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, cause it's like, cause I had no idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she was British until I heard her speak. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And she was, then I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh this is the most Northern person </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> "I've ever heard speak in my life, and," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel a lot of Australian
artists are like that too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like Sia for example, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> is the most Australian sound
- I'm not sure I listen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to Sia a lot.
- Posts in an interviews. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But when she sings, everyone
thinks she's America. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> We lose our accents for some
reason, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, we can't like, I find it hard to, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> do an accent, but it's not hard to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> For some reason it's less hard
to sing an accent, I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's weird, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I find it easier </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to sing in an American accent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than I do speak in an American accent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't understand
at all, how it works.` </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't how accents work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how it works
when you sing though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a bit different register. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's why when
I hear an accent in a song, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it immediately like just
sticks out to me, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause you always hear like
the neutral American accent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with like a lot of songs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So when you hear an accent
that is just anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not like the stereotypical
neutral American accent, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it immediately just sticks out in my mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what, that's what I
want more artists to do though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause otherwise everyone's just
gonna sound the same, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's like, if there's
the best way to make you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> as an artist stand out, is
to just sound different. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Like just sing in a different accent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause then immediately you'll be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you'll listen to a Biffy Clyro song </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you'll be like, "Oh
they sound Scottish, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "must be a Biffy Clyro song." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean they're very, very Scottish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> when you hear them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's fun, I love it.
- Could you imagine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if Biffy Clyro, obviously
I don't know Biffy Clyro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But you said they kind of
sound similar to Foo Fighters? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I'd say it's
kind of in the same vein. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay.
- Its kind of feeling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of the way they sing song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So would you say that if per chance </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the Biffy Clara lead singer.
- Dies? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sang in an accent
- No, it wouldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> even sound same.
- like Dave Grohl, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> then it would sound
like Foo Fighters or no? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's weird because the
songs are so Scottish, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you listen to them, you'll, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think you might like them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They kinda seem like your
kind of band actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You love Foo Fighters, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I love Foo Fighters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I think you'll probably like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like Foo Fighters as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But you'll probably like them as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> if you like Scottish
kind of my take on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Again, I must be offending
like Biffy massive fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Massive Biffy Clyro fans? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah.
- So shake your hands </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like this.
- But like that's the only way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I know cause I'm, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't understand how to talk about music </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like a normal human being. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So this is the only way I
can imagine explaining it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But also it was like the first album, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I ever bought out of like physical, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think I only ever bought
like three albums in my life. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I think this was the first one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think after that, I think about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think I've ever bought an album. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love this so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember I loaded that onto my PC. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know I put it on my Xbox. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And you could play the albums on Xbox </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> while playing another game. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I would open up that
fucking (blabbers) menu. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The fucking big one.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I will press play, the
volume was just dreadfully </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like not managed correctly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'd play Modern Warfare two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just I thought that
I want you to feel it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, like that and I was like, it's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Its awesome. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I had a CD player
like the fucking chunky. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, I had one of those two CD. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, what's the
first album I bought on CD. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What?
- What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fucking Simple Plan? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Great.
(clapping) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Classic Joey, classic Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That album slaps, I don't
care what anyone says. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Man, but yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have a Tame Impala as
well, I love to Tame Impala. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> My favorite album is the
Slow Rush, not the other one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that everyone, that you see everywhere </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everyone talks about it.
- Oh, Currents. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's the one
that everyone praises. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Slow Rush is a good album.
- I love Slow Rush. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Breathe Deeper is not my
favorite song for Tame Impala. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love that fucking song.
- Great song. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, driving
to Tame Impala is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> another level of enjoying it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you listened to
his side project Pond? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It like Tame Impala you'll like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just,
- I probably pretty will. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just Tame Impala but harder. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, YouTube recommend
it to me, I'll find out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Probably not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Basically, that's how my music is decided. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have the algorithm gods
decided it's fit for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If so, yes I listen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But unfortunately, sometimes
it recommends me artists, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there's like one song I really like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I check out the other
stuff and I'm like (blabbers) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, there's lots of artists like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like that happens like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who is the one on the
left, above The Burner? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh this is, you know them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Snail's House. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, Snail's House, okay.
- Oh, is that Snail's House? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I love Snail's House. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Snail's House is good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Again, no lyrics, let's go.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't recognize the art. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah, I love Snail's House. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's probably like if I
can encapsulate all my, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess I don't even
if it is a disservice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to call it Weib Music? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's kind of like.
- No, it is Pond </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Weib nostalgic gaming site. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's subculture of like Weib. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's half Japanese, right?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like Weib nerdy shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like how,
- Weib nerdy shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like how this one makes me feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I like this one.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - There was a phase in my life </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> where I feel like I listen.
- How does it make you feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Happy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna say happy emotion.
- Happy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So there was like,
before I moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna say I listened
to this for like, God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like a whole year straight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I must listening.
- Were you prepping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your Japan visit with some.
- With? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Before I even started the move to Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was listening to them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then weirdly it was like.
- Fun? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I just love this album a lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Not this album, sorry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I love all of his songs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Absolute all bangers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All kind of different moods </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though like it's the same style, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like how it, it doesn't
always feel the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a bunch of variations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Shout out to Snail's House, banging. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you like anime music
or anything like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like electronic,
you're probably like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's really good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I call, I call
this genre, a Weep Call. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Weep Call. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's Wee.
- It is, it's like Weep Call. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's Weep Daft Punk? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Question mark. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know.
- Weep Call. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's no, there's no lyrics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's life.
- It's just a name for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It is Weep Call. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's Weep Call.
- Weep Call. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It feels like a rollercoaster you're on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That you're not on it, you're not on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you are a rollercoaster. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How describe? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> How the fuck do I describe music? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> How do you do this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How's Anthony Fantano do this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> How, what the fuck is he doing? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just a lot of adjectives. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like how I describe this music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like if you go to an artist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> if you go to an artist alley
in any convention and put that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and take that experience, put
that in the genre of music, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that is like,
- We can, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's Weep Call basically, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pretty much.
- It's not anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know that feeling
before you go to a convention, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously not now, cause
you're miserable adults, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> a few years earlier when
you're like kind of excited, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like bubbly, you're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh my God, I'm so excited." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the feeling, like
fucking shoved it into a job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that I can just like, anytime I want. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (burping) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can just take it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (moaning) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Snail's House to me is
like what it must sound like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to live in the Kirby universe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yes, as well.
- That's, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's what it sounds like to me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like fucking your enemies come up? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (burps)
- Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everything is like, everything is like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Done.
- You can suck on everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Done, over.
- Everything is like round </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like bubbly and pastel
colored and like overly happy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But in a good way.
- I could fall over. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> But the floors is made of mush, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I dunno how to, that's
like in a good way. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Not unlike it's a kids way.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Not like a condescending way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But like.
- I don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> how to describe it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's just like it's pillowy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, dude, it's great. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's great.
- It's such a. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you wanna be, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feel happy, and have a good time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you wanna feel vibes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> trust Snail's House and
you don't want lyrics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I honestly, sometimes
lyrics get in the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Somehow these lyrics get away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nah, no, I disagree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes, sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Someone who doesn't
even listen to lyrics, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel something missing
without vocal track. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, wait can talk about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We can talk.
- I have other picks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that we can talk about by the way. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The other one I wanna talk about, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I love the Weeknd and this is a weird one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because I feel very long. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Very, very long time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just kind of felt indifferent
towards the Weeknd. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I felt like it was that artist </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that just all always got like number ones, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but like, you know it was
kinda like (blabbers) whatever. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But then like the last album came out, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I was like, "okay,
no, this is all fire." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This is all like really fucking good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, I think he's actually like insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I went back and
listened to the other stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I appreciated it way more now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - After seeing how far he's grown </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and how much his albums
have like just improved. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I was definitely the same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Oh, this
is just like another," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The generic pop guy.
- Yeah, there's another. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bruno Mars X Figure.
- Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause like when I listened
to House of Balloons, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which was his first album, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Ah, this is like, it's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "But it's like nothing special." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then after Hours came out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> with like blended lights and I like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That album, I was like, "Okay,
okay I see it, I see it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then the new album was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, solidified
it, you're pretty good." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, this album, it's
been like out for like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, like two
months at this point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I've literally just
listened to that album nonstop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so good, it's so good.
- I think The Weeknd actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is right now the most
streamed artist on Spotify. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It wouldn't surprise me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's number one right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This album has so
many bangers that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so fun talking this album to people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because everyone I've spoke to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has a different favorite song. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not like other
albums where I'd say, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Okay, everyone likes X song the most, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "and it's very predictable." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's like, everyone is just telling me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about other songs they like the most. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Oh yeah, that
one is a banger too." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the best kind
of artist though, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where it's like.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, you can't pick like a top, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would think it's really difficult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for someone like The Weeknd, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to make like a greatest hits album. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, true.
- Because it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> which songs do we not
put in that album, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - True. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because every song's great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also I love that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wasn't paying attention to lyrics, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then I started actually
paying attention to the lyrics, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this current album, I'm like,
"Man, this is really sad." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's going on with this man? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like, "Yeah, I've gotta see a woman </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "and she's fucking another man." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm so sad that she's
fucking another man." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, "What, what!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like, "I loved her. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> "And then she stepped on my heart." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, "Whoa!" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - While in middies it's
like funk bass like plays </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> in the background.
- And then he's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> "Get that harmer, get
over, it's so good though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's so good, it's so good." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God, I feel that it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> "I wanna marry her bush,
we're best friends now." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And he's like, "Oh no, oh no, oh no. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> "What's going on, this is so sad." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's funny I love that.
- It's so fun, I love. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - How often do you listen to like mu, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> lyrics in never in songs.
- Never, literally, never. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what made you listen
to the lyrics in this song, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in this album?
- And I listened to it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so many times, after a
point I started like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just that he would say stuff
and I was like, "Hold on." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like The Rock behind me.
- Rewind that back, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> rewind that back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I listened to,
- Rewind that, rewind that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, "Hold on, what, what?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Jesus Christ man." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh my God." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then.
- But we're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> we're his therapist, you
know, we're just hearing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly.
- Bo Burnham? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, Bo Burnham
was one of those things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where you kind of have
to listen to the lyrics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to enjoy the music.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it really made me
see that like, "Okay." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause to me, comedy music before was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just fucking Lonely Island. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like "Weird AI" Yankovic,
kinda thing, not really. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah.
- I mean it's, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it was like parody music. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where they were kind of, for me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> it would like they would take a song </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or an established genre of music </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just kind of like parody that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> On like a surface level,
if that makes sense? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And Tim Minchin is obviously very, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone always loved him.
- Loved him, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like even there that music
I wasn't like super into it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I've watched my Bo Burnham
specials like all of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like at least four plus times now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I just love it to death. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I really like the
songs, they're really funny, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but also really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Some of them are like absolute bangers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love the one at the end of Make Happy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You've got the one where it is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's when he's talking
about Burritos had put the hand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the Prickle Ken, I can't
remember it, so to say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (chuckling)
What's the fucking term? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing)
- That sounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like something you'd really do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it's so good though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause it's like, it starts off as a joke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it turns into this whole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the struggle of being a creative </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and what people expect things from you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and how do you struggle with that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's somebody who creates stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "Oh shit,
whoa this is fucking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Whoa, this is weird." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Fuck it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you ever like get
into Lonely Island though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back in then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I loved Lonely Island. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right.
- And I was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I was like 14, I
thought this shit was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> peak comedy and music.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Oh my God, he
threw it on the ground." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my dude, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that song is so good.
- Oh my God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> he put a dick in a box? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Like, what the fuck! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, "This song, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "is talking about three song."
- We're just advancing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Damn, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - This song's about three songs? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (sarcastic laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know, cause I was a kid and
I thought she was hilarious. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I just had sex. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought that was like
the peak comedy, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nah, for me it was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm on a bar."
- I'm on a bar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, just like heard T-Pain </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> in there, for no fucking reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm,
- It was that and Like a Boss. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Like a Boss. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also remember when those were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the most viewed fucking videos on YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they were like, I literally
remember cause I have this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> weird memory of me playing Black Cops 1 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just playing Lonely
Island songs on repeat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> while I'm playing and I
literally did nothing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but listen to the Lonely Island. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, everyone was like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the early stages of YouTube though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But to me it was like Bo
Burnham is like it kind of took </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the best of like comedy and
then added it with like amazing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> funny standup with
amazing lyrics and great, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and I love the song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like one minute long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the fucking Jeff
Bezos song from inside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I fucking love that one.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You gotta listen to that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right.
- It's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause I've only seen inside, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but obviously it is one of the few artists </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I did listen to their
songs, cause he is like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess, I dunno how
you categorize or put, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> how do you categorize these kind of songs? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's like comedy songs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it also like, his songs
also make you think, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah.
- Like the message </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of like sticks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with you for a while.
- It's funny and deep. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Actually the best of all.
- Like the best of all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's too, is it too deep for you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's the Evan Gillion of comedy music. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just shut the fuck up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanted put it on, cause
I wanted to talk about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I thought that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was really interesting
- Yeah, he's great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you know, there's a lot of artists </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could have put on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I could have put a, I love Pendulum. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pendulum is fantastic.
- I wanted to see Pendulum. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I almost put Pendulum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I went to watch Pendulum live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was probably like their greatest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking experience ever.
- I'm sure, they're also good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I nearly died like four times
being stepped on to death. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But it was amazing.
- That must, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that must have been like audio crack, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude it was insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I went to go and watch Pendulum </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was in a warehouse, like
this concrete warehouse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was just like,
some kind of Satanic ritual </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that looked like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause it was just, this thing was so tall. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you just see this
massive hunk of concrete </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then just depends on
just going hard on scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Holy shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When I remember when Tarantula
came on, that was insane. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone insane.
- Holy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never been in such a
like, just intense atmosphere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't normally like going to concerts, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that almost really fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I need the lyrics as well, somehow, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I brought 'em into my memory. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I listened.
- Are there that many lyrics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> through Pendulum songs?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't remember.
- In some songs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean everyone.
- With Color, it's very easy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone remembers the
opening to Witchcraft. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the one song everyone
would just start singing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - She Ran, She Ran?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been listening to the Pendulum </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> since I was like fucking 12 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and I would listen them on and off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They were pretty inescapable back when. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Blood Sugar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I remember the remix.
- Propane Nightmares as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sugar was, Prodigy of
what am I talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like Pendulum and Prodigy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Prodigy that's it.
- Prodigy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was that fucking massive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like, they were
inescapable at a point where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I remember, like they came out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as like in the age where I
just started going clubbing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and like, you'd hear a Pendulum song </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and a Prodigy song, at least
once in every fucking club </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we goes, man.
- Pendulum is so good man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But I said like Pendulum was
definitely my early inspiration </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before I found I started
really getting into Daft Punk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Obviously Intastella, is amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And all the music videos
just go so goddamn well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> with the songs and I just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not the movie, the album. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I understand that perfectly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not the soundtrack to the movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then you got ANRI. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so this is just like city pop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is the, I can't
Stop The Loneliness song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Have you heard that one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I fucking love that song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> ♪ I can't stop the loneliness. ♪ </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno why I love that song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh man, we're gonna get
coffee, we're be right back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> You're too good.
- That's why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm singing it bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm singing it bad on purpose. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You're too good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But I love, I love city pop. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Obviously, I dunno how to
encapsulate all of city pop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could just put plastic
love and call it day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but, you know, I feel like
city pop has definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> blown up in the past. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What, four or five years, it's gone crazy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Even The Weeknd on his new album, Samples. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> A lot of city pop.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And it's so Goddamn good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like city pop with
the vocals for God. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just amazing, it's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I mean, I absolutely adore city pop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It makes me nostalgic for that
time that I lived in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the '80s, Strait outta the Window. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And was in the bubble period. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] It was a good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was a good time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was it literally Plastic Love
that literally like kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reinvigorated this city pop trends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's happening right now.
- I think so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> cause used to hear city pop occasionally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't think anyone
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The movement hadn't really taken off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think Plastic Love is
what really got people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into thinking abouts
listening to other songs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause I definitely heard city love, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> city pop songs before this.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But never enough to make me
be like, "Is this a genre?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno what this is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - and so, it was also
just like such a mystery </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> as to why it was that song that blew up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've seen like documentaries
on YouTube about like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> why did Plastic Love blow up and shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's like, because. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like,
"Cause it's a good song." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean like,
- Nothing more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also like the YouTube
algorithm just works </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in fucking mysterious ways. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, there's two ways
I get recommended song </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's memes or YouTube algorithm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly memes is like
a really underrated way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to discover new music. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause a lot of memes.
- Bro, great pop, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A lot of meme songs are
actually like good songs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- That you don't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd forget that they're good songs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's true.
- Because you've just heard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it base boosted so many times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Baby I'm Yours is an ironically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> like a fucking amazing song
and it's so fucking stupid </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that I can't listen to the song, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> without thinking of ladies
and gentlemen, we got it him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And the fall like,
(blabbering) it's awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Ruin my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, cause I remember when I heard, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first heard that song,
- Shut up, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It got recommended to me on
YouTube and I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh it's the meme song." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was waiting for like
the base boost to come in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and then it just, it was just the song. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I remember thinking, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Damn, why did they bass boost </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "this fucking masterpiece man?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like taking the Mona
Lisa and like spitting on it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> You know?
- Un-ironically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like crap dance song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's a good song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the Shooting Star song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Remember that one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh that was a good song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Sounds good.
(shooting star beats) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh yeah.
- You know that one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That one was like good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Actually.
- That's was good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's a great song. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They're great songs. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right, well that's my three by three. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Go and check some of them out,
- All right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - You might like it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you like Daft Punk, you'll
probably like a lot of these. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Others are Parcels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, you shouldn't try it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I love Parcels, man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Some of their songs are so fucking good. </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_02> Thank God that's outta way.
- Initial Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And before we move on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously you talked
about a lot of your music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that you're into now, but like what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm curious were you listen to as a kid? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you remember, or did you just not want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any of them on.
- Plague, plague. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, as all as you can remember. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I like Foo Fighters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was a big one, Biffy
Clyro, Pendulum, Prodigy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then I had that weird
phase where I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, Calvin Harris is really good." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was actually like this close </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with Calvin Harrison.
- No (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just to be like,
- Well, did I end racism. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He did end racism.
- I would have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, he did.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would be like, if I
didn't go through a phase </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I listened to a
fucked ton of Calvin Harris. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Listen, I'm not immune
to shit taste, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There was a point where
I listened to a lot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of Calvin Harris. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did you listen to a lot
of David Guetta as well? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, my God, sure I did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You know when you listen to that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Swedish House Mafia?
- The Aeroplanes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the night sky song? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're like, how about
I, I just want all music </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that sounds exactly like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- Like IPS, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When I have like no, no
fucking personality of my own, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would just listen to
what the charts told me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was good music.
- Well, the Billboard was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the Billboard top 100.
- It's top 20. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna, I wanna fit in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna see normal, I'm
gonna say I like this song. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love that new Calvin Harry song. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I felt like I almost like
listening to that music </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just so I could have, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could keep up with what
people were talking about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You keep up with, yeah.
- Cause I didn't wanna get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> bullied for like, you're
like Scottish bands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that no one talked about.
- No, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what the fuck's wrong with that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's back when,
- A lot liked it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was a lot of social pressure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like me listening to Calvin
Harris was the equivalent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of me watching football matches. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I could have something to talk about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like, "Oh yeah, you see a," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you see a latest football match? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh yeah."
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The you hear Calvin
Harrison song came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was pretty good, wasn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I feel like I never
really had defined music taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause I was kind of, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, back then I had to find
a means to get ahold of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that often was a big limiting factor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on what I could discover. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I did the opposite. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh I listened to that
recent Calvin Harris song, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> "but its shit innit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've never had.
- It's bullshit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, you have good taste show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You,
- Shit tasting music. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Shit taste.
- You have good taste as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When I didn't even like to think that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I didn't even listen to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> All right, I'm just
giving you a hard time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - All right, we should we
get on with the next pick. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right.
- All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you wanna pick it or should I pick? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can go for it, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Meal gone, it doesn't really matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Matters too me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not gonna matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I see a T. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, it's me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Thank God, you're saved, I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, thank you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Thank God, Joey can carry the podcast </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after I finished talking about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - My pleasure.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So how I tried to pick
this, I tried to pick this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I tried to pick music, and artist, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and songs that really defines
every stage of my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So this might be a little bit random. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're gonna see pepper
take the full album. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> What do you mean diaper music? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, let's see, witty spider? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bob the Builder soundtrack. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was a cold summer night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, the age of three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I decided it was on a summer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, twinkle, twinkle, little star. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Fucking banger.
- Thomas the Tank. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What can I fucking say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Has an absolute banger soundtrack. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> There's no like. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> - Postman Pat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Postman Pat, I fucking love that song. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, Ashley, put

<SPEAKER_02> Go on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This motherfucker will

<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay.

<SPEAKER_02> So I guess, I'll go through it from right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> from left to right, sorry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] I wonder all of these. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] You know, all these? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know the one.
- I do get. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] I don't know this one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't know that one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the, that's one of the two Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ones from their charts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know three Japanese ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's true.
- So top left is Muse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We got we got Muse.
- You know what I'm saying? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] We got Muse
and then we have Bradio </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we have The Kooks or is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, it's just Kooks, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Kooks, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] We have The Killers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> We have Michael Jackson. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] MJ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] We have MJ, come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We have Zutomayo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We have Daft Punk, Arctic Monkeys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and obviously the Fooly Cooly Sound. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno why I thought
those Ben's still off, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just saying.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, Ben still does not,
does not like that bag. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was like, "Damn Ben still got the." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> All right.
- All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So, where do you want to start off? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude, who Kooks? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like 'em that much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so the reason I
put The Kooks there, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Or Kooks I can't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is it the Kooks or is it just kooks? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It doesn't matter.
- I'm obviously a fan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Cameraman] Is that Kooks? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it the Kooks? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought it was the Kooks.
- That's what I thought. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is specifically inside
in, the inside out the album. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause it's one of the
few albums I actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have listened to all of the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the reason I put the Kooks in there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is because they are originally
a band from Brighton, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We gotta represent our home country. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But its like, I did not know this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I did not know this for the longest time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But listening to their music </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and listening to this album, especially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Before I found out they
were from Brighton, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like fuck, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this literally epitomizes
the Brighton vibe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Unlike what it is like being a teenager </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> growing up in Brighton. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It literally epitomizes
the vibe of going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this random fucking beach party, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or just going to a random house
party in England sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That privileged lifestyle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to pick up chicks or just you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just heavily binge drinking or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like if I had to pick
a show, for example, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a TV show that epitomized,
British teenage life, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it is The Inbetweeners. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you've seen The Inbetweeners, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've not seen a more
accurate representation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of what it is to be like growing up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> growing up at around like college age, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which college age is kinda
like high school age, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And to me, The Kooks is,
if you listen to this album, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is growing up in Brighton college age. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So about 16 to about 16 to 18 years old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's why it's on there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like I only know one song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think there were like
two big songs on there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's like Naive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And like.
- Yeah, Naive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Say naive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really like,
- Perfect accent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just like really drawn out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like every, every word, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I think just like
She Moves in Her Own Way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the other side.
- Oh, I know that song. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> ♪ Oh, oh. ♪ </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That one, that one is
like burned into my head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is because.
- It all the time in the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was the song that like
introduced me to the Kooks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I feel like those are
the two most, like Naive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and She Moves in Her Own Way, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I like the two most poppy
songs in their album </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because definitely their
later albums, they got like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they like way got way, like way
on the poppy side of things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were kind of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kinda like a Maroon 5 in that sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You compare early Maroon 5 albums </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> to the later Maroon 5 albums. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Okay, this is,"
- like night and day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, this is night and day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is like, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There was a point where I like Maroon 5 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then there's just like
billboard 100 Maroon 5. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know?
- You know like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Does she moves like Jacamo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - You don't like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, you're right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't like sugar? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't like sugar? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're going soon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love sugar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I will stick off
for like early Maroon 5. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think early Maroon 5 was
actually pretty damn good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I don't really know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what else to say about the Kooks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why the Kooks is on there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you want to have a.
- It's a good band, eh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's a good band,
it's a good Indie band. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So a lot of these, a lot of these, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of bands I wanted
to put on were of course, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Indie bands, especially a lot
of Indie bands from England, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I guess, because I did, I did go through, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think the period of life,
my life, where I went, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where I listened to the
most music is probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in between high school and university </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where I listened to a lot
of fucking Indie bands. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And a lot of that was
because I was actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in a band myself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't, I dunno if I've,
- Were you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I dunno if I've
ever talked about this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, you've never talked about this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We've never talked about this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have I ever, never mentioned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this to you guys?
- Never mentioned it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> What did you play.
- What did you play? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I play guitar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - What?
- Are you serious. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm serious, I'm serious.
- I didn't know this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Can you still play guitar? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why have we not started a band? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean.
- Do you know how long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I've been waiting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Me on vocals?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Joey on.
- No, Connor on vocals, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Garnt on guitar </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'll just fill the rest.
- Whatever, Joey's the prince. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You can do everything else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have I never mentioned this before? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- Never, never mentioned this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I must have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You've mentioned that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you used to play guitar like a little bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This feels like, so
you should mention more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This feels like a personality trick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel betrayed that you
haven't mentioned this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess like, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess I'll go again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Tell again to this story then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, let's start right at the beginning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Next, you gonna say that you
were a member of the Kooks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But yeah, I was one of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Absolutely Garnt was a
platinum selling artist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I guess the reason
I just wanted to learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> how to play guitar in the first place, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is my first choice on that, it's Muse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - I love the Muse.
- I remember the first time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> hearing Plug in Baby, and
just hearing that riff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Ugh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And like just something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - God like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Something just clicked in my mind. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was just like, "I need
to be able to play this." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I need to be able to play this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And like I remember before, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> my mom had always tried
to get me to learn guitar, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> cause she's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really like people playing guitar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, my mom thinks this is cool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'm just like, she set
me for like guitar lessons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as a kid and I never
really took them seriously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like, "I'm doing
this cause my mom wants me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "to do it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I can play fucking Oasis, Wonderwall, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever the fuck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which I would argue is the
only song you need to know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, the only
song you need to know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, I was just like, "Whatever." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And we only own a acoustic
guitar at the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And the I went, I remember I
went into secondary school, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is like just, I guess
just before high school age, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> in the UK or is it high school age? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno, secondary school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I remember the first
time hearing Plug in Baby. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Why did they never teach us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "how to play this in guitar lessons? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "What the fuck!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know how to play a
barcode, a bar chords, sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - what do I need to do to
learn how to play this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so the first thing I did was I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ditch your acoustic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I ditched my acoustic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I signed up for guitar lessons, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my secondary school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> "Mother, I would like
an electric guitar now." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Did she get you one? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Huh? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Did she get you one? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember we got a fucking
cheap ass electric guitar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from like,
- Amazon basics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, not even Amazon basics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got one lap that was
on like a carbon sale </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or something like that.
- Thought of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which was.
- Which is a trick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That did a trick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I can't even remember
what my first guitar was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It was a shit guitar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was one where I had to like replace </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all of the fucking strings on the guitar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause all of the strings
were like rusted already. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah.
- Oh my gosh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like at that point, I didn't even know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how to like properly tune or
change the strings of a guitar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So my teacher at the time
had to teach me how to do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean that's when I like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that's when I like first
properly got into learning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how to play the guitar, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and at that point, as the
point where I was building up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my skill level to you know,
be able to play Plug in Baby, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which eventually I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hell, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then, actually now
that I think about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> once I learn how to play Plug in Baby, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that my drive to improve my skill level, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just kinda just stopped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I have reached peak top. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like you know when you,
- There's never a need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to play it again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, when I like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know when you've reached
the goal you set for yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I just never found a
next goal, to set for myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So for me, it was just like play guitar, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to play Plug in Baby, I can do it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mother, I can stop playing the guitar now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God.
- Disposing of this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was one of the play guitar hero </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> more than one of the play guitar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then, so then in that
time, one of my friends, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he wanted to start a band and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Why not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I've got nothing bad to do at this time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, I can play the guitar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I might as well use it for some," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - First first day lessons. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you know, Plug in Baby? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tickle, tickle little star,
- We can play that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - And so, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I joined because
I wasn't doing really, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> doing anything with the guitar
aside from trying to learn </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how to play Plug in Baby. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I'm just like, "Maybe
I'll just join the guitar, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "maybe I'll just join a band for fun." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I don't think
we were the greatest band, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know, 'em after me.
- Did you ever play? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We played like a bunch of gigs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Actually I got like,
- What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've like, I think the
biggest crowd we played in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> was kind of like 500 to a thousand people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What!
- What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What?
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - How have you never told the story? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so I remember when we were tryna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think of a band name. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I think we have like a
fucking stupid band name. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay.
- They're always stupid, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trust me.
- Our band name. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We're like try to brainstorm
a bunch of fucking band names </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and nothing just seemed
to click because nothing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything sounded either like too metal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or too campy or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then we just went on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we just went with the name,
Nine and A Half Pounds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because the month before my mate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the lead singer went on a diet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he lost nine and a half pounds, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that was like, we were
just like, "You know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "We don't know what we're
gonna call our band. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Let's just use this as just the name </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "until we think of the
actual name for the band." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And then that just, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then that was just like,
- That's a amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - As with a lot of names </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it just sticks, right?
- You pick a fill name </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Can't be us a stranger now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you would just like play any song? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What kind of songs did you play? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - So I mean.
- Muse. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, just Muse? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I mean, we wrote our own songs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So we'd go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> So my mate had, we went
to the drummer's house </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because our drummer, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You always gather at
the drummer's house, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You always gather at
the drummer's house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause you can bring your fucking guitar, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you can bring your bass or
whatever to someone's house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't transport a drum kit everywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So at first we went to the
drummer's house to practice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then, and write songs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And eventually we had this really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like fucking old music studio
that friend of a friend </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> of a friend's dad owned,
you know that kinda thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's pretty cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you walk in, it's like a back alley </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like the fucking door hinges, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like when broken in 10
million times or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> And you're like, "I
might get stabbed here, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "but they have a drum kit
and a recording studio here." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right.
- It's so cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - So whatever, let's just,
- That's amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I remember the
biggest gig we played, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> was like, we signed up to,
what was the equivalent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of a battle of the bands kind of deal? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What the fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Bro, you had Anatomy Arc? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So like,
- This is just a Beck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, part of the reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why I got so into Beck
and why Beck was one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of my favorite.
- How the fuck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't you say this when
you were talking about band? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I did mention it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You did not.
- You didn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I must have mentioned this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - No.
- You didn't not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would remember if you were like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "By the way I was in a battle
of bands and performed," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I would remember the
name, nine and a half pounds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so we were just a band for fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We weren't taking this seriously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But we met like a lot of bands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who were fucking amazing
that came out of our school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I guess part of the other
reason why we formed a band </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was because we are, the school I went to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was a performing art school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So a lot of people there were doing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were doing performing arts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whether it was theater
or music or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So there were some people in my school, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like my classmates,
who were taking music, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really, really seriously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We were just like, "Whatever,
I'm learning guitar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'll just play in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'll just play in the band </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "because whatever, that
seems like a cool way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "to spend my time." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I remember for
this Battle of The Bands, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we literally had to do audition </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get into this battle of bands, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was a pretty big deal at the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because this gig was pretty famous </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like a lot of students. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there was like, there was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes there would even
be people from music labels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who would attend events like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's cool, though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So we weren't expecting
anything to come out of this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We were just like, "You know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "they're holding auditions at our school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "and we could sign up." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we're just like, "What
have we got to lose?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We didn't really.
- Yeah, why not? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We didn't really expect anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we didn't really think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we were that good of band. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we obviously auditioned
and it was literally like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the fucking X Factor kind
of thing, kinda deal, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Because.
- The big golden </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> buzzer in the middle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because literally we'd, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because our school was a performing arts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so we had like a theater set up, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And the theater, we had like
a drum kit in the middle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we had, there were judges on there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And we had to, we had to play two songs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We had to play two songs
in front of the judges. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember,
- That's where Garnt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> plays Plug in Baby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- And the crowd goes wild. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sorry, sorry.
- Now for our second song, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Plug in Baby. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> One more time, baby. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's where the montage starts,
everyone gets up on there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, they're gonna tell you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I remember we were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we were hearing some of our fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some of the other bands
that were playing before us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we were just like, "Fuck my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "We gotta follow these guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "We go fuck, we go fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "We gotta follow these guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I remember thinking,
"we're not gonna get on." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because there were a lot of other bands </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that were fucking better than us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna say that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But so we went on, we
just played our songs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The judges you know,
waved us off, whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We didn't expect much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so we didn't get into
the Battle of the Bands. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> We actually became like a backup choice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just in case, just in case, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so we went on with our lives </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then we get a call, like
a week before the events. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they were just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "So one of the bands is dropped out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "and we got an extra space in this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Battle of the Band's concerts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Do you wanna do you wanna come on?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And we're like, "what the fuck!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is literally Carole & Tuesday. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that's exactly what
happened in Carole & Tuesday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is an animate, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And so we were just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, yes, but how the fuck
can we prepare in a week? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> For this Battle of the Bands, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is like other
bands have prepared for, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like a good month or two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Playing with a band is
fucking much more difficult </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than you imagined it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you've never played in band before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because you're in a live setting, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And a lot of things can go wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you need to be on the same wavelength </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as your other band members. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We've had, I've played plenty of gigs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and some gigs are better than others. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes you make
mistakes, and sometimes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not in sync with
the rest of the band </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you need to be tight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You need like the performance
needs to be tight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you need a lot of practice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we said yes, but we didn't really, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we didn't really have
time to practice the songs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that we wanted to of practice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But there was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, there was like one joke
song that we had practiced, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we had practiced before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we didn't really
have any gigs coming up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just had sex by Lonely Island. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, it was an Indie rock version </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of Hit Me Baby One More
Time by Britney Spear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that's fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was Hit Me Baby One
More Time by Britney Spears. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And we were just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Well, we don't really
have time to practice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> "some of our more complicated songs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "So let's just put that in the set, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "whatever right, whatever right." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember we had the
conversation before of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> we always wanted the experience
of having the audience, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> having audience, seeing part of the song, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a lot of bands do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I remember we were
having this discussion </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of the perfect point
of this song would be, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> what's the line. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How does Hit Me Baby
One More Time, go again? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Camera Man] ♪ Baby,
hit me one more time ♪ </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think he's thinking
about the chorus, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh fuck.
- Hit me baby one more time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, I go again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no, no, here it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's when the line goes is my loneliness </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is killing me.
- Is killing me and yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we were saying that
would be an awesome point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> for like the audience to chime in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But we were just to do, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> do the, and to, to do the and diet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause that would be that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that would be like an
awesome feeling we thought. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But we were just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "no, we're not gonna do it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because like, what's more embarrassing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than stop because then stopping a song, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> letting the audience sing and,
- And no one sings. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And no one sings, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we did not have the fucking balls </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to do this, right.
- I've been there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so I remember we go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> the Battle of the Bands </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's like the biggest audience so far. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Normally we're used to performing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for like 50 to a hundred people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So this was like,
- Which is still a lot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which is still a lot,
you know, which is a lot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But this was like about 500 people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was at like Concorde
2, which if you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and if you know Brighton, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Concorde 2 is actually
one of the biggest venues. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's not like the Brighton, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's not the main Brighton venue. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a lot of big Indie bands go there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so we go on stage
and we're just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Guys, we're not gonna
take them seriously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "A lot of these bands are fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "We're just gonna have fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "We're just."
- Which is so anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- "We're just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "we're just going to have fun, right?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember, so we go on stage, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we play the set and this is
me playing on pure adrenaline. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we're not practiced at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're not as tight as we want to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in terms of our performance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I'm seeing like, for some reason, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just playing in front
of the biggest crowd, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kinda like hyped us up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I can't really explain the feeling, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it just like something
that day just clicked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know some days where
you're just like in the zone? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That day, for some reason, all
of us were just in the zone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We were like at peak performance, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I remember we decided </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we were of meme it up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we were decided we were
going to end it on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hit Me Baby One More Time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The rest of it was just
going to be our original songs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we were gonna end it on that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we were just like,
"we don't care, whatever." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The audience is probably
not gonna like it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause it's fucking Britney Spears, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we're just gonna have fun with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I remember when
we start playing the song, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somehow the audience
just like erupts, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The cause this is not the type of audience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that would listen to
fucking Britney Spears. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're here for like Arctic Monkeys, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're here for Block Party or you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> The Clarks or some shit like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember playing this song. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And obviously, we had
agreed that we weren't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to stop the music
with The Anri, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But you saw, we saw
the energy in the crap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing)
- You had no choice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And we were like, it was such a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was one of the most
surreal moments in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where we had this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we had this performance where
we were just all like in this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We were in flow, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We were just in, we were like
Karaoke basket in the zone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember the moment was coming up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I looked over, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I looked over at the drummer.
- Over the drummer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's so adamant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> We all look at him.
- We all at the drummer. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no, no, cause I remember, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, "I want do this." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But we agreed that we wouldn't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I remember, I remember thinking </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna do this.
- Do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I remember looking at the drummer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he had like the same look, as I did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing, clapping) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I looked over the bases
and the bases just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then, he nodded at me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, I looked over to the
singer and in the corner of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> he sees me, on the corner of my eye, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the corner of his eye. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then he nods back and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, it's going to happen." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so he goes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ♪ My loneliness is killing me ♪ </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Silence. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ♪ And I ♪ </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And like the fucking entire
concert hall, just like fucking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They complete the line. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's just like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't explain, that fucking feeling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It is.
- It's better than sex. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is like the biggest orgasm, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing)
I've had in my life, like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - For Sydney. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause it was, I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was kinda like a Disney moment for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause like somehow everything
just fucking came together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then we just, we
could continued the song </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was the best,
like the best reaction </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we've ever got from a crowd. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So the Battle of the
Bands was done by votes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there were 10 bands there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We came in third. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh wow.
- Oh shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you get anything, any prize? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, we didn't get any prize.
- Oh fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We didn't get any prize. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But that would. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They did get the biggest
orgasm of his life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That, that was the peak of my. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Music career. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was the peak of my music career. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It all went down from that.
- I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that's pretty ridiculous considering this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How many hundreds of bands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that have probably never experienced that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - True. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And from that down onward, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he relinquished the name Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He became gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He wasn't right to use the name really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like Leveled Up and Evolved. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, they can't use the name anymore. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> That must be crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> How the fuck have you
never brought this up? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did you never brought this up? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, I just. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I swear, I've said, "I've
been in a band before." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And no one's ever just. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone's been in a band before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> No, everyone's been in a band before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've been in a band for like 10 seconds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until I realize it's horrible idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I dunno that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, that's why I've
really liked Beck because I'm, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I looked up Beck and I'm
just like, "Fuck, I get that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I get that."
- That's my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you were actually good at guitar? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like competent at guitar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, you've played in front of people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's pretty good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've played in front of people, but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean that's, I've in my
mind, but that's pretty good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So we're starting a band
called 10 and a half pounds soon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 10 And a half.
- I look forward to you guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You like unlocked memories in me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I heard the Zelda (blabbers)
thing when you were like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I remember I tried to learn guitar. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What I tried?
- All right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think my parents nudged me towards it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right.
I just remember being </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in someone's house playing guitar, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> trying to do twinkle, twinkle little star. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right.
- I just was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I dunno.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, "I don't get this." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he was like, gave me
this device that was a tuner, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but I didn't know what it did. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He was like, "You gotta do
it, until it goes green, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> "the light."
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I was like, "why?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "It all sounds the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "It all sounds very similar." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just one beep to one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And my parents bought this tuna for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> even at that time when
I was eight, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Why my parents just wasted
their money on this tuna? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm never gonna get good at this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm never gonna good at this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> So I'd never, never learned guitar. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then I remember I went to learn drums, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> which seems pretty fitting
for me cause I'm, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, you just need a
sense of rhythm, that's it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And hand eye coordination.
- Which is great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've had great hand, eye coordination. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Unfortunately, no rhythm. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So that was the crux of that one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And that was over with it, and
I never really learned drums. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I went for like a year and I
never really learned anything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Really?
- They try to meet, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they try to teach me how
to read the Sheet music. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Ah.
- Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that's where I was like,
"No, I don't wanna do this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like jazz drumming methods. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I didn't enjoy it.
- I think, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I stopped learning at the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when cheap music started to
become a thing of my lessons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "I don't like this anymore." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This used to be fun
when we were just talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about beeps and boobs, now
you brought reading into this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what I draw the line. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because like I, I
think we said this last time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> where I go by feeling
and that's what I went </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I wrote the songs.
- Animate Protagonist </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you ever said.
- Cause I don't understand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a single thing about fucking music theory. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know which chords sound nice in my head. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And sometimes I have like a nice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like beat or rhythm in my head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Let's try to play this out with guitar." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I do not wanna know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what fucking music theory is.
- You're literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Yuri from K-ON, like a 100%. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like in the way you think
is 100%, it's exact same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "I can't read shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> "I just feel, and I complain." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember at one
point, for some reason, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> one of my friends was like,
"Yeah, we need to sing." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Ah, alright, I'll do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'll do it."
- Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "I'll do it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I couldn't sing at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't have any confidence in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> The first song, I'm not even kidding. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The first song that we had to learn, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is the only one I ever bothered learning. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We never did anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This died by this song. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Guess what song we had to sing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Muse song? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it was fucking Smash Mouth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing, clapping) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember like actually,
- why did you not pursue it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have like very vivid memories </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> of me actually, seriously
trying to learn how to sing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> fucking All Star before it was a meme. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And I remember when
this became a huge meme, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, "this is like
I had Nam flashbacks, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God, oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is the song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I need to hear it.
- Nam. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - An actual serious cover of Smash Mouths. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> All star.
- We go to karaoke. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, we,
- Because every time you go, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> every time we go to karaoke,
of course, All Star comes up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like at least four or five
times throughout the night. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And every time, it's just kind
singing like a dumb voice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I want you to actually like be serious, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and like try and like view.
- If I seriously try and sing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel vulnerable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What?
- I feel open criticism. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't do that.
- No it's, no, no, I won't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I'm the clown it's safe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no.
- Safety. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Come on.
- I get that Connor, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I get that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm at something.
- No, you can't hide. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You can't hide.
- I'll hide behind my. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now that you've said that.
- I'll hide, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> behind my clown makeup,
thank you very much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now, that you said
that you have to do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So what's your first pick? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - That was my first pick, Muse. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God, it's been like four hours. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I mean Muse is one of the only bands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've also seen live as well.
- I didn't know Bradio, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> had such amazing hair look at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Bradio's got the best shit.
- Holy shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Michael Jackson's running for his money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> on that fucking Afro.
- Honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is like the early
days of Bradio as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Bradio like his Afro, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like now is fucking massive.
- It's huge, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - He looks like dinosaur.
- It's huge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I've also seen
Bradio alive as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean the reason I put
Bradio you up there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's because I discovered
Bradio with Sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> during a really tough and time trying time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in our lives, when like,
I was living in London, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> working for the BBC. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And every day like was like
depressing a shit of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, especially with
the computer that I had. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But for some reason, for some reason, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> no matter how down my day was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I put on a Bradio song,
and I am instantly happy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For just like the five minutes
or three minutes, whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I could just feel glad
and happy for a second. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it bad? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't remember which songs they've done, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> which animates they've done?
- They did Death Parade OP. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's it.
- They like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the like I thought it was that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't wanna say,
cause I didn't wanna look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as an ass-hole.
♪ Everybody ♪ </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> ♪ Put your hands. ♪ </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That song does hard.
- Yeah, I mean like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Goes so hard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was not only that song, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I remember what really
sold me on Bradio was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first time I heard that song,
of course it was a banger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone heard the Death Parade OP opening </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they knew it was a banger, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was actually
their music video, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause if you see their music video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like four dudes having
fun with the green screen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like got such this,
it's got such a charm to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because they do a, they do this a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with some of their music videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they're just taking a person like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to like either
replicate this anime opening </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because what they did in this music video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was they've tried to
replicate the anime opening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of death parades, just with a green screen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and four of them and
it was just using like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very basic cosplay and a green screen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and makeup and all this stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just, it's got
such a charm to them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it just shows
that, it just feels like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's four dudes having
fun, having a fucking blast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and not really giving a shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about what the world thinks
about them, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My other favorite music
video by them is a Golden Liar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, Golden Liar.
- Where they're just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's literally just like them on stage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're just having
the time of their life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's such a good song and
it's such a good music video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Such a good baseline as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh.
- Guys, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the funk in that baseline. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Whoa. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So good, so fucking good.
- Actually, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna listen to them? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- You should. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like you like
them, because they're. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, like the
rest of their discoveries </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is like nothing will be bangers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck, yeah.
- I haven't heard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> a bad Bradio song. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, before we move
on from Muse though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have a funny story or not a funny story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because I remember when I saw them live, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was in Thailand.
- In Chelsea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like I, I.
- They went to Thailand? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was when I was living in Thailand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was so fucking random. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I'd gone my entire life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being a massive Muse
fan living in England. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, and just never getting
the chance to fucking see them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at all because they never
performed when I was in England. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so, the first time in my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I actually got to see them perform, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was it in Bangkok, Thailand? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Like what the fuck?
- Probably good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So I remember like, I
remember thinking this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is this this real? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is so surreal that
I'm going to be able </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to see Muse in Thailand, out
of all the places in the world, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I could see Muse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I remember going to this concert </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where dragging Sydney
along, because of course, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though she wasn't as
big of a Muse fan as I was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I needed something to go with me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I remember like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this was like the highlight of my month, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I'm like, "Fuck me, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I get to see Muse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I get to fucking see Muse." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember, I remember
going to the concert </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I remember going to the stage </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just like eagerly
excited for them to come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I remember the
first band that came on, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was a band called The Ruse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The Ruse.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so that's R-U-S-E, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right?
- Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I forgot that they needed
a supporting band, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> So my first thought was, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have we just gone to the
wrong fucking concert? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is this some Muse concert? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Or is this a Ruse concert? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is this the tie knockoff of the Muse? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What's going on? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then they start playing and I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Okay, maybe they're just
gonna play one song." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they play the second song. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "okay, maybe
they're gonna play two songs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "and then Muse is gonna come on." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They play five songs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And after the fourth song, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, "have I
made a terrible mistake?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> "And we've just come to Bangkok,
Thailand, to see the Ruse." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh no, no.
(Joey laughing, clapping) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did they end up coming or? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But they did, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I kind of thank God.
- OK, thank God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I was just like, I
just remember thinking, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at first I was like, "You know,
maybe it's a sporting band" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then like four songs later. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I really hope, I didn't
just spend all this money </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to see a ducking knock
off Muse, band, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're juiced by The Ruse. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did they do that on purpose? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They had The Ruse, supporting The Muse? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe, maybe.
- Impossibly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - They must have done that on purpose. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They must have chosen
- Must have, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Them on purpose, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There's no fucking way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you're supporting artist,
you should change your name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You should change your name to Bruce. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And no reason why, just do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but.
- Don't copy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my homework too hard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would be breaking it, if I got there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like welcome The Ruse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Check the ticket
right now, check it, right." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause I literally went, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I literal had to go outside just to check, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that the main poster, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> said Muse.
- Muse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then like I was coming
in to see Muse perform. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I go outside and it is
like, "Yes, it is Muse." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Go back in, still the Ruse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Maybe they made
a mistake out front on the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "maybe they got the
letters wrong, I dunno." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would be breaking,
I would be breaking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, there's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I've seen enough knock off
things in Southeast Asia </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like, "Maybe they
just pretended to be Muse </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> "it's entire time." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's the Thai version of Muse. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> That thing is stubbornly funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God.
- But yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I saw them live and they were absolutely, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> absolutely fucking incredible.
- So killing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] I'm shocked, you
put the killers on here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you like more than the one song? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you like more than Mr. Brightside? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like.
- Ruby, Ruby? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey, Garnt] That's Kaiser Chiefs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, that is Kaiser. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's how little I
know about The Killers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - They sounds so similar.
- To be honest I, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to be honest, I only know Mr. Brightside. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do they have any other songs? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they have Mr. Brightside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Apparently their latest
albums really good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> They kinda launch like year, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually haven't
heard that latest album. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Listen, why are they on the list, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why are they on the list? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I think the killers
was my University life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My university life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was actually like already
into The Killers before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Mr. Brightside came to
takeover the UK scene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You were fans before they were popular. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well kind of, but they
also really just exploded </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> onto the UK scene with Somebody Told Me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was like,
- Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, that was real.
- That was like the first song </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that really exploded. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was already into
Indie rock at the time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And for the longest time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought they were a British rock band. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're like a Mormon
American's, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So like for the longest time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought that they
were a British rock band </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same way as like Arctic Monkeys were, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and a lot of other British Indie bands. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because they came out in that time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I didn't know they were from America, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they were like the one
Indie band that I listened to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still throughout university. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because the reason I stopped listen to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> listening to a lot of Indie music </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is because my band broke up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we all went to university. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But, I listened to The Killers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't know which
album is which songs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I know I listened to a lot of Killers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> See I'm drawing a blank right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just know I've listened
to a lot of Killers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the real reason it's on here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is not only because I listened
to them a lot in university, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's also the first band
that me and Sydney bonded over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh.
- Oh, so cute. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I remember, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, Sydney likes to quote a lot of songs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to a lot of people that
she hung out with, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And apparently she told me,
that the only time someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had completed a song
lyric that she had quoted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> instead of just being like Sidney, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what the fuck are you talking about? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Was when she quoted The
Killers to me via text, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she was, she just randomly said. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh shit.
- Somebody Told Me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not, Somebody Told Me, I Got Soul. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'd reply her back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck, fuck! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh man, I'm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I reply her back, fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And she was like, "Oh my God,
you're the ones Garnt I want?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- The absolute irony. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm drawing a black right now.
(clapping) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> What's the.
- It's like I Got Soul. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Then you're just like,
- I'm not a soldier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that the line? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like me trying to remember lyrics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it is I have a soul, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not I'm a soldier, I think.
- Cause I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like I got soul, soul, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not a soldier or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, like I said, I
don't listen to lyrics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I just, I just know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I just knows,
- But you managed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to quote back that one? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Huh? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the one line he
managed to quote back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's the one line
I managed to quote back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and she was like, "Well,
you're a Killers' fan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are the one.
- You are the one you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you are the first person.
- You took a very big gamble </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> replying with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You gotta look like a fucking idiot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm like, "What's wrong with Garnt?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> He said, "He's not a soldier
or something bizarre." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So The Killers holds a very, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, a very deep place in my heart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not only because I listen to The Killers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I am reminded of University life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but also because it's part
of the reason that I met </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and bonded with my
partner that I'm with now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cute.
- And I also saw them live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Bangkok, Thailand as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so weird.
- You sure you want this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So we saw The Drillers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we saw The Drillers live at Bangkok. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> We're just construction team.
- Supporting act, The Fillers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We saw The Drillers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember like the first,
I remember seeing them live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the first song that they
played was Mr. Brightside. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course.
- And obviously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mr. Brightside is.
- You gotta start us strong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is the song that
everyone, everyone knows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember it such
a surreal experience, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just hearing a song that I'd listened to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so much in my childhood. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was almost like it was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was almost like a weird outta fuck, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> outta fucking body experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where I had heard the song
that meant so much to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when at one point in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I saw them now at the age of 25, 26 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something like that, like way later. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it just like a wave of
just like, it was so surreal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause at what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a wave of memories and nostalgia, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but also like me living in the moment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so weird to describe
because just hearing them live </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and hearing, it was like
my life had built a up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to this one moment, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know.
- Beautiful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I'd never seen a band </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I loved so much as a kid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> later in life until that one moment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it was just such an
incredible moment for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I will never forget hearing Mr. Brightside </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the first time in life.
- A live. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] And then we
have a Michael Jackson. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I also like Vanilla. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (men laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so the reason that
Michael Jackson is on there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is because, so as a kid,
I went through a phase </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where I was.
- Yeah, you spoke about this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah?
- I think you have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really?
- I feel like I've. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> This is weirdly familiar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Garnt talking about it.
- On the podcast? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I dunno if I have
talked about it on the podcast, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but as a kid, I went
through this massive phase </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> where I was obsessed with Michael Jackson. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I was a aware.
- You've definitely said this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really, I dunno.
- I dunno if I've said it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in private to you guys or on the podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I went through a phase when I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just an obsess Michael Jackson kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think everyone's
gone through that phase </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> at least once.
- As a target, obvious once. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (burping, laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This was the, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This was before that phase. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But regardless of what his image was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or what happens later in life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there was, I think you know,
his music fucking slaps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, yes it's vanilla, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's a classic for a reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love the song, pretty
young thing, but it's so hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so hard to listen to that song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (burping) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like the lyrical content. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know how I like, they're
like separate the art artist? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- I do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But sometimes, it's
really fucking hard to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that song definitely didn't, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's one of those songs, I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Why, why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "This song is so good, but
why do it have to be ruined?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I literally cannot listen to
that song without being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "This is great, oh, no." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then you remember what it was about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, oh, fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - MJ, I feel.
- But so many was songs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are amazing.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - MJ is just one of
those artists that I feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you could be at any party
or any convention in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with any amount of people that could have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> completely different
personalities on everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> The moment of Michael
Jackson song comes on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone's unanimously like fuck it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's good, every song's amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think we talked about this before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't think we'll ever
see someone that had the reach </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or was as famous as Michael Jackson was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, you're surprised.
- He was famous by standing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I love that.
- Yeah, I love that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because part of the reason
I go into Michael Jackson </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> was because my dad actually introduced me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to Michael Jackson. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I remember he bought like a VHS </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> of the top 25 hits of,
- Holy shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it was a 25th anniversary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wish I had like a deep
story of every single pick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, I was like,
- This is, this is the reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had the picks, cause I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I dunno how to talk about the music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm just gonna talk about the stories. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Somebody's watching
like Slumdog Millionaire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like every single answer
has a goddamn 10 part back, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like flashback it is insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it's one of the weirdest experiences </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you go to the
countryside in fucking Burma </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or Thailand or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like they've never
experienced internet there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> They barely have electricity there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You go to the transit slide </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and even going in the middle of nowhere, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somehow there will be this one farmer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who will have this old
beaten up cassette tape </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like Michael Jackson Thriller. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course, everybody likes,
- And like they will, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they will not know a
single word of English. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're like, "Oh,
you grew up in England, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "you know Michael Jackson,
you know Michael Jackson's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Should I beat it?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, we're in the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "how has Michael Jackson, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "how does Michael
Jackson have this reach?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, he's the king of pop, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- For a reason. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, it's still like I'm thinking about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it still blows my mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Just how famous one person is.
- Yeah, that's right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I Think Thriller, even to this day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is most sold album ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Mm, you think so? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Look, I said I
think so like I have any idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Which is like stupid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] It sounds right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, by stupid, I mean like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the difference between Thriller </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything else is like stupid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- True, true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's insane. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, because like you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you could go to the bomb fucked
middle of nowhere in Japan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And there'll be someone like
decrepit 70 year old lady, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, putting rice in the rice fields </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and being like, "Oh Michael
Jackson, yeah, yeah" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I almost de crap it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This a piece of shit, old lady. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They're all useless. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Decrepit wasn't the right word. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This poor old lady, what's her problem? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wonder.
- I'm just tryna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> give you some rice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Which Joey will say, will
taste the same anyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It all taste the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, who just like
knows Michael Jackson. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like it's just,
- Yeah everyone knows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Michael Jackson.
- It's ridiculous thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like weird
to think how someone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> one person got this
famous to so many cultures </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and so many countries that
obviously had nothing to do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with the US or just even
listen to that kind of music </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the first place. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, Thriller is like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not putting like Thriller on there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is kind of putting like fucking Zelda </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or something as your favorite
video game of all time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I mean, it's one of, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's one of the most legendary out albums </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he's one of the most
legendary artists for a reason. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And,
- Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I was a weird Michael Jackson kid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I actually.
- Did you learn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how to moonwalk? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Huh? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you learn how to moonwalk? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I attempted to learn how to moonwalk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I could moonwalk at one point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Actually it's like bullshit.
- I could moonwalk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> at one point too, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Could you actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, genuinely, genuinely.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you figure it out by yourself or. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I watched YouTube video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I Think I watched YouTube video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I remember trying to
figure it out as a kid, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Trying to figure out
how the moonwalk works. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because.
- You know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like frame by frame on the video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just like analyzing the moonwalk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because as like a five, six
year old kid or whatever, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "I got this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Okay, this looks exactly
like Michael Jackson." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And it was only until like years later </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you YouTube existed
and YouTube videos existed, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did I realize that's this is not, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is not how you do the moonwalk, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was doing it wrongly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was just walking backwards. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Literally, I was just like
walking backwards the inside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm thinking I look cool as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> No, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I tried to do like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the leg like pop thing that he does. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah.
- I tried to do that as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Tried to do that, and
almost dislocated my knees. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, "Ahhh." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like, Joey became a
pensioner there, he was fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like, "Oh, is
that why he shouts ahhh? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because it just fucking hurts, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Are these Japanese artist? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hold on, just frothing
over Michael Jackson's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just frothing up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So then you can add
that to the compilation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of Garnt tries to drink
like a human being. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I guess, this is with the Mayo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But this is more of where I put her in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because I feel like
she's a genre of music </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I have just recently gotten into. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And as with everything in my life, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> somehow, everything always comes back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to your Domestic Girlfriend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh what the fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing, breathes loud) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's almost like I was
born for this moment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As I always does, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I'm not sure what
this genre of music is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's not really just J-pop it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's more of like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, so how I would describe it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do you guys know what Utaite? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, of course.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So Utaite is like, I
believe singers or musicians </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who mostly originated
from Nico Nico starting, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who started off doing a lot
of Hudson named Nico songs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and stuff like that.
- Just like covers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, covers and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So a lot of these musicians who
came from the scene ended up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like, I guess,
graduating and just made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> started making their own songs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with their own original artists. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's this, I
dunno what the genre is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's a lot of artists in this genre </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I got introduced to by the
Domestic Girlfriend opening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause it's the, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Domestic Girlfriend is
a very divisive show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know that.
- Really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The opening fucking slaps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the opening's amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The opening is fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know the opening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not gonna even be able to attempt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to say it.
- Yeah, it's harder. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not like the catchy
song, it is just a banger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right?
- It's like (burping) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'll take your word for it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And that's how I discovered
that artist, Minami. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And Spotify recommendations, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> YouTube recommendations. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Of course.
- So I got really, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> really into Minami and her songs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from the Domestic Girlfriend opening. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that kind of
introduced me to this world </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of artists like Zutomayo, Eve. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Who else is fucking? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yorushika, I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, Yorushika, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so how I describe them is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> they are anime music
that don't have an anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they play to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Again, I've listened to this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't know their name.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But if you go to my YouTube, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> you can see I've listened
to this person a lot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just like that genre of like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm making the anime in my head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing)
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm making this up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So like a lot of these
artists that I listen to now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> have now been picked up for
like animate openings, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I remember I got into, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got into Zutomayo and
then I got into Eve. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I remember listening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to the Jujitsu Kaisen's
opening, when that came out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For the first time in my life, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, "oh my
God, I know this band." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know it cause I've never
heard this song before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But they have such a distinct style </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I had that moment
where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "I've been following them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "since they were
underground motherfucker." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I said, I read The Manga, fuck it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, you're right.
- He waved that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> in front of Jujitsu fans so fast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like I know this song. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it is the equivalent of the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've read this when The
Manga wasn't big, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because you know, because
there are so many artists </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in this field that have now been picked up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for anime opening or ending and like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there is this, there's
this feeling of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yes, you have music slaps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm fucking proud you." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm validated for being a fan of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was like that with Tosite Sigure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like before they became
the cyclo pass opening </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of the Tokyo Ghoul opening, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "I knew them before those." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey, Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn, you before the movie? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Before they're animate.
- But then, also a little sad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because now everyone knows Eve as, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, it's the Jujitsu Kaisen band?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, "No, they're
not just the Jujitsu." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's so much more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's so much more than that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Listen to the rest of their fucking songs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So yeah, I mean this is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess that's the kind of
music I listen to the most now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like really?
- Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like my Weib kind of.
- It's really big in Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> right now, especially like
Zutomayo and Yorushika </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're like, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Daft Punk, I'm supposed to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> a Daft Punk
- Daft Punk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't know, you're
a big Daft Punk fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am, I was a big Daft Punk fan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> during like the Discovery album, actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm thinking back and
a lot of my favorite songs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> or a lot of my favorite music </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have visuals to accompany them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like do you guys, do you guys, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When you guys listen to
a song, do you guys like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do you guys imagine a music video </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in your head or anything like that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sometimes, yeah.
- Depends on the song for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I usually like what I'm doing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like for me, if I can't connect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to a song unless I can
imagine kind of story </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or some kind of visuals
to accompany that song. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel like, I have
such a random song, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have such a random
music taste because to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really listen to lyrics, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but if a song emotes an emotion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or a visual image in my head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then that's when I get really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> emotionally connected to a song, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And to me, how I discovered Daft Punk, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was I discovered it
through Intastella 5555 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which was a fucking amazing movie, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's also one of the few albums </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have listened to all the way through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> based purely from that movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And from then on,
from watching that movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and seeing the story that
they crafted from that movie, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every Daft Punk song I listen to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I have such cool visuals
that go along in my head </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why I became such
a massive Daft Punk fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did that even happen? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Was it literally just the guy listened to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and was like holy shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I gotta make an animate to go with this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know exactly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think Musk Muto Deji
was like a fan of Daft punk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then they just worked
something out and then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause it's so good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so good.
- Would like to know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would like to know like,
what kind of like fucking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do I have to do to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Musk Muto Deji to make music? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, how did that connection happen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't even know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause this was before
anime was even close to big. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This was, this was like
on the ground is fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you have a favorite
song from the album? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Mine always changes quite often. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - From, it's hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - From Daft Punk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's probably Harder,
Better, Faster, Stronger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's good song. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, for me, it's like,
I know it's the vanilla pick, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but like One More Time
will always be there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - One More Time is amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - One More Time is great.
- One More Time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> with Digital Love. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just finished </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the Digital Love.
- My two favorites. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Digital love is fucking incredible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Digital love is amazing.
- Digital Love's very amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I think the reason I picked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> was because I remember when
I first started getting to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> AMVs and everyone tried to
make LinkedIn Punk AMVS. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did nothing, but just
make Daft Punk AMVS. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was me, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was like eve, the rest.
- I already made an AMV. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The rest of YouTube went through that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The rest of fucking YouTube went through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a LinkedIn Punk phase. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was here just like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like the entire
Discovery Channel in anime form </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aside from like, not even the movie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but just like in Naruto
clips and or shit like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - And when you heard the,
the Kanye West remix. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> That song, you're just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh my God." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's how I heard that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before I heard the original Daft Punk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right, I discovered
Kanye through that song. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Huh? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like, "why? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Who's this guy?"
- That song grew up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was like, "who's this guy
wrapping over a DF punk song." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And then that's Kanye West.
- Ah, so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, at first I hated that song </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Why would you ruin
Harder, Better, Fasteer." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then like, the more I
listened to it, the more I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Alright, this fucking slaps."
- Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kanye, alright. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're a crazy motherfucker, but. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - He's gonna get big. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can feel it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think this guy's gonna do stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think he's gonna be quite noodle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And Arctic Monkeys, is
obviously British staple. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, obviously, again, I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've already talked about my Indie phase. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've kind of just, it
wasn't just Arctic Monkeys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just,
- Everyone born around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> our generation ish, British
loves Arctic Monkeys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because if I would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to say,
- Very normal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I would have to say what my, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what influences I took when, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was in my band, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It was bands like Arctic
Monkeys, The Klaxons, Strokes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who else was like big at that time? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Razorlight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh wow, Razor I fucking love that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also like Red Hot Chili
Peppers and Foo Fighters as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just like, just like any.
- Everyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Any Australia around that
time, White Stripes was massive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, White Stripes as well, fuck it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Yes I fucking loved the White Stripes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean that slot is just there for, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just for just mid 2000s. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bruce Check, Bruce Check?
- Yeah, Bruce Check. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bruce Check, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Bruce Check. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then you got Pillows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I got The Pillows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, I put The Pillows there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because I did go through a phase </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where there was a lot of
anime music on my playlist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Actually, we've all been there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Come on.
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've all been there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey was the animate man at one point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Good old times. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But back then, I didn't like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't look up the bands
behind the anime music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just anime music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And.
- My apple thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was TV size bracket. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A lot of one minute 30 songs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, of course.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I remember Fooly Cooley
was the first entire OST </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that I've like, I took this entire OST </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause every song in the Fooly Cooly OST, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was basically just
The Pillows album, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was just an album of The Pillows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was the first time where
I took an entire anime OST </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and put it on my MP3 player,
which wasn't even an iPod. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like this like.
- An actual league MP3 player. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like a knockoff cheap ass </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Chinese MP3 player that I
can't even remember the brands. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because.
- Probably, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it doesn't exist anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it probably doesn't exist anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because I couldn't afford proper iPods </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or proper branded MP3 player. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I had one that was kinda
like shaped like a long pill. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like a blue pill. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, and. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then you could
put like an ox-corner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like tiny, tiny screen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and the name of the song will like scroll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> across the screen.
- Same, same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh good times.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Kids will never understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I mean like The Pillows, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it is again kind of just like Japanese, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but also has certain like,
- I was this close </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to putting The Pillows
on mine, but I didn't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Again, like the reason I
really loved that soundtrack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is because FLC is kind
of just like an AMV, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but just in animate form.
- Six season goods AMV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is the second season good? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's good, but nowhere near as. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not as good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never watched it.
- It's not as good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It has its moments.
- You gotta watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the first one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But its like to me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like 90% of why I love Fooly Cooly so much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was cause of The Pillows. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And the visuals were kinda like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it was kinda like watching
Intastella 5555 again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm.
- So if you like the music, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you'll like the anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah.
- What if you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into the music? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's gonna be hard to
not be into the music. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, I get.
- I mean it kinda sets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the tone of the entire show.
- That makes sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's a reason why
it's one of the most famous </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> anime OST.
- All right, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> People never shut off about Fooly Cooly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and why it's so amazing and why should. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's moments like
this where I was afraid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> whenever people were just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Yo, well, let's pass your Score. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Let's see what your music taste is." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm just like, "Fuck man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> "How am I going to explain, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "yeah like TV size, Naruto opening five?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, "What is that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> "What is that?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but at least it was like you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> hard, Cut & Dried, like J-Rock, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was listening to like Lucky
Star opening with people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, "That's
even harder to explain." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like past The Yonks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "I don't think
you want The Yonks, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I definitely listened to too much, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Hannah Montana at one point.
- Really. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - More than I.
- What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - More than I care to admit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hannah Montana?
- You always saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like Best of Both, was?
- Then I was so obsessed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> with Hannah Montana.
- Best of Both </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was an amazing song.
- Yeah, was good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ♪ Best ♪
When I was like 13, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was obsessed with Hannah
Montana and I dunno why. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So much to say, that one of
the first books I ever read </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> was Miley Cyrus's autobiography. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing)
- Are you serious? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not kidding. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not kidding, I wish that was a joke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wish that was those String of Rose. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're a hardcore Miley Cyrus, fan? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For some reason I was
obsessed with the Disney Shower </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I was like 12 or 13. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That makes sense, though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I was sold on the dream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can do whatever you wanted to do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I realized that no,
it's not how it works. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Let me sat this
- And then you saw, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you saw how
Miley turned out, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, it was a little. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> (chuckles) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like there was just Selena
Gomez Women's Much Better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Switch Gears. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, Much Better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm done with it this,
so what do you meme? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I dunno. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I dunno why I just liked it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And also I like the music for some reason. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought that was,
- It's weird how, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're 12 and 13
you're just fucking idiot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was more obsessed with Hillary Dolph. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughing)
- Hillary Dolph? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, like more of the, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why?
- Isn't it weird, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I used to have those phases? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, Miley didn't really click for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Hillary, I was like, "Yeah,
I can get behind this." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like everyone has that one thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they've shoved down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and their subconsciously has pressed it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they're like, "I never like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "If you say I did, I did not." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so in-explainable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Now that I think about
it, I was like, "Why?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Dude, why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't,
- Did I like Hillary Dolph? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I cannot explain to you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> why I like this?
- Was she like hot to me? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think I like the
escapism that it offered. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that could be it.
- When I was like 12 and 13. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Copium or something, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I dunno why?
- Copium. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 12 Year old copium.
- What's wrong with me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And now I'm this jaded British
man who likes beans on toast. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> But back then I had dreams and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Business Channel.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] What the happened to you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (blabbers, chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Anyway?
- Animate does that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> animate does that too, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Destroys dreams. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, that is my three by three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I dunno if that's like random as fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- It makes sense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean like.
- It's gone, it's gone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like I've talked
more behind the stories of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the stories of.
- I just wanna hear </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> more about you being in a band now. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> in the band to be continued. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh my God.
- How am I suppose </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> to live up to that?
- Who's gonna be next. </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, he's gone on a TV show? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> He look, I feel like I've seen him on TV. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Tommy Hawk, been on a TV show? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sure, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To be honest, can we Google that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Am I going crazy? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe, I don't know
- Can I even guess? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Please. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll be surprised if
you can get anyone else. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, that's Tool. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yes.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck, why do they all look the same? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is this a British Bands? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It could be like The
Who or The Sex Pistols </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or it could be one of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not Who or Sex
Pistols, but it's that era. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I feel like
they all look the same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, I'm British they all
look exactly the fucking same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - That is true.
- They do, they do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, so from left to right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we got Tool, Led Zeppelin.
- Okay shit, that one was just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna kill me.
- Radiohead, Tangerine Dream, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Pink Floyd, Nick Drake, MF Doom, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> American Football and Might June. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - My brother's gonna kill me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He actually is obsessed
with like Led Zeppelin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really?
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he was obsessed with them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll be his friend
- He loves all of those. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That era bands, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he know them really well.
- I could have put like nine, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just '70s hard rock bands
as well, if I wanted to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But,
- Cause, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I love a lot of the music,
but a lot, at the same time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I have no idea what any
of the band's look like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like you know.
- That's what they look like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> They all look like long hair. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like Led Zeppelin, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I know what Aussie Osborn looks like now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey, Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know what he looked like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - He kind of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Boy, he looked so different back then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, y'all Aussie Osborne
actually looked like a human. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Poor 80 year old Japanese, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> so now that the Aussie's getting dragged, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> to be fair, Aussie is aged strangely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, when I saw him live, it was weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Aussie is like, you know
those time lapses of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this chicken nugget, has been
in the closet for 70 years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and hasn't aged, but it has. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's how I feel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why, is
that a fact comparison? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's how I feel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, "It shouldn't be alive, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "but it looks worryingly well." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Aussie now kind of looks
if someone took Aussie Osborn </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and deflated him and then
reinflated him again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's the one who's done.
- He looks like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if someone took Aussie
Osborn and just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> he left him in water for too long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing, clapping) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Poor Aussie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He had like, just hasn't he
done like an insane amount </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of drugs or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, he should've
- I mean most. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He should have died ages
ago, normally, but he some, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, that's why he can barely talk now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's crazy.
- Like when I went to go see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Black Sabbath live, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was like you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the original lineup.
- I'm surprised </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's still performing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, this was like
maybe five, six years ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was labeled there Last Tour, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like, "Of course I have to go." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's impressive, that
he's still able to perform. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well that's the thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, he came out from. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When they all came onto stage </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the music starts playing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you just see this guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like hobbling
across the stage, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, "Oh, that's him. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "There he is." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he just goes up to
the mic and he is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "How's y'all, how you doing?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That is normal for Birmingham. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What you talking about? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "Ooh."
- Sorry, I break again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "I don't know what you saying man, but, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> "God, you sounding good." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he is like, "Oh, I'm
good but what's this job, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, I think you know it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "General's gathered." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he just starts singing normally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Why can you not? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> "Why can you sing completely fine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "But you can't talk normal." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the, you haven't
lived in the UK test. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I can understand him like perfectly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not even joking. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (cameraman laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I could understand what he was saying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know what it is, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The UK is weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's such,
- It doesn't make sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It gives you like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like the hard mode of English, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what I mean?
- I feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Once you're trained
in it, then you could, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you could like distinguish any accent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, difficulties
understanding English accents. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause I just grew up
around really strange ones. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I guess like Black Sabbath, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like sorry, Led Zeppelin for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is kind of just all of the
British, '70s hard rock, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like Black Sabbath can fit in there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like Deep Purple can fit in there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause like that's just
like the music my dad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just grew up with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was like here, "Do
you know, Rolling Stones?". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, and I was
two years old and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> "What is a music?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then he just played Rolling Stones. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was like, "Okay,
I can get behind this." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then I think the first
band I like really connected to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> was Led Zeppelin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like I fucking love every song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, I'm gonna, I'm like an idiot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Are they the ones who
did Stairway to Heaven? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, they are the ones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> who did Stairway to Heaven.
There's no way I could get, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that one wrong
- Stairway to heaven, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Rock and Roll, Black Dog, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Immigrant Song.
- Immigrant Song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you know that song? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> The one that goes like,
(blabbering) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah I get, I listen to that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Viking song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they're the ones.
- Yeah, The Viking song, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that's them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I often living in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll meet like, let's
say, you're just me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talking to Japanese people, whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they'll be like, "Oh,
I love British music." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll be like, "Oh, okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm thinking like, "Fuck, watch Era, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "they gonna talk to me about it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I don't know any of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's always like Black
Sabbath, Led Zeppelin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they'll be like, they'll ask me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, what's your favorite song?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll be like, (breathes deep) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Stairway.
- Stairway to Heaven. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is where I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is where like my bullshit
levels come into like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "how well can I do this?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, this.
- This is really wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But basically like, Jimmy Page, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Who's the guitarist for Led Zeppelin, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> he's the one who basically
influenced me to start guitar. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So I watched one
concert from Led Zeppelin </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I was like, "That is the
coolest fucking human alive." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Just like him just shredding on guitar, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "I want what
he has, I want that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "Can I do that?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it a coincidence that
we're all posing very similarly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And they just happen to all
have the same looking post. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, that's
just like, we are a band. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - We are a band, we're doing pretty well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we are a band. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is he holding a door? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's behind the door.
- He's behind a door. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing)
- He's not holding a door. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He's not holding a door </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> in this thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's just holding door.
- I'm taking this home. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm taking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so I guess like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so Led Zeppelin is just like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Just my love for like '70s rocks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So like Black Sabbath, Deep
Purple, Rolling Stones. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause like the,
- This must have been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really hard for you to decide.
- It's really hard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cause your music knowledge is vast. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it is.
- And I feel like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> you have an appreciation
for music way beyond </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anything me and Garnt have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, for like me and
Connor like a music puddle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yours' like a music ocean.
- You're right, basically. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I guess like
kind of in the same vein, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> but I had to like put it,
differently as Pink Floyd </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in the middle. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right.
- You love them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think I went to a
concert of Pink Floyd's. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Well, technically just Roger
Waters and he performed there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Pink Floyd has this album called The Wall. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, good take though.
- Which is considered like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> one of the greatest concert albums. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey has explained The
Wall to me in great detail. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like how you said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> "They made this album called The Wall." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The Wall.
- Like it's not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one of the most favorite.
- I don't know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The favorite albums there.
- Because people always think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like, "Oh yeah, they made
dogs out of the moon." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, okay.
- That's the one I knew. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, is that the one that
Nostalgia Critic's made, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, my favorite, Nostalgia Critic's. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I love them.
- I love that album. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's amazing.
- Amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I fucking I Nostalgia Critic's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But so Roger Waters was the guy who like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mostly wrote The Wall. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the entire band did it as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But he went on like a tour all
around to perform The Wall. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so I got tickets to it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like miraculously from a
friend of mine and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh my God, my dream's
gonna fucking come true." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I get to see one
of my favorite bands. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it wasn't a concert. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a Stage Show.
- Huh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - So again, the whole
concept of The Wall is like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> guy creates a wall,
that's like not physical </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then he breaks it down
to get over his musical </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and emotional bears. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Super oversimplifying the album. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, thank you.
- That's what I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Strait run.
- But what's amazing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what was amazing about
that concert is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> as they are playing the
songs throughout the album, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're literally physically
building a wall on stage. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, that's cool.
- That's cool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - With like, it not obviously
not outta bricks, but like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like big, like Styrofoam Bricks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's cool.
- So like after every song, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> the band members actually
like go off the stage </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like place bricks on the wall. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's cool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then, in the second half, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then in the first half of the album, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he finishes building the wall </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it just goes into an interlude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it funded by Donald Trump. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He was like, "I want it taller." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then, the second half
the wall is built, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But they build it in front of the band. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So as the concert is going on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can see less and less of the band. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's so cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then the second
half of the album starts, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the entire stage spins around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why we're looking for them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And so now you're looking
from inside The Wall. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Huh.
- Huh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then, because that's the theme </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the second half of the album. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then at one point in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at the end,
- How the fuck </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> do they spin the stage? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was all just on this like giant, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like Lazy Susan Esque,
like just rotating thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Huh.
- Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then, like the second
to last song on the album, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the main protagonist of the
album, he breaks down The Wall. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they literally like blow the shit up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's so cool.
- Just the pieces, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just go flying into the crowd. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's fucking cool.
- And then, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the album just stands. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I've never cried during a concert, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but that was the first
time I was like crying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was one of those
concerts where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know normally, like
say if you go see Muse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like Pendulum, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- You're like standing up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> you're like grooving,
you're singing along, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're like fuck, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You know like that kind of thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That was the first ever concert I went to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> where I was just like
my ass firm only planted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the seat and just staring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Yeah, I appreciate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - And just listening and taking it in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's like,
- I wish I could have that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it was,
- I wish I could have that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was crazy, it was like one of the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I've been a lot of concerts in my life, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but that was like one of
the most like ethereal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like the only way I could describe it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It was just so like, oh
my God it's so magical. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, as someone who doesn't understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of like the deeper appeal of music, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like what makes The Wall
such an amazing album? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because to me, The Wall is
just like the album you say, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you want to impress a dad, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know like you meet,
- That's true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You meet your girlfriend's
dad or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh what music do you like?"
- Cause it's like Craft Juliet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I like.
- I love The Wall. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I love Pink Floyd, The Wall. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And like easy fucking
bragging points, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, of course, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I love IPAs, I love that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - IPAs, I love The Football, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I do love IPAs.
- And I love The Wall. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, so I did like a whole
dissertation on The Wall. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Huh? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did like a fault, so I
took music is like a major </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> in high school.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause I wanted to like pursue it at Uni. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Obviously, I didn't end
up pursuing it at Uni. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your dad's were like, "No,
no you're Asian, Jerry." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, like, no,
way you're gonna do it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you're gonna do it right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And one of like I did, I
studied like musicology, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> which is just like music
analysis basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they were like, and like
the yearlong dissertation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was take an album and just
write a dissertation about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like write an album, write
an album review, basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I wrote this like 40 page,
dissertation on The Wall. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, what's the most
insane thing about The Wall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like not just the fact
that the story is cohesive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all the songs flow together? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hmm.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There is no pauses
between any of the songs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as it flows from one song to another, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the entire album is connected
to just one big song. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> But the most amazing,
like mind blowing thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is the fact that the album
literally repeats endlessly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's cool.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So the end, the ending of the last song </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> fades into the beginning
of the first song. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's really cool.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And that just completely like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's not just a stylistic thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- They did that on purpose </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to show that like what this
main character is going through. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Is a never ending cycle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's just never, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just constantly
repeating over and over. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Tyler created that as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with one push album.
- With Eagle, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Eagle did that as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So The Wall was, I'd
say was the first album </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> to incorporate that style and a lot of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously like Tyler and like
a lot of artists took that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, you know I've always said that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can make a concept heavy album, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And try and tell a story. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But if the music sucks,
then the music's gonna suck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No one likes the song because. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's you could have the most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like deep ass message about like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whatever the you're trying to sing about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But if the song doesn't stick with you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> then it's like there's no point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The Wall though, it's like
every, song's a fucking banger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So even if you listen to
it individually, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, it's a fucking great song." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor, Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's it still slaps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then on top of that, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, it's deep as well,
and profound it's lyrics." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "What more could you ask for?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, awful and true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The one thing though that
annoys the fuck outta me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> is the fact that another brick in The Wall </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is from this album. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's like Pink Floyd's
most well known song. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just because, and I'm like, it's a Bob. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But so many people just
listen to it outta context. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - They don't know what it means. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because they don't know what it means. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because if you actually in.
- It's pretty me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because in the context of the album, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a really depressing song. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's just like played in an upbeat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's like a great song, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like I'm not gonna
fault them for that, but. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And like all their albums
are just like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They've never had a
bad album, it might be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> So there's that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know you love Radiohead an awful lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love Radiohead as does Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I do as well, he was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know he was burnt over radio. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey, Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember like, I had to
pick between Muse and Radiohead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was just like, Muse can slightly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just slightly edges them out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is there's any Radiohead
songs that I've heard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that have been like, "I love this song?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Have you listened to Creep? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't like creep that much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - The best song. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You guys always sing it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, I mean,
- This is like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like the songs.
- Cause it's the least </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> depressing Radiohead song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't really
like the depressing songs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the Weeknd thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause at least it's gonna not be right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He plays (indistinct)
- He always sounds bumpy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's cause I started
listening to the lyrics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not gonna do that
again, that was a mistake. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know like, I
think for me Radiohead, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what I appreciate the most
about Radiohead is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> they started off as
just like another '90s, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> alternative rock band. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And then, one day they were just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "No, I don't think I will. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "I don't think I'll be another
'90s alternative rock band. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna try something else. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Computer came out, and it was one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the most like revolutionary
'90s, rock bands ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, bands like Muse
listened to them was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "We can do that too." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I think I,
- And like the Coldplay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> as well was like heavily
influenced by Radiohead. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> All these like big, old
alternative rock bands </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that went a little experimental. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I feel like Radiohead
are the OG in that sense </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they are fucking incredible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And the only reason I
put Muse above them was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I think I discovered
them both around the same time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But there are so many nights where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just like conquered
just listen to Radiohead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't know it's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to me if I'm like having
an existential crisis, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I put on Radiohead, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause there's nothing that
just encapsulates that mood </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> more than just like a Radiohead song. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, "Sometimes I'm
just like, you know what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I just wanna stay home
and just feel depressed." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wish I could feel this
strongly about music, I did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember I was at a place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that was like classical music being played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's this guy, I was enjoying it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I thought it was amazing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Oh, this
guy's are so talented." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And there's a guy who's in the front </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I could see him
cause it was kinda like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, a good circle, like semi circle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I could see him. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was like tearing
up how good this was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember thinking like,
"Fuck, how did he do that?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did he. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - How does this mean so much to him? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or how did that make him feel this way? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I don't understand,
I like the sound a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I really appreciated
the artistry and everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, "Fuck man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "I wish I was able to
get what that guy had." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel.
- I felt like shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was he emotional? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - About from the music, like
really made him emotional. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can easily get that.
- I can't get that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think that's only, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I think there's only two.
- Am I fucked up? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think there's only two
artists in my three by three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that haven't made me cry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah, I dunno. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that weird that I can't? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think it's weird.
- I don't think it's weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wish I could get that to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To me I have a different problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause like I said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never know the deeper
meaning behind the music, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but like I've cried to so many songs, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have no idea what they're about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck.
- Cause they just make me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel things.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanna feel these things.
- Why do they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make me feel things? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I don't listen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what the lyrics mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, "Damn man, this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think like, have you
ever just like sat down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just listened to music? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, nothing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I guess nothing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but I guess you're listening
to like Daft Punk and shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I love the beat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's nothing like Digital Love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't necessarily gonna make you cry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, all right, you're right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess it's maybe the music I listen to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the way I consume it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, maybe I dunno. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But I don't think it's weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think there's a lot of people you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause I don't struggle to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> when I watch TV or anything, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like super easy, I cry all the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But there are people who like struggle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to cry watching movies.
- Yeah, it's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I guess it's the same thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not like I'm
sitting there like (burps) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Come on tears. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (moaning) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not there doing
that, it's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't get what this guy's getting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't understand why I, you maybe it's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know.
- No, no if. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe as I'm mature, I might. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me, music is, this's gonna
sound so philosophical now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's kinda like a language, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They're like,
- Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't speak it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It is like, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel like there is
something being communicated </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> through the language of music and like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even understand
the words behind the music, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I feel, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There are times when I think
I feel the language behind it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and like the emotion that
being portrayed with the music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so fucking weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, if animals or anything to go by, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, dancing is a language, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> singing is a language,
somehow they don't understand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but I imagine what they're
saying, but it does something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's how they
decided they, some animals </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just pulls out, like
just some kind of primal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah, you're right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think we have an
inclination to a feel towards it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> under where my, I fucked it up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know what makes, I
don't what makes good music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what makes
good music, like literally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think what makes good music is just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if it makes you feel a certain way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I watch like musical memes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like memes that only people who like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or are really into music would get. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I feel like this is funny." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just didn't, I just couldn't
understand why it was funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll be like when somebody plays C minor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> or something like that
and I'll be like, "what?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But yeah, that was kind of funny. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a bit of a
deep cut, but you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't if it is,
something along those lines. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then I guess Tool
is probably the one band </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that made me love metal again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because like I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Twain Long in the songs? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (burping) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The name sounds extremely familiar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, they
- Yeah, cause Joey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> used to talked about them
- Cause I used to talk about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's okay, that's probably, why, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's probably, why. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Cause I talk about them all the time? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But, I think, well, speaking
of like primal instinct, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think like Tool does the
best job of like pulling out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> that primal instinct in
people when they listen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the music.
- I also I thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you were talking about that band. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no.
- I'm like Monkey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (blabbering) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like primal
instinct, I love that band. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's a band called
Primal Scream, which is good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But not primal instinct. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, I don't know like Tool is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think they necessarily </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have like a hit song or anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're kind of like one
of those just cult bands, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess maybe like the pot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sober, The Pot.
- Yeah, Sober, The Pot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Prison Sex, there's there's
a lot of like good songs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think what makes it, like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think what makes Tool amazing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what I feel love with Tool is that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially this is a band that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you need to listen to the lyrics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it's like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck.
- Fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not like it but what I
love about Tool is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> their music just in
general is so fucking good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that you'll still enjoy yourself without </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> listening to the lyrics at all. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So like Maynard James Keenan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who's this guy in the
middle, he's the lead singer. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> In his, in like Tool Stage
Shows and like concerts, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> normally the lead singer
is in the front, Right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But Maynard for some reason is
behind a curtain in the back. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like you can't even see him
half the time in concerts. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And that's because he treats his voice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> as just another instrument.
- I know that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And if you want to listen in, closely, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on what he's saying, then you can. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If you don't want to, you don't have to. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's the rest of the band to listen to. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I think that's like, so
fucking cool because it's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> again it goes back to
that whole thing of like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you might have like some deep
ass message behind your music, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but if your music sucks, then
no one's gonna listen to it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right?
- True, true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And Tool's like, we can make banger songs </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and we can make profound lyrics. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That makes sense. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And it's like, that's like I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just like musicians. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like, I inspire to be that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, like I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Tool is one of those metal bands, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that even non metal fans love. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think every person I've shown Tool, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who is like not necessarily
into metal music, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like, "Yeah, this fucking slabs." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh.
- So like, I'd recommend, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you don't like metal listen Tool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then, oh God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess we'll go to Dr.
Doom as Connor alluded to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - MF Doom.
- MF Doom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I knew that, I knew
that I shouldn't have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So MF Doom, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> As Connor said, is your favorite
Rapper's favorite rapper? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mm, I've seen that YouTube video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you've seen
that in YouTube videos? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've, he's like a legend. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've heard so much about this person, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I've never listened to their music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So basically like Tyler The Creator </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like you know, fucking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Literally every rapper, everyone
loves I and has gotten big, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> has been somehow inspired by MF Doom. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just because he's like, I dunno. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He's like the hiphop fans,
hip hop, if that makes sense? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, exactly.
- Because I feel like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> before MF Doom, the only hip hop </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I ever really listened
to growing up was Eminem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But that's because Eminem back then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like fucking inescapable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> During Eminem show era,
Eminem was everywhere, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I feel back then, I didn't
really take hiphop seriously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like rapping seriously,
other than Eminem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then I listen to MF
Doom, and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, hold on, this might actually, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "this might actually be good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "This might be some good music." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Again, another artist you
need to listen to the lyrics. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So.
- Yeah, I remember that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know who broke that music? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Vox or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Vox did a video on it,
- I think they did </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> break down the lyrics. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They did like an Elon video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - On and I was like, "This is amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "I just don't, I don't know." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I just,
- I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't think I could
ever garner this by myself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or even become close to
garnering this by myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, when they tell
you why the piano is amaz </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or this specific piano is amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, "I'm sure it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "It certainly looks the best." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, it makes sense, it makes sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it's just like
good music in general. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Again, I'm having a hard time explaining </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> why this is good to people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who aren't on the same wavelength. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, well,
- Well, luckily, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> any hardcore music fans here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can appreciate your taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure.
- You're right, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, well, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If we were more hardcore into music, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> how would you explain it then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I am curious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so.
- Break, it down for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Break it down.
- Break it, break it down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Focusing a 100%.
- Break it down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, so Tool, for example
is like just the sound </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and their singing style and
the way they structure songs </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it just has like a flow to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One song could have like
seven or eight different parts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that sound like seven or
eight different songs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But somehow they can stitch
that bitch up together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and make it sound so
cohesive and like together, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to the point where you can listen through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a 15 minute Tool song and
it'll sound like two minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I was gonna ask how
long is a typical Tool song? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - They're not actually too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, they obviously have
like long songs as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I think average Tool songs, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe like five, six minutes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's quite long. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which I guess is long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I mean like, if you
compare it to like say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, a Tangerine Dream song, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a standard Tangerine Dream song </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a good name.
- Yeah, so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never heard of them,
but that's a good name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So Tangerine Dream is this German group. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tangerine Dream?
- Yeah, Tangerine Dream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's a good statement you
don't have to say anymore. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a great fucking band name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So they're a German group that like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> does electronica and ambient music. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I put them there because
this is the one group, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I used to listen to all the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in school while I was studying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did you find out about this band? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, its incredible.
- My dad showed them to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, okay, I was gonna say this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Seems like very big.
- So basically every, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I reckon everyone except
maybe the bottom three here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I found out through my dad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So like he, yeah, he just. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he raised you well, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But he's proud of you.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So Tangerine Dream have been around, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they're still around, actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They've been around
like 60 years is almost. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think they've been
around since the early '60s </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're still going. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Cameraman] 1968. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking hell, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they're still, they're still going. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They have like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think they have like 400
studio albums or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> They have a big, big, big catalog. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's stupid amount
of albums they've made. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like basically they've revolutionized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like chill electronica,
meditation music, ambient music, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like perfect study material. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Huh.
- Because it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no lyrics.
- Better than Lo-fi better? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Better than Lo-fi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It should be that Lo-fi hiphop girl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it full shit?
- Lo-fi hip hop girl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> wishes they were Tangerine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like really good like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Tangerine Dream I would say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like perfect background music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you're at like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if you have like friends
over and you're just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just wanna like hang out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or you're like you know,
you have your fucking like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, fiance's parents over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And you don't wanna sound, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you don't wanna look
weird by putting on Tool </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the background, you know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Tangerine Dream is like the music to go. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right.
- Because it's just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just relaxing, it's
inoffensive, it's just. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'll check it out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, and they got a lot of good songs. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They did a lot of movie soundtracks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh really?
- Yeah, so, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Any movie song I know? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - There was this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What was the Tom Cruise movie </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that they did the soundtrack to? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Cameraman] Jack Reacher. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They did a lot of soundtracks though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like game soundtracks
as well that they're done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, what?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So.
- What kind of games? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wish I could tell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They've done, they've done 400 albums. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't fucking remember. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Camera Man] Risky Business?
- Risky business, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They did the Risky Business soundtrack. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is like probably
one of their best albums. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They literally just three German dudes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who play a lot of relaxing music. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Goddamn, they've got
a fucking work ethic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - They've gotta work ethic.
- Fuck me! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I guess Nick Drake is this guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who's that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - So Nick Drake is like,
so he's like kind of, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he plays folk music.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - As if you couldn't
tell from this picture. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But he basically. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's really hard to describe him. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So he basically, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> he killed himself very early in his crew. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think he was like 23, 24 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when he killed himself.
- Oh, Jesus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But he made this one
album called Pink Moon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's literally
just him and a guitar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- That's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like super Lo-fi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just him just like
singing just one guitar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Occasionally, maybe like a piano. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's so like, it's one of like, look, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it comes to depression,
as a theme in music. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A lot of artists have done it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like all sorts of different angles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In my opinion, Pink Moon,
is probably the most fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> hard hitting and like real album </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it comes to depression
and exploring depression. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What makes you to say that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's because it's not only
just the tone of his singing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and just the fact that
it's just him and a guitar, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But, again, it's like lyrics obviously. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He has this one song called, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think it's called Black Dog. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it inspired a book called Black Dog. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Great.
- Where it's like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> depression is like a black dog. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It just like keeps coming back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that's from the song that he wrote. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like it's beautiful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's like haunting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like really
really fucking haunting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And every time I play this album, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> this is like a couple
of songs that I just hit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm just like breakdown, crying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess, cause you
know the, you know what, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how real the stuff is.
- Well, when someone's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in that state of mind, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes it's like sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't always express yourself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or communicate that emotion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> without having a medium like
music or something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What I can say, is
that Nick Drake is music, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but what it's certainly
not is entertainment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is this.
- Or he has me pampered. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would dare say, it
really is the awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It is just like, it is music
in its purest artistic form. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, okay.
- Where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't put on a Nick Drake
album to fucking jam out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You put on a Nick Drake
album to self reflect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just kind of take it in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And kind of you learn from it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Because he was like,
he was super depressed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm talking like mega, mega,
mega depressed from a child. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I believe that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like it led him to take his own life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> even though he was like
extremely fucking talented. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He probably had a bright
future ahead of him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if he kept going, but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Depression was very hard to deal with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So then he just kind of gained </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a cult status because of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And my sister actually
like put me onto Nick Drake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because I guess she was
in a stage in her life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where she kind of was like in that mood. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like I found him
in like the perfect time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And again, this is not an
artist I would recommend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to people who want bangers.
- Fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I feel like that type of music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or that type of media
definitely has a place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> because especially like when
you are in a dark place, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes you're not
looking for happy music </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or things to cheery up
or like listening to, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I guess someone who has been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> in that same emotional state as you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or maybe finding someone who you feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is in that same emotional stage as you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's like a comfort knowing that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> at least you're not the only one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> who's feeling like this now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And when I was in that
moment in my life as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and listening to Nick Drake, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think this album cheered me up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> more than any fucking album. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause when I'm really
depressed and really sad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> listening to depressing
music cheers me up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like listening to happy music </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just makes me more depressed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "How does, how dare."
- Why are they happy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm not?
- You're probably depressed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - How dare this beat, be
like upbeat and like happy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How dare these people be happy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you listen to depressing songs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like, fuck man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not, I'm not alone.
- I'm not the only one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not the only one.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the thing, is like I feel listening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> to happy music while depressed
just does the opposite effect </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it makes you go, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how come they're happy, but I'm not. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You know, I can't relate
to this happy mood right now </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> because that's not where I am. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Right now I'm in this dark
depressing like somber moment. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And I need something that can like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, compliment that feeling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - So that's why I love Nick Drake. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then yeah, I talked about MF Doom. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> American football? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> So they're pretty much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think there are a recent like addition </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to my favorite bands. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But they made me fall in love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with this genre of music
called Midwest emo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor, Garnt] What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What the? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There is a genre of
music called Midwest emo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know what people
say, genres out loud. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just think, "You're just lying." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I just like.
- Like you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like at this point, I feel
like music, most of all, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like people just make up genres. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Of course they do.
- It it's music most of all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, of course, ff course they do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're just like, "It's not punk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "It's just some derivative of punk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "We don't wanna be the
same as those punk bands." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So what's so good about 'em man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why do like, is emo country? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- Emo Midwest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Midwest emo.
- Midwest emo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - How'd you define Midwest emo? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's Midwest? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is emo made by bands </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who have lived in the Midwest America. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So what is the difference
between Midwest emo and emo? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so emo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - In terms of sound? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay.
- Is there a Southern emo? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Blabbers)
- I'm sure there is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I wouldn't be aware of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So Midwest emo is like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So basically these guys founded the genre </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like the Indie scene
for the past 20 years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> has been just filled
with Midwest emo bands. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It has?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, they're like,
- I have no idea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a lot of bands
who have gotten big off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Band Camp and like SoundCloud </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and like Spotify and stuff,
- Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just that are in this genre. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (burps) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> How do I explain Midwest emo? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like Indie rock and
Math rock with folk music. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is Math rock? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God.
- This's why, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't understand.
- How do you explain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> math rock now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - This is the problem cause every time, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> I speak to people who really know music, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they start saying things to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "You're just
lying, you just lying." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like why isn't that on iTunes, that thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Am I stupid, like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is on iTunes, probably. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It probably is now, but to me it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "Are we categorizing
music too much, like?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But that's because I feel music
just in general has expanded </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to so far that it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's kind of a shame to
just throw it all away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just rock or pop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's true, I guess. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe this is just my own
inability to understand it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I'm just like, "why?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the same thing with
like electronic music, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Like we have electronica, you
have house, you have trance, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you have techno.
- Yeah, I guess. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Whereas someone who doesn't
like music will be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> "It's just all electronic." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just the beeps and the boobs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just the beeps
and the boobs, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So same thing with Mid.
- That's trash. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So Midwest emo is like,
as the name suggests, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of the lyrical
themes are very depressing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> But it's not like folk music, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like strictly.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's not like a Nick Drake. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like, there's a band behind it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Usually a lot of the songs can be upbeat, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> but usually the lyrical
contents are very depressing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Hence the emo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So that makes the emo
when it's depressing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's kinda like, it's kinda like emo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> This is gonna sound really bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Midwest emo is like Nick
Drake, if you were privileged. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like if you were like, if you were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno if that's a hard tackle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - If you like, if you like,
- I don't understand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot about music.
- If you were like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know,
- We're getting into </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> so many layers right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Midwest emo is like
it's coming from bands </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> who're like have lived in the Midwest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in small towns where it's not like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're born into poverty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's kinda shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's just like they
kinda just lived in a town </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's in the middle of
nowhere in the Midwest, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- not a whole lot to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay.
- Except get sad about shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because they don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because they have like,
- Because you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from Minnesota,
- Suburban Emo? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is like Suburban Emo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> That's the only way.
- I just made that up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is, it is literal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is a.
- I just made a new genre </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> of music right now.
- It is emo rock. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - With mixes of folk music for people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who live in suburbs in Midwest areas. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Cameraman] Paramore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Paramore?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So Paramore
- Paramore, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Paramore kind of took Midwest emo sound </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and put a little bit more
of like a punk twist on it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- You're right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - So they're a little more like a upbeat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But there's still like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the lyrical context of like Paramore songs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are still very much like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm feeling depressed because
this girl doesn't like me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she left me and you know,
- Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like my town has nothing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my friends have all moved
away, that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So American Football is that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And through American football,
I found I've like, so, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you know how Spotify has that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like Spotify wrapped.
- Yeah, yap. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Midwest emo was number
two for me last year. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - And American Football
was a big reason for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow.
- Because I just listened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to a lot of American Football,
- Used to that much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And not just American football, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Got that outta influence?
- There's a lot of other, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Midwest emo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I basically just found this large pool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> of Midwest emo bands and
they're all fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What appeals to you about Midwest emo? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah (chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's such a random like.
- It is right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's such a random genre of music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> For one, the music is just good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, it sounds good,
it's like performed well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's got blends of math rock, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is very technical
rock and technical guitar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just love that sound in general. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan does a lot of really good math rock. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan has it's own branch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of math rock, called Japanese Math Rock. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And Japan is like really
fucking good at just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (blabbering) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Like Ling Tosite Sigure,
for instance, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the opening psychopath
their first song? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, that's math rock. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Where it's like very technical guitar. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Didn't know that.
- And it's just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> very Whaley.
- Fair enough. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But Midwest emo kind of
takes a lot of that style </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> of just like technical guitar,
which just as a guitarist, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can appreciate for once. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That makes sense.
- Like one thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I always want to know is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> how much do you appreciate
music in a technical sense? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Or like a theory sense, where obviously, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you're way more musical trained, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> musically trained than say I am. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So how much does that play
into your taste in music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or your appreciation of music in general? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I Mean if I hear
something I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh that's cool." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> What did you just do there? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Then obviously I'm gonna
like perk my ears up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I'm not gonna fall in love with a band </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just because they're technical. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- That makes sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because again, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> at the end of the day,
- It's feeling, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- If your music isn't good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> then it's not good, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- You know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've listened to a lot of Midwest emo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and even like metal, like
technical metal bands </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or stuff like that where I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> "Yeah, your technical, you are skilled." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But, the music isn't really
for me, kind of thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And then I guess finally, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> is the only Japanese guy, is Maeda Jun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He basically, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That name sound familiar.
- Yeah, he wrote music </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like Kanade.
- He also wrote Kanade. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He also wrote </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Kanade, Aaron Cannon.
- What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and Angel B, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> so basically every key.
- So basically, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> what makes Maeda Jun,
- Is this cause </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you got into The Gacha recently? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> But what makes Maeda Jun my fucking idol, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just, again, the fact that
this man can single handedly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> write a story, write characters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just write all the music for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just single handedly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It must be an advantage then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You can like, you know the characters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> in the story better than anyone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can craft the whole music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I don't know like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Of course I like, I look up to this guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just for his ability to tell a story </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because like Kanade and Aaron and Cannon </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and angel beats are like,
you know, great stories. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But like, I think the one
thing that makes Maeda </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like I appreciate Maeda Jun </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is just how fucking
musically talented he is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because not only can he
write like somba piano tracks </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that have no lyrics at all, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the entirety of the Kanade a soundtrack, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and make me cry like a fucking baby. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I cried, I cried. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - But he can write
fucking bangers as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like you know, any of
the Angel Beats songs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yep, yep. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are absolute fucking
like Girl's Dead Monster </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that fictional band he
created in Angel Beats, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> every song is a banger. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like you can write bangers
and you can make me cry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's pretty impressive,
I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like how do you do that?
- I didn't know that really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And so you were talking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> about The Gacha Game I got into. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So Key recently released a Gacha Game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> called Heaven Burns Red, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is the first fully Maeda Jun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> produced game in 15 years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Huh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And so he wrote the story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it a visual novel? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's yeah, it's kind of
it's very dialogue intensive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause it's a fucking Maeda Jun game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (sniffing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's also like a turn
base RPG kind of thing as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay.
- Of course it does Gacha. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course.
- You know I've I love it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kinda he's got his music? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He wrote the story, he
wrote the character designs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> He came up with the character designs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Huh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He came up with a scenario </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he wrote all the music for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's why he hasn't
been doing anime recently. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Hasn't he? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - All this time in a Gacha Game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, it's also because
he's been extremely sick. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, true.
- As well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like the whole, you know
the whole theme in Angel Beats </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the heart thing, that's
just based off his own life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because he has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck hell.
- A chronic heart disease </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or something.
- This is a beast or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's done so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Jesus! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean he wrote, I'm pretty sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I dunno if this is true, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I think he wrote Angel
Beats in the hospital bed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Seriously. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, while he was admitted to hospital, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> he wrote Angel Beats.
- What the, what a bam </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something.
- And it's just, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's just like, he's a bam. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the fact that like,
again, this man, doesn't miss. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not just like he hate it.
- He don't miss. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He don't miss, like every, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> even in the new game, the story is great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The characters are great
and the music fucking slaps. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I guess, I guess everything else </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just lifts your enjoyment
of the music more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- And it's like okay, but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I feel like, you
know we were saying earlier </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that like Fooly Cooly as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Like pillows, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I was very close to putting
Pillows because that's just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Pitches it out for you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think Maeda Jun just
pitches it out for me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> because as much as I love
the Fooly Cool soundtrack, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the first soundtrack
that made me fall in love </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with soundtracks was Kanade. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because like, again, as a pianist myself, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> listening to like piano music </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that makes me fucking break
down crying like bitch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can perform it.
(sobbing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's like I can't even, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I can't even learn to play
these songs without crying. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's like that's,
- That's wholesome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - And that's like really
hard to do as someone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who like you know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause as someone who writes music, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I strive to do that to people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And the fact that this guy can do it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> over and over, and over again, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> with everything also writes is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "How do you do that?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can murmur at all that talent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not fair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just saying, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Key would not be where
they are without this guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey, sometimes you see someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, "You're
a bit too talented. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is unfair.
- You're, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - And he's good looking like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah.
- As if I couldn't like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> give me something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> to hate about you.
- God, obviously didn't love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> all humans equally.
- No, true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing)
- He made you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hate Maeda Jun.
- He made on Maeda Jun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's not fair, it's not fair. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's not fair. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wish I had a sliver of
the talent this guy has. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But I guess,
- That guy's so talented. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's my three by my three. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was very, I feel like I learned a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't even know anything.
- I learned way more than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> me talking myself or listening to Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, no, no, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel a little bit
pushback because I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I need to somehow top Garnt
living in anime, Beck story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't top that.
- I couldn't top it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was like.
- We call that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the Slumdog Millionaire. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Boy, we're just living in Garnt's life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> We're not, we're not in this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Garnt's story is his own.
- I swear. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I will forever live in that shadow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I swear, I have mentioned before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I've been in the band, just.
- You've not, you've not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, same way everyone's
been in the band. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, no, you don't know.
- Why does that mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've been, I've been in like six bands, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but I never had a cool story like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought when I said I was in a band, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone had similarly experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no.
- It's not at all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - You're wrong. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - For example, what normally happens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're in the band then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're just kinda like.
- You're not playing gigs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pretend to
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You go to the drummer's house, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you play a couple of cover songs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's it.
- And then you're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "All right, cool, see you never again." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that happens all the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You sing Smash Mouth once.
- What's the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's the point of forming a band, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're not gonna play gigs? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean.
- How you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how you gonna play gig? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How you gonna arrange that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How you gonna play gigs?
- You're like Trump </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> who's fucking dumb as fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How did you get, how did you get a gig? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's so fucking easy in Brighton, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> there's so many.
- Or girl? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, in Brighton. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In Sydney, it's pretty fucking difficult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cause there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> no music stage.
- Where's like fields, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where am I gonna perform, Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where am I gonna sing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Smashed Mouth too?
- To the sheep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where am I gonna sing, All star, Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Think about this.
- Look like five gigs </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> going on every weekend in Brighton. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess I did take that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't even top you when it comes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to like band names either, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> because that band name is just like fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The best band name I was
in, was Resting Bitch Face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing)
But that's just because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the lead singer had a resting bitch face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's always like that,
it's like Chido Puffs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, it's Chido, I always like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's got battle in the ass in 10 years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and we have copyright fringe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly.
- I'll just deal with it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> But damn, I guess that was
our Trash Taste in music. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let us know down below whats
your thoughts about it, and. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Who has the trashiest taste in music? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Always that's me, thank you very much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I appreciate that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probably like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I had a hard time explaining
why I liked my music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, you did not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, boy, you fucking hard about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You did it perfectly.
- You had the longest segment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - You literally had amazing stories </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> for every single reason.
- I literally just did like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The thing is I didn't
even talk about the music. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but you had like
a kishimoto filler awkward </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of stories for every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> single band you about.
- Joey, fuck off, man. </SPEAKER_06>
