<SPEAKER_01> you're </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_08> conor black is darker </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> than brown yes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> okay thank you what a hot song thank you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> okay can we can we check that can </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> someone factor that stuff </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> out more it stands out more yeah well </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> let's get the ruler out let's uh let's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> let's get the ruler if you want to if </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you if we want to go we're going down to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> the middle </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> does your face feel heavier with </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> blackheads </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> i know black paint is heavier than white </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> paint is that true yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> is it actually yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> that sounds like it could be true but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> that also sounds like it could be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> complicated so are you saying so are you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> saying that a head of black hair is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> heavy i don't believe any other color of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> hair </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> well on that scale where your hair is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> not of a significant like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> weight in general right i think it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> very minimal but like let's say i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> learned this because i was like i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looking at like weird uh ways that uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> planes save costs yeah which actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> ties in nicely to auto layer travel yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> travel so if you're traveling yes the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> reason why you don't see black planes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh because they're heavier it's heavier </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i thought it would just would have cost </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot to paint the damn thing well no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> they paint it white </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh i i would have thought they painted a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> wire because of reflection yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> or maybe the heat that is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> twice as heavy i believe black paint is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> twice as heavy as white paint damn okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i didn't know that well uh white hair is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> thicker than black hair so i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's just enough paint that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just like black hair nerfing yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because obviously because like that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that's that's like nature doing a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> balance patch right it's something to do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with the pigments </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's the weirdest balance patch i've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> ever heard white hair is thicker than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> black hair because black hair is heavier </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> than white god's like shave off a few </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pounds yeah we got a little level of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> playing field right now i got it wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> white paint contains higher solid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> content than black paint so white paints </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> actually solid content no no no no no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> referring to athletes referring to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> airplanes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah no that's what's there so wait so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> white paint is heavier than black paint </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because they require more pigment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> to achieve the same level of saturation </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so then i'm sure i'm pretty sure that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> wrong so then why do we not have black </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> planes yeah this is considered this is i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think i think the i think it's not that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> deep i think it's purely just because it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reflects more of the sun and it doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> turn the plane into a you know [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> oven we're sounding like [ __ ] flat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> earthers right now yeah yeah yeah why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why play white paint's clearly heavier </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> okay yeah this this is this is the this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is the reasoning behind it i have is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that what a flat earth </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but have you seen a black plane before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> how do you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we've clearly never been around the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> world the same amount of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pseudoscience we're saying right now i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like no none of us are even close </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to scientists and uh we can like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could logically make uh an argument for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> both i feel yeah and uh come out on top </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but uh i don't we don't uh even if the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if even the fact checkers i mean to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fair oh yeah it would make sense if the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> planes were black because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like then it'd be easier to spot in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sky right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no it would be harder to spot in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> night time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right because it would be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> completely invisible then but it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> completely invisible anyway </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is so confusing you can't see a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> bright white plane in the night </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when i googled uh does black paint way </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> more than white paint google said white </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> paint weighs more but then i got another </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> article that says </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh black paint weighs more so bottom </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> line we don't [ __ ] say bottom line </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> nobody knows no one knows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we we cannot even scientists can't even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> agree with each other if black or white </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is heavier than each other have you ever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been in a plane that wasn't painted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> white </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh i've been believe i have the ugliest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> plane i've ever been on it was like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> shade of like you you i was with you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> easyjet isn't that it was like it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> like a shade of like highlighter oranges </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> oh that is that is [ __ ] disgusting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's a gross color i know they paint it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so that they don't have to like keep </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> like fixing the impurities on the chrome </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or whatever oh is that what it is yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because it's it's cheaper to just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> paint it again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i thought it was like a branding thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh well i mean obviously it's like well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> we have to paint it to save costs yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> as well brand it a little bit yeah but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is it heavier than white or black paint </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> probably it's probably heavier but maybe </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the branding is like worth it it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> probably lighter right because it's easy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> jet so it's got to be cheaper </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> surely surely yeah i don't know that is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i guess now that i think about it i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think that's the only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hey like only plane i've been on that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like completely different color from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> white i've never eaten </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i've been on the pikachu plane i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna say that apa aside from the pizza </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i thought i was going to be more excited </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> getting on that plane but then i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> realized i can't see you can't see it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> just looks like a plane this is what it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> feels like to get a sick skin in a first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> person game it's like it's like do you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> want a badass skin then i can't yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> that actually is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> amazing what's the point what's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> point i never got that why do people </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> care about skins in first person games </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so you can flex it on other people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because you see some other people you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> see your arms and that's pretty much it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> it's to show dominance amongst your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> fellow players yeah to make them know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> you have the samurai armor and halo you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> have an absolute massive [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i obviously have not played enough first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> person games but we're not talking about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> games today what are we talking about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> because i thought it'd be fun to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> actually do a themed episode it's been a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> while since we've done a themed episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right the music episode was the last </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> this is the most scuffed themed episode </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> by the way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we haven't written anything down we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just like winging it yeah i mean i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> i mean okay by themed episode we have a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> topic that i hope we're gonna stick to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i'm not okay i'm not gonna get it i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> not gonna guarantee that we're gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> stick together i guarantee we'll talk </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> about among us in 20 minutes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> but uh i i feel like now that we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting ready to travel and now that it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> seems like the country is slowly opening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back up i mean at the time of recording </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh japan have finally let in you know uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> work visas and student visas after like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what two years is it like two and a half </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> two years and who knows what the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> situation is going to be like now when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> this episode actually is released maybe </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the country will be open and maybe a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> bunch of you are going to be traveling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> to japan for tourism and stuff like that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> you know best case scenario is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> before the year ends people start coming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> so hopefully this episode will come in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> handy when you do eventually come to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> japan yeah but uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean so like probably gonna be a while </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> though yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lots of lots of time to plan out well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah you know like many people pointed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out japan unfortunately uh has an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> extremely older population </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and older people don't really leave </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> japan and a lot of them have never left </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> japan never even gone out of the country </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah so a lot of the people i think it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> like 80 or 70 90 percent of people agree </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the travel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ban right yeah whereas other countries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know like europe uk it's like well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> i've got to have a holiday in benidorm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> oh my cousin's from who lives in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> portland because people in the uk want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the country to be open because otherwise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they'd be stuck in the uk and where the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] is there to go on a holiday in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> uk butlins </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah which is why it sucks because like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> obviously a lot of people from america </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> europe don't really understand why japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> isn't opening up and it's like well you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> need to kind of understand the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japan puts like probably the most amount </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of effort into their domestic tourism </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah i mean that ties into the whole </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> elderly population yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> people like i want to travel but i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> want to get on a plane yeah i know i'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get on a bullet train and go somewhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> completely different yeah it's you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but let's just be optimistic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'll be i'll stop being one customer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> let's just be optimistic and let's be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you know what maybe maybe the old </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> people will uh change their minds and be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know what you know what tourism </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> tourism good right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> single wars started because the old ones </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so so yeah so let's say japan is open </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you are planning a trip to japan and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've heard us talk about a [ __ ] ton of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things um in like about close to like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hundred episodes now so you don't you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know where to look because we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we've been talking about japan for what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about about japan for 100 episodes so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't really know even where to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> start or maybe we've set a location </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> place and you're like what or who is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that yeah so we thought it'd be fun to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just have an episode where it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cl like collectively what we actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recommend or don't recommend about japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're gonna plan our trip use this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> episode as like a placeholder just to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> listen to it and be like oh that sounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting and if the place sucks you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> can blame us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously it depends on how long you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> going for that's the best yeah yes we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> talking about five days </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe you can still go out of tokyo yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but five days you can very easily just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stay in tokyo and have a great time the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> first two times i came to japan i never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> left </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah exactly mainly because i was scared </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> um and of the old </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people they're going to beat me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean you know using the shinkansens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and stuff is kind of intimidating it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> daunting yeah if no one's ever like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> helped you do it yeah no it's it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> intimidating because obviously in tokyo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a safety net because a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> things in tokyo are built with the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> idea that there's going to be people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from abroad coming to visit right so a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lot of places a lot of places have you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know english menu still you know you uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's way more it's way more friendly and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> open whereas if you go outside of tokyo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you want to go eat and you're just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay this restaurant probably doesn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have english on it dark souls </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this this 70 year old shop owner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has probably never seen a foreigner in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> her life exactly exactly and it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> daunting you know even even nowadays for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh for us even though if even though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're well traveled you know sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i i can do it but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes i have to like psych myself up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm japanese and i get intimidated yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because they look at me and they're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> you're not japanese </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know when it happened i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> stopped giving a [ __ ] about being awful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> at japanese like a few months ago yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so now i just talk and then i get over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it yeah i don't i don't know if i do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> good but i always get what i need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah so whether or not i'm doing it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> right or not i get my i get my tonkatsu </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah exactly um but yeah like just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretend okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're you've just landed and you're on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a trip with the boys we're gonna show </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_08> you go on the narrator express which is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like the most famous like bullet train s </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> thing from narita airport it's like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so expensive it's actually like 80 bucks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> but there's a skyline as well which you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> can get yes but like i didn't know about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that the first time i came to narita </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they don't advertise they don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> totally advertise their narrator express </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's convenient yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> because like the narita express um is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the big kind of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> shinjuku right yeah it goes to shinjuku </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right but uh yeah it's the it's the big </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> one that's advertised about how to get </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> into tokyo and like a one-way ticket </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there uh using the narita express costs </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> about i think 80 to 100 bucks yeah [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like 200 bucks yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the first few times i went to japan i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> didn't i did not know that there were </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> other choices that you could make uh so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if if you have to fly to narita we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> highly recommend the skyline yes which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is cheaper than the norwegian it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cheaper and it stops it basically when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> you get off your plane at narita are you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> done go to the trains and they'll be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like a bunch of ticket things but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there'll be one specific office that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> says skyliner yeah you can't miss it uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they speak english as well so go there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and ask them like 40 bucks yeah you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> pay like half the price yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> it's it's great and it's just as fast </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it's actually just as fast which is why </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm just like why is the narita express </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> twice as expensive because they can get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> their money though yeah yeah but yeah go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> to hannah hannah's super easy you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> basically in uh where are you near in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> canada uh nearly odaiba yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah tokyo so you're actually one you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in tokyo two you can you know take the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> subway dude the [ __ ] uh you can take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the monorail dude the monorail is has a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> sick view dude yeah the monorail awesome </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or you can just get a cab if you're lazy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can get a cab train or monorail but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the most aesthetic one is definitely a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> lot of the caps have the uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> english-speaking uh computer thing in it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> oh really yeah i've never used it i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i just shouted them like go here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but um yeah this uh i've never seen them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe i should test it just see how it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> goes yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so like we said you know first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first step if you can fly to canada we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> highly recommend you fly to hanada </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because you're gonna have such </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's gonna you're gonna have like a way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> better experience it's gonna be less </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stressful getting just genuinely as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's a really nice airport yeah it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really nice airport you get better views </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's also cheaper so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's basically every reason you could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> possibly think of to fly to a certain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> airport over another if you have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> choice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's normally more expensive to go there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but the cost of like the train tickets </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and transitions yeah yeah it might make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up for my money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah exactly so it offsets the cost it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's like gatwick in heathrow yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in london gatwick's a joke gatwick is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> basically in brighton what's the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> point of the airport it's great for me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's it's annoying as [ __ ] it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> literally not in like in london what's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the other airport that you guys are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> heathrow no there's one more right oh no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> luton now no no no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> then we go to like then we've got like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> stansted </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] like i don't even count those as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> like [ __ ] airports okay those getting </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to stansted and stuff like that is more </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> difficult than get it like the journey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like to france yeah right right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's it's ridiculous about japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're talking about japan yeah pov </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've just landed in your airport where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where are you going to stay where would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you recommend staying what's it what's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the best player </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> you've got a lot of options right like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> hotel is literally the same stories </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't do up okay but okay all right yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> you might have to deal with racist books </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> in your hotel room which sucks but it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this it's like the same price as like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> capsule hotel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a closet because it is a capsule </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> hotel yeah i mean you get a bed though i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> would highly recommend i would highly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> recommend airbnbs airbnbs </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is my is my best experience in terms of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> accommodation staying in tokyo which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> might be which might be difficult though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because of the recent like airbnb </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> even off because i have stayed in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> airbnbs since they've got ridden got rid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of a lot of airbnbs and they are still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 10 times better than most hotels in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tokyo and the reason is because most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hotels in tokyo are they are just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> business hotels right they're they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they come with the assumption that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just going to stay like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the guys staying there aren't even going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be going to be in the hotel at all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> unless you're staying at like a hilton </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like everything else is just like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything else is just everything else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> is just a closet or a shoebox i think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's some decent ones i think i've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> stayed in i don't know where they are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah priced i'm sure there is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> i think you have to look you do yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you do have to look but i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with airbnbs there's just you tokyo is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> absolutely saturated with hotels there's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of hotels yeah like because they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know if all the airbnb yeah yeah you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can definitely find a good hotel if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what you want because i get it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes you don't deal with an airbnb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because sometimes you know it's kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a weird experience you have to sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really sometimes sometimes you get the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> key in a really weird way and sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're in an apartment building and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> get stared at and stuff and then also </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like the neighbor's house three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't really understand how the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> locks work and stuff you're like i get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it a hotel is just like boom card in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's there's services they can do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your laundry and stuff i get it i just i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just feel like you it's yeah it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> it's not this it's up to you but like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i want to worry less about things i want </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> to safe in my room yeah but you're also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably staying at a hilton </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that's like that's like a one night </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> thing if i'm lucky </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [Music] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i i feel like it's a waste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> staying in a luxury hotel for like more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than one just like more than one day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like you want to do [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> you know what i mean like you want to go </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> outside like just get a hotel with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> enough room where you can be comfortable </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> eating a cup noodle in it if you want </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> let let me try let me sell you on the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> airbnb all right guys </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> okay because with airbnb you have more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anemies you have like you have a working </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] microwave or like one of those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a lot of airbnbs have one of those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mini grills so if you want to like go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> family mart or 7-eleven or lawsons and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> buy your buy the famous fried chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's uh that connor and chris have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eaten a lot but you don't want it cold </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you can perfectly just grill it in your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> airbnb warm it's home when you buy it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> what do you mean it's warm when you buy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how how long are you carrying around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this family i don't know i don't i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> okay so like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i i will say that probably the one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> country on earth you don't need a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> microwave is japan yeah there's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> literally one on every corner that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> you're allowed to use freely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> that is true absolutely that is true </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> i love this one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know how that was your first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> lives </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like guys they have a microwave </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> they have a microphone don't worry okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> okay but no like normally like i found </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like you get more room in your airbnb as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> well you like yeah like a lot of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> times the hotel rooms it's just a shoe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> box where you don't have room to walk at </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> all </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah with airbnbs you actually have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> walking space sometimes you you have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like a living space and like a bedroom </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> space which is like which is good uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> another thing is that a lot of airbnbs i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> found in japan especially they come with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> portable wi-fi right so a lot of times </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you don't want to faff around with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> getting data in japan because it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's such it's such a hassle but with so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> many airbnbs basically about 90 of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> airbnbs i've stayed at the owners are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind enough to provide you with a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> portable wi-fi which not only works as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the wi-fi in the airbnb but works as a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> portable wi-fi which you can take with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you as you're traveling around japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> although i will say that i think most if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not all train stations in the tokyo area </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> have free wi-fi </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] annoying to connect to it though </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also also every mcdonald's has a free </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> wi-fi yeah i mean just honestly you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it from the airport there's like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bazillion of these it is expensive as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] though data is expensive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> google maps is literally your best </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> friend yeah i still use it with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> amount of walking you're going to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> with me yeah everyone's like if you have </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like an international plan for data or </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> something i i highly recommend that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> buying data here which is why i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> recommend airbnbs if they give you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> portable wi-fi buying data here as a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tourist is really really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> expensive it's like seventy dollars for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like there's two weeks ago there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> vending machines </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> vending machines at the airport that do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sim cards </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> data only sim cards yeah they are quite </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> pricey but you know it will do what you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> need to do because i mean google chrome </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> you can get a vending machine experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> right off the bat right yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my god i've never bought a similar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> vending machine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> there's also you can </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just like type in portable wi-fi </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> whatever airport you're going to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there'll be ones you can get as well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah well one piece of advice for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that i want to tell people is get a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seeker </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah oh yeah because that's going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be your best friend as well this is this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is a suica card okay this is the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> equivalent to an oyster card although i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't believe we use it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> like metro cards um it's really easy uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> you can get one at basically any machine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the metro or anything like that here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 500 yen yeah it's like it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 500 yen and you can load it up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> immediately um every machine has an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> english option and multiple other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> languages as well so you don't need to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worry about learning japanese to buy a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> suiker car it's super easy and yeah same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> bullet trains yeah and also you can pay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with it if you don't want to deal with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cash load up load up a [ __ ] ton of money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every single fast food chain and every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> single conbini will accept it everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> mostly vending machines as well yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> except machines trains yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything which is which is very very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> useful because if you don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you don't remember this then you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna meet needing to bring cash do not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> expect to be able to pay by card </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anywhere just just some places do accept </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it but don't expect to come into a place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if it looks like a you know a big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> establishment that should have a card </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> machine a lot of places don't accept </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cards or even credit cards to be fair it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is getting better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a lot more places now especially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like since when i first moved i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remembered like half the places i went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to didn't accept card at all but like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel nowadays like most places in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> central tokyo except card but yeah also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know it's the suka is good because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> again you can use it not just at a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> restaurant but literally anywhere yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> um so super handy yeah but also just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> carry cash with you always yeah because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're going to need it for something in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan um even if you don't know what it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is immediately there's always going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be one little thing where this place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't accept anything but cash or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> machine doesn't accept anything but cash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're you're going to need it so don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't assume that we're like in japan's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like every other you know first world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> country where uh we have a character </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a mom mom-and-pop like shop right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the old like restaurants and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like that they'll usually just be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> nope cash only yeah yeah and uh i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> since you're watching trash taste you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm i'm guessing a lot of you are weebs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right i'm guessing i'm guessing maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> maybe i don't know this i don't know huh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> where you going with this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you would you could you talk about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> archaeology we've told we've talked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about how akihabara is overrated right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah or how we think it is but i feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it still is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the best places to go if you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> have like a day or two in tokyo and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> you've never been to japan before right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> because i feel like there's nothing that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> really beats that first day akihabara </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> experience because yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yes you can get figures for a better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> price online or other places what's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> magic it's the magic yeah it's the magic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right it's like it's like disneyland but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for weebs yeah it's the fact that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> literally every billboard and building </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you see around you is covered in anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah which is like not really a place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can experience anywhere else in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> world or rather anywhere else in japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah exactly it's kind of out of the way </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's a little annoying to get there i'd </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> say i mean it's like what like 15 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minutes from tokyo station </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah i'd say if you're going to stay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> anywhere stay around shinjuku shibuya </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you want a fun time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah yeah yeah i'd say shinjuku probably </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_01> maid cafes are kind of just becoming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like old at this point yeah because like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> up and you eat inside of a cage that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> what they scream half the time yeah they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> think i went through the show i think i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> went there and i thought the food was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> like the worst food i've ever had in my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> life no the main cafe if it was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> million times no like i i i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the maid cafe food i don't know why it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a 100 of the time it's horrible food i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> mean it's on par with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you know rice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> we only think it's good food because a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> cute girl made it no no i don't know i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think it's okay no but most people feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that way so well the cute girl made us a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> must be good see and everything's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> overpriced as well yeah you know it's </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_07> the denny's like deluxe yeah it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> so fancy and the prices are like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ridiculous this is this is what i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> denny's wished it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like like going to japan and just going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to a maid cafe with all the themed bars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> that all cafes are available it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> going to america to for a burger joint </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and going to mcdonald's or some [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like that you know that's right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> that's that's like you like you can you </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_08> you have i'm there you have so much </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> choice of so many different themes and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> different unique concepts and then you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go to a maid cafe where they do the momo </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> beam on your food and call it a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> day that's it that's it thank you thank </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] die when i go to a major just go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to me cafe at your local con it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably the same experience it actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is actually honestly the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's honestly the same except the only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> difference is that the one in japan you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably won't understand what they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saying half the time exactly that's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> only difference yeah all right but uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean you'll understand when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're at all majors i don't want to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> hurt i want to go i'm far too british to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'm like i want to see you at a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> main cafe you and you and chris and are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> made careful you and chris and the main </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> cafe would be the best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's too much cringe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i mean i mean like i'm i even i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more attuned to like the anime culture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and stuff and i'm just like i can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> handle no i couldn't handle it it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's uh i i think i'd rather be seen at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a strip club or something like that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would i i would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like that's less normal yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> more normal yeah more normal but yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean like obviously get akihabara out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your system because you've got you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to go you're going to want to go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to akihabara yeah you are going to have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a good time yeah and uh if you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looking for you know places to go then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just look at our figure special you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's we basically curated our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> figure special to the places that we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like to shop in akihabara um are there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> any other shops you would recommend in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> akihabara that they go to oh god this is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> so mean why why me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> super potato is really good that's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> retro game place that's like what's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dojin store oh it's an animal yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah well there's one there's melon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> books which are two different ones uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> both are good yeah that's melon books i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think has like four entire floors of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just doujin stuff so if you like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then go for it but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> has a better selection in my opinion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i think so and that one has like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seven floors or something that is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seven or eight floors </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's two buildings as well yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um yeah because like a lot of akihabara </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is you go into a store and it looks like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a one it looks like it's just a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one-story store because it's like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] tiny right uh it's full of stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you go in and you realize they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have stairs and then you go up the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stairs and you realize there's another </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> set of stairs and you just you realize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it just keeps going up and up and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up and up so a lot of suddenly you're in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> a mob </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> basically and also like the best thing i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think about akihabara especially when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you go into like the really like small </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> building unmarked buildings is that each </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of the floors is usually a different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> store entirely so you could be in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> figure store at one point you go up the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stairs and then suddenly you're in an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> idle shop and next moment you're in a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> retro game shop yeah yeah exact moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're in a tech shop and it's all in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> one building and it's yeah great yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why you can literally spend like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> hours just in one random building that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you stumbled into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and of course like the arcades there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well because if you want to go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan i highly like you have to go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> the arcades there's this oh go to the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> sega ones because they have the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> mech pilot game dude yeah yeah what's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that one called i can't remember but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe don't go to the other ones in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> north carolina though because like most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of them are gone yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> all </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a ton of sega buildings outside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of akihabara oh yeah yeah they have like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good games but the uh but the one in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> zanacki happened have a lot of like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> vintage games yeah they have typing of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> the dead still they still have that yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they have a they have an entire building </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that just has like an entire floor full </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like old school ladies crazy taxi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's got a few other games got time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> crisis two or three which one you play a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> game on the arcades for like 50 yen i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> think yeah yeah it's like really like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> most most arcade games are just a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> hundred yen which is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> uh the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> old uh retro game oh yeah oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah yeah yeah yeah it was dope as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which is also right shinjuku so yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah uh i can't remember what it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> called just type in arcade place takada </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> no baba yeah yeah um and yeah like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still think like my favorite arcade game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is the mecca pilot game so there is have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> we talked about it we've mentioned it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> before but again we don't know the name </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's literally like a hydraulic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mech </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll see it because you literally are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> piloting a mech right you'll see people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like [ __ ] tilting and [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah so you it's kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reminds me of um these old-school like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> rides you see in malls or sometimes or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something where it's like you you're put </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into like a capsule and you're like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a roller coaster and like the uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the capsule like tilts along with like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the roller coasters like 4d yeah like 4d </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you're seeing so imagine that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> except you control the roller coaster </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay so when you when you when you pilot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this mech it'll tilt with you know it'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tilt and curve uh when you accelerate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you feel like the acceleration and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so cool it's if you're a mecca fan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or even if you're not it literally is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the closest you will ever come to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> piloting a giant robot and it's pvp and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's pvp as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> well and it's also like a hundred yen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah it's like it's like five </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> minutes ago yeah yeah it's really good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's battle royale but uh if you are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna go to the arcade you probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> should look at like a tutorial about how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to get like the cards </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because some of the progress some of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> them no like some of the games they will </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not let you go past the tutorial stage </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you don't have a card like basically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you you pay the money every rhythm game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah basically every rhythm game like if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you don't have a card um you're you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> basically just stuck at the tutorial </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> level there should be a card printer in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the building if it's a big arcade </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah most of the bigger ones have it so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you don't have a card just go to a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> big one and there should be a machine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that prints cards and they all have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like three different ones though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> you need to figure out which ones which </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's really confusing i'm sure there's a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> guide online i'm sure yeah also if </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're having trouble what the [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> being said on screen i just hold up </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> google translate to the screen and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> generally it works yeah yeah actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is a good le that is a google </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> translate is it's not perfect but it'll </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> give you the gist of everything yeah it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> will be your best friend but basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you should use it yeah google translate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i didn't know this until i moved to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan where google translates has a uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> camera option where it will live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> translates things that you put through </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the camera of google translate uh it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> been a life saver for me in a lot of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> places here in japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah exactly and uh if you ever in a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> restaurant where it's all in japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then google translate camera will be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> your best friend unless it's handwritten </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> and [ __ ] unless it's handwritten </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh and then you just got it blindly and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> then you just gotta hope that you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with joey and uh he'll translate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> everything for you i just say </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> also sue me i asked for their </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_01> like the big mainstream place i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> personally recommend for weeb stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's not archibra </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> not gonna broadway i was gonna say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i feel like with with akihabara </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you get overwhelmed maybe that's what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you want maybe you want to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> overwhelmed with weeb stuff but the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> problem with the problem with akihabara </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is that it's very very much aligned with </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> let's say let's say weeb culture as </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> opposed to you know more other </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> underground anime culture which you can </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you can find more </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> cool stuff in akihabara i i'd say i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> don't know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> more cool stuff in uh nakano broadway </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because the way i the way i describe </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> akihabara is it's just like imagine if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're on in on the convention floor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right that's that's basically akihabara </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you're on you're you're in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dealers the dealers hall that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> akihabara uh nakano broadway is more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> like the artist alley where you can get </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> more of like the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> more more like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> more stuff that's not my shops around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there like the unconventional stuff the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unconventional stuff right in knocking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on broadway you know there's a store on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the first floor where they just sell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing but old anime cells yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that place is really dope and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> there's other ones that are like from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like 40s and 50s japan styled stuff and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> everything huge store there if you like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> retro games and you want gamecube games </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> or something that's really cheap there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a place called book off oh yeah oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> look off sells a lot of retro enhanced </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff yeah i mean that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so many dude i saw like super mario </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> sunshine in box for like 600 yen yeah so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> like five bucks nice yeah book off is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a uh it's like a big chain here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> isn't it yeah you can you can find book </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> offs </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> most major places there is a book off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somewhere so if you want a good deal for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> second-hand stuff just like a bunch of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> them there's book-off which is mostly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> focused on like books and games and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff like that and then there's another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one called the name's horrible but it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> called hard off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i didn't really think that one through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> uh which is more like kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> second-hand like appliances and like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can get you can games you can get games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at heart off as well yeah um but uh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then book off you can also buy like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> secondhand clothes as well yeah this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty good and then there's another one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's another version of the off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> series </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah right off i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like my big problem with akihabara isn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just the fact that it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all anime which you know that's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> really that's not really an issue it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like you can't really find anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> else so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if you want to go out for a nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meal afterwards there's nothing really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> around akihabara i think the only thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've had in akihabara is the royal host </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and the the uh the ramen the raw ramen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> or if you want a jason ramen to be fair </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah well if you want like sorry guys no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no no i was about to say but what i love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about nakano is that nakano not only has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this like kind of cool underground like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> especially in broadway the whole anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like weeb [ __ ] yeah but once you go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> outside of the broadway section of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nakano which is just one building yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> then it has some of the coolest bars and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> restaurants restaurants and stuff i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the jojo bar is in nagano yeah exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so that's the perfect reason to go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> nakano that's that's a business i do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> want to stay afloat come on outside </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> grinder yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> the jojo bar is [ __ ] amazing yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that that's a place that we want to stay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> in business not the maid cafes bring </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> your business to the jojo bar </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> on twitter though yeah yeah you have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> follow them on twitter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> even though the google hours say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever he tweets out whether he's open </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or not yeah because it's literally just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one person it's one dude yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like like that's another reason to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go to nakano but aside from that there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just so many other cool places and other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cool restaurants and bars that you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go to in nakano and it's one of those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> places where you can just stumble upon a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> place you know you don't need to google </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh you don't need to do a mailing and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like google which one's like five star </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something it's one of those places </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can just get lost in you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh that place that place looks cool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything's so tight knit yeah and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so many tiny restaurants and uh and bars </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff like that yeah cause like i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like when i go on holiday right i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> the kind of person who is just like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> planning out everything i don't have an </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> itinerary what i prefer is just going </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> into a cool area and just discovering </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> stuff for myself you know that's that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the kind of traveler that i am and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of course of course and uh nakano is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like one of the best areas for that i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> agree i agree yeah yeah i wonder so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we've gone to akihabara what else is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something that like you might consider </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> you know i i think even though </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know we don't really go there that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> often anymore because i feel like it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> very much uh you've got to do it while </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're here </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> do a table normally hold on just go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> crazy for it to go to like a cheap </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> izakaya oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> everything it's like it's like x amount </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember how many times we went to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> kinokura </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah yeah if you've got to go to a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> kinokura if you like to drink i mean a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> lot yeah yeah on a monday it's 100 yen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> beers yeah yeah if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> if there's two words you need to learn </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> in japan it's not none of this like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] konichiwa </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> arigato [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> discussion yeah no no you don't need to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> know that [ __ ] that [ __ ] or susame as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> connor just said and nomihoudai which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all you can drink which is which is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> only the the only two words you really </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> need right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> or tabitha </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is food yeah or you can or you can eat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or you can drink i feel like you'll know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's nomihoudai because it'll be very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bright and it'll have a number yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it'll be like 2 000 and you'll see a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> picture of a lot of drinks yeah it'll be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 2 000 something or two if you see a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> timer like 2 000 plus 60 something yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> you're either about to hire a person for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh illegal activities or you're going to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> be having an all you can drink so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> fun for all the family really yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah basically yeah just go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> just go to an izakaya do you recommend </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> going to a chain one or yeah [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> do you go to a kinokura did you yeah no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not english on the table yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's true </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a torii or like any of those like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> chains like although it's not like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the highest of quality in terms of food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but like i think if you're one like 20 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah what's it called again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> we're saying the food isn't that good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but i remember coming here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's [ __ ] amazing compared to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably where you're from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> japan we we have been spoiled our food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tastes uh we've become food snobs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because i remember i remember the first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> day that connor came to japan and i took </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> him to kinokura the moment he got off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the plane yeah and he was like it's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hundred yen for a beer and i'm like yep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he was like oh but it's like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably like a cup right out comes a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] like pint yeah this is the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> greatest country in the world exactly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> exactly yeah literally yeah no the food </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the food the food is good i i forget i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> forget because i've been living for so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> long uh if you're traveling out of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> england the food is like [ __ ] 10 out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of 10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> compare compared to anything you can get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> in england this is just like a basic </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> guide obviously we've been in japan a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> bunch you [ __ ] know this [ __ ] you do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever you want but this is for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> the boys and and girls out there who are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> coming to japan first yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> everywhere you go to have the most 10 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out of 10 food because you will have the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most 10 out of 10 food and uh learn like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> go go do karaoke just just go speaking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of nomi horde yeah speaking of nami hoda </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you will definitely need to know that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> word for karaoke because basically every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> karaoke has nami hoda and i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why you'd want to do karaoke so but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> maybe you do maybe you have a great </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> singing voice i don't i need to be drunk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> to sing okay it will probably be a bit </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> awkward because they don't have like any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> english help yeah you're getting it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i mean you'll be fine i'm sure they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> used to follow just yeah just say the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hold up the number of hours you want in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your hands yeah and then say nomihoudai </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and they'll tell you a price and then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> you just say yes and i feel there's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a weird i guess like stereotype of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this karaoke culture outside of japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> because i think when most people think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of karaoke they think of like open mic </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> like on a stage and stuff like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> which is like i'm not for that yeah i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> think that's kind of cringe because i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> love it dude i love it what do you want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to do i don't know i can't i can't do it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i like tequila </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i like singing in front of you know my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> friends and people i know in a room </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because that's fun like we can all hang </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> the reason the reason i'm not really a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> fan of like the open mic karaoke </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is because you only get two types of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> people that do it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> it's either one the [ __ ] amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> singers who are basically auditioning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for x factor the next day or you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get the piss heads who'd like who just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> murder your ears </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> okay i am </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> alive there is no the thing is there is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> no in between yeah you you either come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out getting a free concert or you come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out regretting the fact that you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> ears there is like no between never a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> moment where like someone finishes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> singing and you're like hey that was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> okay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah i think i like gary there's karaoke </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> bars in japan where you can sing with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone else i love them they're so fun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i remember everyone everyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gets involved everyone in the bar like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gets hyped yeah but you can do that with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a small crowd in a karaoke room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> right but what if you just want to like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> meet some random japanese people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> those things oh yeah i mean but i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's better ways to meet japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> people than a [ __ ] open mind karaoke </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> no no it's the best way but like i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> remember because i never really thought </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> about it because in my head karaoke was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always you know the the japanese style </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> character yeah like in a room right so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i remember when uh when felix uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> came to japan and i really wanted to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> take him to a karaoke in his head he was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like no i don't want to go to karaoke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why and he's like because he thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about the open mic [ __ ] yeah and he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like nah i don't want to do that and i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh my poor sweet innocent child you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know what real karaoke is like and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i took him connor was there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i went with uh dave as well from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> boyinaband yeah and he was like that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the most fun that he's ever had in japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and like i [ __ ] told you yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's honestly like one of the funnest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things you can do in japan i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think the thing about japanese karaoke </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that the song selection is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> godly you want to sing anime songs of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> course you want to sing anime songs you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have all the anime songs at your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> disposal but if you can't speak the if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't sing the nihongo then uh you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got basically every major song from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> england and yeah america tablet and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they'll be like foreign songs or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something yeah yeah you can speak like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh korean songs and chinese songs as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> well like like i i think i think the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese karaoke has a better selection </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of english songs than english karaoke in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's insane right yeah um yeah like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's one of the funnest experiences you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> can do with your mates oh you can also </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> get costumes oh yeah oh yeah we did that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> when we first came to japan didn't we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you can go down to the first floor </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you'll know it's karaoke building so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> like something else cyberpunk outside </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they always have the neon signs or the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really bright signs yeah it's massive if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've seen the floors if you see neon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> signs it's going to be pachinko or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> karaoke and uh the inside looks like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> palace i saw this pachinko they all like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> a palace inside yeah go into go into the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> building if your ears are bleeding it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably a pachinko yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> if it's not bleeding it's probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> karaoke yeah because karaoke is actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> soundproofing yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> although all the pachinko buildings have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> tinted windows so you can't see him yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> so they're like frosted but you'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> you'll if you'll know it's a pachinko </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> building because when someone enters it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and the doors open you can hear that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] from a mile away </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and like i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do the karaokes if they want to sing uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime songs or japanese songs do they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have like a function in a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> karaokes now that where you can actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when he actually spells it out not in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like katakana ah there's something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> there's something </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> super rare and the selection is super </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> limited you're better off just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> looking up the english lyrics on your </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> phone that's true that's true that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> true but uh yeah but they have like tv </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> sizes where they actually play like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> visuals and stuff which is pretty dope </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my favorite things is uh seeing what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of music videos they play with your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> songs that you're saying during karaoke </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's like karaoke videos are my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> favorite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> what is who films that who i'd like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> i think it's the same people make the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> bowling animations yeah probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> must be so like if you've never been to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like an asian karaoke a lot of the music </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> videos it's basically like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> equivalent of a stock a stock uh a stock </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> image </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just with music videos right so you'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have like this random i don't know my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> favorite ones is where is the white guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> at the bar it's the one yeah yeah you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know the one i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he's just like a sad dude </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like a sad specific reference </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> that'll be like one person it appears </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like every four songs yeah oh it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> every queen song is just like these five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people just dancing on a dance floor in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> this empty bar and it looks like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the saddest [ __ ] party </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's my favorite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and yeah i don't know what i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> what company </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] film this karaoke music video </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> british i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the thing because it's not asian </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> people it's uh it's all like either </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> british or american yeah i see it's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weird i actually that's a really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> interesting topic i like i i would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> actually want to know who actually who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually filmed these where who made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> these who actually made these ask joy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sound or something yeah maybe where are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> these videos can i get yeah can i can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> you link me to the video they look like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they're filmed in like the 90s yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> they're really old because most of them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> are still on like a four by three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> aspects yeah yeah yeah yeah you best </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah you know you've like picked like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> good song or a popular song they when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they have like the actual music video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like oh we're singing good today </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> boys we're singing the time when you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> selecting the song it says if it comes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with the actual music video yeah and if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it doesn't then you're gonna probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> get a white guy at a bar yeah cause the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saddest thing is when you select like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> banger song or something and you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> i'm ready and then you hear like a midi </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> track and you're like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> oh it's like like it has like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> banger like guitar riff or something and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like it's like the worst </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> immediate sounding guitar ever it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that's fun but no karaoke is great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially especially with your mates </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's a great like it's because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a great way to just open up with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your mates because normally you go to a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> karaoke bar and you don't really want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sing because you don't want to embarrass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yourself in front of strangers but with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese karaoke you can just embarrass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yourself in front of your mates equally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and uh it's a hell of a fun time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but if you want to embarrass yourself in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> front of your mates in another way you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> can also go to an onsen as well a public </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> golf yes which i think is a much taller </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> hurdle for a lot of people i'd recommend </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> just going to uh you know you can book </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> like uh ryokans uh which normally have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> onsens uh you can book them on like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> booking.com yeah and even if you have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tattoos like uh you know you can if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> do yeah if you have the expandable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> income where would you recommend for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that though because before we we had the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> massive onsen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh in tokyo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah yeah onto monogatari unfortunately </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we can't recommend that anymore because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that was because i was so sad i'm so sad </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because that was like the perfect onsen </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to recommend because you go to the onsen </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> solution </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you'd go you'd go to like diver </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> city and just see the massive gundam and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like damn what a perfect day trip </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah that's the perfect day trip </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately that's not available </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anymore i still think some of the well i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> mean it depends how far out of tokyo you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to go into i mean there's a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like small bath houses in and around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tokyo and like the more uh like suburban </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> areas uh but that's not really an onsen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if you want like the onsen experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without going too far out of tokyo i'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say hakone is probably yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's pretty good um that's in uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> kanagawa which is one prefecture across </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you can you can well not even you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> can get these it's a romance car yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [Music] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> it's like halfway between a bullet train </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> and a regular train it's like more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bougie than a regular train but it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as fast as a bullet train yeah and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can go directly from uh shinjuku to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> hakone in like an hour i think yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's relatively cheap as well yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> um and yeah it's a really really nice </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> little cute smile </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah it's it's really cool it's got </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> there's this really small ava store um </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right on the station yeah yeah which i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> go to every time i don't know and the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reason for that is because hakone is uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what they based tokyo three off of yep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um so if you've seen evangelion and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've seen the movies uh you all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> recognize the trains that like that that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they use there because they look exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like they do an ava um you'll be like oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> so i see shinji right there listening to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> listen to your headphone oh look </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> disgusting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and you walk around you see vending </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> machines and like oscar and mari and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like gingers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you want like a nice kind of maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a two-day trip outside of uh tokyo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because hakuna is not only really good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> especially you know if you love eva of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> course but like also you know there's uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the jio kudani which is like uh like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sulphur plumes of like the mountains of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hakuna is really nice and there's never </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> been there before that's really dope you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go up this like huge uh like i was about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to say monorail it's not a monorail it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like what do they call it like this uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] what are they called it's like not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> a ski lift but what's what </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> gondola yeah gondola that's it yeah you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> got this like gondola from the base uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of this lake uh in in uh in hakone and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you go up into the mountains and you get </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> this really really nice view of the lake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> and on a good day like if the weather's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> really good you can see this like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> perfect view of mount fuji as well so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's really dope and then you go into </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this uh little valley and you go into </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> this place called </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which is called hells valley um japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> has a couple of hells valleys oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> as well um and there's also one around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like gifu as well right but um yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just this like really cool like sulphur </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> plume </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place where you can get really close to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like volcanic sulfur plumes kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> smells like farts uh the entire time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean but it's kind of a really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> cool unique experience um yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> personally recommend it's a good day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trip yeah because i really khaka was the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first hot springs town that i went to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i really enjoyed myself the one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing i will say is if you go to hakone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um it's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really weird because like i went to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hakone and i expected it to be something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not similar to tokyo but like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> expect to go to a hot spring and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you expect to like walk around and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> explore somewhere but like a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> ryokans they expect you to stay at that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one establishment for the entirety of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your trip right a lot of a lot of these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hotels and a lot of these ryokans will </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have all um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> will have all everything you need within </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that facility because they don't really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> expect you to go out and explore because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normally there isn't really much to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> explore in that immediate area unless </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you take a bus or something right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> um at least that was that's my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> experience so yeah there's like don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> expect like you can go explore but if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you want to go explore you probably need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to plan it out a bit more because the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> place you're staying in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is isn't necessarily going to be near </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of tourist attractions yeah um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if you're staying at a ryokan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um having said that if you do stay in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the ryokan uh be prepared to uh get up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and eat [ __ ] breakfast okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's that's that's one thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which uh at an egregiously early time i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm not sure if i am a fan of it but if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you do say ryokan very hands are great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right very kind of great because i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like in terms of hotels they're like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> most aesthetic place you can stay yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you are pampered there it's great it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the most authentic like japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> accommodation experience yeah exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you normally have the nicest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> onsens that you could you could find you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> normally sleep on a on a futon though on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the floor so not a bed so if that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> something you might but if you want that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> authentic japanese experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> [Music] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but like if you if you don't come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> down for breakfast at the agreed time uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they will find your family and they will </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> kill everyone you love or at least </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what i get out of like if if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's included in the cost as well so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's why they're normally quite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> expensive because dinner is normally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> included yeah they don't want you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wasting money yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know these dinners are normally like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really large courses they're like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reason why already okay like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like real cons like normally like what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like three four hundred dollars a night </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minimum </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's because like half of that has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> gone to the food if not food yeah you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> will be eating like a king you will you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> won't eat like so if you see the price </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> of the ryokan um don't get too shocked </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> at the price because you're paying for </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the food as well and it's normally like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> really really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> really good food it's high quality it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> might be even a bit too much sometimes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you'll get a good uh taste of the local </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> dishes though normally yeah these local </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> ingredients yeah and uh yeah a really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> good way to just try japanese food that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you normally wouldn't order like i never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm never gonna order half the [ __ ] they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> give me oh yeah yeah cause half of it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> super slimy yeah uh but i always eat it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i don't wanna you know have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> make eye contact with that small </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> japanese lady who uh asked me why i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't like it which they have done many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> times oh really yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so now i just i just i just eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything i i eat everything but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> originally when i didn't like eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> something they would sometimes just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stare at me and be like why didn't you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eat it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what what's wrong </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what's your dress </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> do you have covered are you dying i will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> find you i will kill you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the thing you feel so intimidated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but no like it's like i i'd even like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> recommend going to ryokan to try the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> traditional japanese food over even </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> going to a restaurant right because with </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the restaurant you don't know what to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> order you know you don't you look at the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> menu and it's like i don't know what i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to like but it's kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ryokan food is kind of like a tasting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> menu you know you kind of get a little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> bit of everything lots of little small </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> chunks of a lot of them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some things you don't like but it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> great way to just easily </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get the traditional japanese experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um just don't miss breakfast because uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did they did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did i hear you say like they came to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your room once and woke you up to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> breakfast oh yeah no yeah a woman </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally i was i was with chris </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i was on a journey across japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> trip and one morning i got oh the night </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> prior i got very drunk uh so as you as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we do as you do and then the morning of </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_08> i have a throbbing headache three how </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> did you get in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what the [ __ ] i've never heard of them </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's an exception though that's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> something else most places they'll just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> like ring you up on the phone to make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like five more minutes mom five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> more minutes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> please don't like modern real cans if </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you will that are more like they're like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they have beds like western yeah and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like way more modernized um in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hokkaido </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well it's it's like it has it's weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause it'll have tatami mats oh but </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> know what yeah yeah those are usually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like more higher up though right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but they're normally it's because i find </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that the prices aren't different like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> really the really traditional ones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes cost more than the more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> modernized ones because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> they're they charge a [ __ ] ton for food </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> or maybe they have uh a lot of workers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> that's one thing they have so many </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> workers every okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> insane they do but also sometimes the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> service is nuts yeah they're like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> moment you turn up there's like four of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> them greeting you they'll like take all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> your bags right away and then oh my god </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's just like so intense i'm like jesus </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> christ what's happening sometimes it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bit too intense right because sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just like okay i i i know you i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know you're wanting to make me feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comfortable but you're making me feel a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> little bit too comfortable now yeah i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> said like three or four recently with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> chris on the video and it was really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i remember i walked up to one and uh </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_07> fucking.com super easily okay uh unless </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it isn't on booking.com which is quite </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> rare actually yeah i've never really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seen anything that's normal it's all on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> booking.com okay it's really weird i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like you'd think like super traditional </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but nah dude you you can book it all on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> booking.com yeah have they modernized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> have they actually miners i've i've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> never seen a real can that i wanted to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go to that wasn't on booking.com right i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know why there is some hotels on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> booking.com yeah yeah which is really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um but yeah i i said at a place one time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> where like they didn't have the onsen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> built in they had a hot tub so they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> would fill the hot tub with onsen water </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> they brought in via truck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's weird so is that really an onsen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> it's an onsen if it has onsen water in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it okay yeah yeah okay which if you fill </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a bathtub with an onsen water that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> technically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> if i bring sea water in my bathtub is it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the sea it's the sea is it the c oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> well there's no like there's no place </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where you can go for the tm onsen you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> know you know the word onsen just means </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> warm springs yeah yeah you can just get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it what makes it onsen is that it has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the [ __ ] minerals yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and every single onsen has like the ph </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> sign and stuff that tells you what's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> outside of it so they're really strict </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> on what can and can't be an onset </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> that's really strange legally speaking </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but uh yeah highly recommend just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> getting over your fear of getting naked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in front of your mouth or whatever and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is that a problem is that a problem i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> think yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah for a lot of people jojo fans uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's don't this does not apply yeah it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't apply to you yeah because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember like there's been a couple of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my friends uh who just like refused to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go to an onsen just because they were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like uncomfortable with getting naked in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> front of me or you know the the mates </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_07> the things that i hate yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> dude </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> the onsen for me is the warm-up for the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the sauna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh really yeah i'm i when it doesn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have a sauna i get so sad but luckily in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> japan now recently sauna's becoming like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> a trend oh yeah for some reason yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> people are obsessed with saunas and the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> health benefits yeah there's a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like dedicated sort of places in japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah i'm and my god do i love sauna </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> i love one dude it's very wide of you i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> think that is very very white but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> um but yeah like i guess going back to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tokyo is there any other places or areas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in tokyo's that you that you like i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like a massive tourist trap but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> just go to golden gate it's fun golem is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> good don't go into any bars where a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> guy's telling you to go into a bar yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> go into bars shinjuku there's a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> really cool places in shinjuku but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> there's also a lot of sketch places in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> shinjuku so yeah you really have to be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> careful again if someone tells you to go </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> into a bar don't go don't go into a bar </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just a rule of thumb uh there's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bunch of really cool bars not in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not so between and sanchome sanchome </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> there's a ton of really cool bars and it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like behind the malls </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah there's a bunch of really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh tightly knit areas that have a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ton of nice bars and nearly all of them </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i've been into are pretty damn good okay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i think it's mostly when we think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> of like sketch places in shinjuku it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> mostly like some parts of golden gai and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> nichol </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which is like the the gay bar district </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> um i've been to a a few gay bars in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> nichole and they're really really fun </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but the problem is a lot of places they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> won't let you in unless you're going in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with someone who they already know yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's true yeah also a lot of them i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> don't think are very foreigner friendly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> i know there's quite a lot actually oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really there's quite a lot okay i've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> seen i've when i went filming there and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> i've been there a few few times there's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of bars that are very very foreign </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so if you want to experience gay bars in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> japan and they are pretty dope at least </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the ones i've been to yeah yeah i got a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> new chairman i mean i think gay bars are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just pretty dope in general check out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> the one that i went to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's an anime any song gay bar and i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> hate some gay bar so you know you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> that sounds fun as [ __ ] yeah oh yeah it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is all the details were just gay bars </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are like some of the funnest bars you </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_01> also they're just a lot of fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just a good vibe it's a really good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bonding experience if you want to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talk to japanese people especially yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah um daikon yama has a great </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> bunch of cool balls like that area </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> does have a bunch of cool bars but they </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_07> expensive but they're super super cool </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like there's like breweries and daikon </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_02> you can walk from here because it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> awesome as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just south of shibuya yeah um it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> one stop away and i'd say that it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i actually prefer episode over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh shibuya even though shibuya is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the more famous place to go to because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to me shibuya is just way too crowded i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know yeah no i get that yeah like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there's also a lot of like really cool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> places in shibuya if you know where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're looking that's true uh you know a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of like shibuya's a lot like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah shibuya's a lot like shinjuku where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like it is like heavily like infested </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with a lot of tourist traps but yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> also shibuya is so massive that yeah if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you go to like you know like uh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> aoyama for example which is like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> area on the way towards harajuku like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> that place has a lot of like really cool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> like hidden stuff around as well which </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's not really that far from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shibuya yeah i think like yeah one thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i would definitely recommend if you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> going to like the big locations is to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like kind of try to venture out of the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> center because there you you do tend to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> find a lot of really cool hidden stuff </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> that isn't overpriced to [ __ ] yeah uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that applies to like most places in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tokyo yeah exactly what you guys think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of ikebukuro i really like ikebukuro </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right well there's two sides two sides </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay there's two sides east side of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ikebukuro okay the west side is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> very very very sketchy yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the east is sunshine city and everything </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> around that area is actually a city and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> uh and ultimate road yeah yeah all that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> all that heritage what i like about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ikebukuro is that you get a little bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of everything you know it's it's it it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> is kind of like you said that was so me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> me a little bit of everything a little </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> bit of everything everybody you do kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> of get a little bit of everything yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you just want to like go to an area </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and just you want to get some anime </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you've got oitamo </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah you've got some really really good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> restaurants and really really good bars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've got sunshine city </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> um yeah and then if you want a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like really good like southeast asian </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> restaurants and like indian restaurants </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you go to the west side of ikebukuro but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's also very scary at the west side </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah literally like i don't know what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happened okay yeah like the other side </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> is like literally just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> lots of sketchy places yeah to explain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you it you east side and west side um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not going to be able to easily </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wander from one side to the other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's literally east side and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> west side of the station so you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally have to go through the station </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get to either side right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and it's it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> it's such a big dichotomy that i don't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like it's literally a [ __ ] line that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> separates one like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the bougie side from like the really </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> really scat side and like i don't i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> don't know how like one station can </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> separate like two areas that are just uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> the complete opposite of each other it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> crazy on the train on the one side it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like oh you can eat oh all this and the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> other side it's like women 500 yen an </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hour yeah [ __ ] sex sex </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a lot of people and like uh and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like uh host clubs and stuff like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there's gonna be a lot of guys trying to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get you into a lot of girls bars yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> understand that you're saying you have a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] yeah yeah each side's good you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got a round one a really big round one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> very big round one yeah um and sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> shitty is a ton of malls yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah really good shopping really good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> food uh lots of fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around what round one is americans are </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> phone next to your table a lot of these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> places </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> like the beer on tap or the draft beer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or the craft beer default beer um that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just basically the only drink i ordered </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when i came to japan for the first time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> japanese very drinkable i'd say i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> wouldn't i wouldn't say it's the nicest </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> but just very easy it goes down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the thing about japanese beer is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's just very it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> refreshing you know what i mean because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was going to say it's like water but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's that's that's not doing it justice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know it's just very you know it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> not it's not american beer yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not it's like middle of light </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> necessarily it's not it's no middle like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> watery it's just refreshing you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because you could it's very light </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> without being without feeling like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a very cheap beer how do i yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it goes down really light but you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> still get the full taste of the beef </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah exactly i don't know how they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> do it's like some japanese wizardry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> happening but yeah like some of the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> refreshing beer i've had is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i guess this is a place that i also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> highly recommend we're going outside </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we're going way outside of tokyo now </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is in hokkaido uh because how do you get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to hokkaido where do i stay in hokkaido </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> where do you stay in hokkaido well i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only stayed near sapporo actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there are several ways to get to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hokkaido because hokkaido is uh hokkaido </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is pretty pretty damn big by the way is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the big island at the top you should you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> should go there because the food is the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> best and the drink is the best part </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know you can get there by train but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's pain in the ass from tokyo yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like four well i mean it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> four or five hours and you the last stop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is in hakodate which is oh yeah now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just fly look actually like it's i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like when i was stuck in hokkaido the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> price for the planes was actually </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> cheaper than the price with this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> like we're talking like if you want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> explore outside of tokyo maybe this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your second or you know second trip </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> third trip you've used or maybe you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just such an adventurer you may want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> go out or maybe yeah exactly maybe your </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> adventure you want to go out [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> highly recommend hokkaido oh yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sapporo is such a cool [ __ ] city it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> is it is bars yeah go and get uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> something called genghis khan </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] awesome dude it's all you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> eat normally sometimes if you're lucky </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> uh yeah lamb </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like korean barbecue with lamb but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a million times so because like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you're gonna come home you're gonna come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to japan uh and you're gonna cream your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pants at how [ __ ] good the food is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here and you're like my god this is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> peak cuisine how can it get better they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't get better and then you go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hokkaido and you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> how they improved on perfection and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hokkaido is like hold my sapporo yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i'll give you good food yeah like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know how hokkaido has just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> made like such good food even better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because all of the best japanese cuisine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've had has basically come from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hokkaido it's just in hokkaido like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> best ramen i've had his is in sapporo um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you want to seafood i've had it since </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah of course the best secret i've had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is in sapporo uh if you want to go if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're in sapporo and you want a good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just easily find like a ramen joint just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> go to ramen alley um because there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just a bunch of like different ramen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shops there and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> where i've had the best ramen i've ever </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> had in japan just like and like every </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> every every store there has like a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> different type of ramen </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> um and it's just they are all [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> amazing they're all [ __ ] bomb </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> um </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah just like hokkaido in general i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> think if you're gonna go i i we do </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> recommend the winter at least i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> recommend the winter um because there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a bunch of snow there looks aesthetic as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] winter wonderland yeah it is winter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wonderland that's where the snow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> festival was held your plane might get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> delayed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that is it forgot that is the one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> downside of going to hokkaido uh which </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is because it snows a lot you're kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> playing gacha with your plane like will </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you will your plane take off in time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> will it not will it get cancelled well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the entire airport shut down uh yeah the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fight find out find out when you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> basically go because you can never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> really plan around that unfortunately so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you can go to nissiko which is in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> opinion one of the best ski resorts in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just where we went it's [ __ ] great is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> amazing yeah it'll probably be rammed </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> with tourists oh yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean it's amazing though yeah really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good food i mean like i feel like i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> only been on two ski resorts now in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japan and nisiko is the superior one but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also it is very foreigner friendly yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so much so that you might have you might </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> encounter more foreigners than you will </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> japanese people yeah it's it's all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> aussies yeah it's all aussies it it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but then again that's that's almost all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> ski resorts in japan it's just all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> aussies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's good though really good area really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> really really good i've never been to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hakadate though what's that like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> thought it was chill without this chill </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> i like it the best crab in my life there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i think if you want the best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> seafood </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> because really yeah because it's a pool </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because that's where they catch all the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> seafood oh okay so they have a little </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> fish market in hakodate which is the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fish market you go there super early in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> the morning and you get literally the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> catch that they caught a couple of hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> prior </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> and it is amazing in my opinion the best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] seafood i've had yeah i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> even though seafood is amazing in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> hokkaido yeah i have to say and how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> about that it was like it was the best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> next level right so good so it's also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> really small like kind of quaint little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> town as well um you can get around very </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> easily with like the tram system that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> they have yeah um that's what that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what we do you can walk a lot around a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> lot of them center though you can you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> can but you can also go to like kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the nearby uh mountains as well and get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like a really nice view of huckled out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> there during the night um yeah really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> nice would you reckon guy where do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> record people should get the seafood </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> does any restaurants or do you want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do honestly yeah yeah i mean even it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> all decent yeah even like the hundred </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yen sushi places uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because the thing is like even if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you go to a big chain especially like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the conveyor belt sushis </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because the uh obviously the ingredients </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are locally sourced like just because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> even if you go to the same sushi chain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you might have been to in tokyo it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> will taste entirely different to another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sushi to the same sushi chain that you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have in you know in another place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so like even if you go to like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> conveyor belt sushi uh don't expect that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was taste exactly the same in tokyo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as it will in another place you go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i've had the ex i've had that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exact experience where i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> holy [ __ ] [ __ ] i didn't realize that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the quality could differ this much with </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the same chain oh yeah you think you go </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to mcdonald's you you get like most of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the time get the same experience every </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> time but yeah with sushi chains it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just you it's wildly different depending </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> no well not wildly because every the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> baseline is good right yeah the baseline </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> is good it it goes it goes from good to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] incredible yeah it's what i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> trying to say here i've never had food </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> poisoning from fish here it's always </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> been sausages so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> take that as scientific 100 percent </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> proof yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> it's not even chicken sashimi or it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> chicken it's the goddamn sausage no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah i think i've like one </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> uh one thing you don't you need to take </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> an account into account is that it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> actually like it's a lot harder than you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think to get from hakadate to sapporo if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you want to explore all of hokkaido oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's right i'd say it's practically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> impossible to explore all of hokkaido </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's just so massive those two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> well those two are like big major cities </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> without a car yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean i i i drove around hokkaido a bit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really fun i really recommend it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some really cool towns like toyota it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really cool was really nice yeah like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> the best supercar i've ever had in my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> life it's in toyota so good yeah because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> like the i think i think the drive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> between hakadate and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sapporo is like four hours or something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> three to four hours three to four hours </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> even with the train and we do two hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> with europe and most of the time it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just you're going through the mountains </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah which is really weird because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you you can really get tricked by the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> map right because you you go on google </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> maps and you go tokyo to hakadate which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like which is like that and it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three hours or four hours with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> shinkansen and then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> by the way huh that's not enough it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> not shinkansen the shinkansen stops at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hakodate oh okay okay no no no yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah two two hakadate it stops a hakka </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> data right so it's like three hours so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like oh okay that's not too bad and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> then uh you you're like okay maybe i can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> explore sapporo as well because it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just over just here it's just right next </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to hakadate and then you google hakadate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to sapporo and it's like four hours four </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and a half hours yeah to get like to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like that distance and you're like what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how does this make sense so uh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's something to keep in mind which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is uh it's a lot harder to explore all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of hokkaido than it may initially seem i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> think it's because when you're on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> mainland japan you're so used to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything being so much smaller like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the prefectures are way smaller all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the the towns are more likely they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely easy to get to easily to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to easier and then you realize that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> hokkaido in terms of prefectures is like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so much insanely larger than the next </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> biggest prefecture in japan that you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> kind of forget that like oh yeah this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> place is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] massive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> right it's like impossible to get around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah are there any any other places </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> outside of tokyo that's the obvious </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> count </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah are we gonna are we gonna talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> about kyoto and we are really nervous </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what is it like cancelled </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know if we can mention it man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> is still great to go if you're you're </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> going to go to osaka right because it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> a fun place yeah and you me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> might want to go to usj see the mario </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> world yeah you may as well go to kyoto </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's an hour away 40 minutes i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think right no it's like super duper 30 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minutes yeah yeah you may as well go to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> both uh kyoto is a [ __ ] nightmare to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> get around though i will say uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i know there's ways you can get around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with public transport but honestly if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're going there for a trip i'd say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just just taxi it around kyoto it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> super yeah so it's a lot cheaper to get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a taxi in kyoto and you can do way more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] because if you just taxi from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> places in kyoto you'll get so much more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> done </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i know that me and chris had like so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> many like major like tourist things in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> that one day yeah just because we just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> taxied everywhere yeah and did it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and uh the ryokans in uh kyoto are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> amazing obviously super traditional if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> you want that like super traditional </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> japan you're really good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like all those and then the good thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> is again osaka is only 30 minutes away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nara where you can feed the deers is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only like 45 minutes away you can go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> the other side you can go to shiga which </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> is near like uh biwaku which is japan's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> biggest inland lake that place is really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> lovely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> feels like underrated </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> iphone store of japan so everything is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> so minimal and clean yeah kyoto is so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> impeccable how do you think it's going </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> to be when the country opens up and we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> get tourists i'm scared i've only ever </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> been to kyoto with no tourists yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> because i've been to kyoto with tourists </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's hell because like the reason i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> was just like do we want to talk about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> kyoto is just because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i mean like people people will want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go obviously but it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even more probably like when tourists </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when the country opens back up it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to be even more of a tourist trap </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than tokyo is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> i think that's what it seems like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is extremely popular with chinese </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> tourists yeah because uh he's a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> historians i went during chinese new </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> year and it was oh my god oh my god it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like literal shoulder </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because like kyoto yeah it's a cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> place it's not like the place that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not my vibe when it comes to travel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because it's like it's going to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so busy so packed and you're going to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> lining up for like uh for like the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] 10th temple that you've seen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that day or something like that and i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just like you know what maybe like maybe </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we can skip this temple i just i i i go </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> somewhere i just want some nice food i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> get it it's not for everyone but i love </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it a lot of people love it um yeah like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> i recommend the places around kyoto more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than kyoto itself kyoto is like a good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> base hub i've been together a few times </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> in the past two years i gotta say my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> enjoyment of kyoto depended on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weather </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right kyoto gets so hot it does in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> summer it's unbearable yeah i just i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> wouldn't even bother going to oh my god </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in summer i just i genuinely i tell </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people i'm like just don't don't come in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> august you're not gonna have fun yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> come </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> between </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> october just come just come just come </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> come right now come throughs you want to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> come </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> come between october and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> april </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i would mostly agree with you except of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> the existence of okinawa okay if you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> gonna occur but how many people are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> going to get okinawa like not that many </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of people okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> here's here's here's the thing because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's where i recommend tokyo sucks in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the summer </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i will fully agree with conor because if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you're going to go to japan to go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just okinawa then [ __ ] go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> southeast asian countries like there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so many [ __ ] beaches there you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> okinawa is where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> we go when we live in japan because we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> don't have [ __ ] off our we colonize this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> island bizarre </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean okinawa is where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is uh is where we go if you live in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> japan to get to like a good beach </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because there's not many choices when it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comes to good beaches here in japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately god forbid mainland japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> is a good beach yeah because i'm in like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> shimoda and stuff </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it has a bunch i don't know my standard </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> of beaches is very high yeah oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so i don't know and i feel okinawa </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is the only place that fits my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> australian standard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i was raised in like some of the best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> beaches in the world </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah japan doesn't have a lot of choices </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it comes to beaches uh funny for an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> island nation but then again i'm from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> england as well and we have the exact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> same problem so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i i would argue that okinawa is not only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> great for the beaches but you know kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> of very similar to hokkaido where like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the food that you can get in okinawa is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like next level i've never actually been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to okinawa yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but i've only seen like the spam sushi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know like spam sushi is like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know more famous one but like there's so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> many there's so many like traditionalist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> okinawan uku style foods that are just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so good and i mean like the booze in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> okinawa as well like you know because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like in in a hokkaido you have sapporo </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> bee yeah right which is like you drink </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> saparabhi in hokkaido it's like poor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> classic support class which you can only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> get in like hokkaido for some reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah whereas in okinawa there's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> specific type of beer called an orion b </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or an orion b however you want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pronounce it and orion b in sapporo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in okinawa is probably just as not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> worthy as a sapporo in hokkaido you said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> onion beer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and then you cut the onion cut the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> onions </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> or it's spelled orion but it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pronounced </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> orion beer is it's it's like a okinawa </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> specific beer and that on like a summer </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> day in okinawa is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> god tea okay it's so good and just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> okinawan food in general if you want </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> like a different kind of twist on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japanese food that you can't really get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anywhere else i would definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> recommend okinawan food yeah and there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plenty of okinawa based restaurants in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> tokyo as well like there's there's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really good one in nikki actually in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sunshine city i go to quite a bit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> um so if you want like a different take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on japanese food i recommend knocking on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> food yeah i mean i mean speaking of food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um a lot of people come here or at least </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of anime come anime fans come here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> expecting to uh enjoy like the weeb </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> aspect and then pretty much everyone i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> talk to they come to japan and they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like i stay for the food oh yes the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> food collection </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah yeah right right you spend </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> your money on food if you're gonna spend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your money on something i i know it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to be hard walking through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> akihabara and you can see some cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime figures spend your money on a good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> meal you will not [ __ ] regret it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it'll be the best meal you've probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> had in your entire life yeah what kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of things you guys recommend people try </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out when they're here not ichiran not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> each one right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> now no no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> go to a job go to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wherever you are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> find the filthiest grossest looking </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ramen place most likely the ramen will </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> be a ten out of ten yes or one i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's you know no it's always no no it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> never a one it's never a one the ones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the ones that have the [ __ ] neon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> signs look really pretty on the outside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> they're just covering the fact that the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> food is made yeah and the thing is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> might look intimidating because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously it looks very traditional you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know how to order most of the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it there will be a machine right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a ticket machine and all you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to do is put your money in and uh if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're having trouble you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> figuring out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh what the orders are because there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> normally like only like four ramens to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> choose from anyway so that's the good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> places yeah those are the good places </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the less choice you have on the menu the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more like the better chance it's going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be that it's gonna [ __ ] bomb </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh because that that means that this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> family or the the person running the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> restaurant has just like perfected their </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> christmas they've perfected it they've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sharpened their craft you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah um but most of the time you're only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna have like three or four ramens to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pick from you can like use the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> google translate thing uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hack that uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> life hack that we use um if you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having trouble but it's not it's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not that um intimidating at all so you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just choose you choose your meal maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you go with the gyoza as well maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're doing beer with it um and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you just give your tickets to the ramen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guy and he'll give you your order that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty much it and it's the bit and it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably the best [ __ ] ramen you'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> ever have in your life yeah honestly uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like we just said earlier convey about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sushi i actually prefer conveyor belt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sushi a lot of the times to the more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> expensive sushi chains and sushi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> restaurants i think i think it depends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for me like i i don't mind going to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more expensive ones maybe like once or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> twice a year but if i just want like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> consistently like good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sushi then yeah there's nothing wrong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> because there's a lot of places that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they're just like lunch sets that are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like 2 000 yen you get like a bunch of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff that's true because you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right in front of you here's the reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why like because with conveyor belt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sushi like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> such a good value for money yeah and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember the first time coming to japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just thinking like the sushi is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing because it [ __ ] is amazing i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wanted to stuff myself full with as much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sushi as i could eat and you can't do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> that with expensive changes i prefer the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ones with the conveyor belts but you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> order and then it comes out on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> conveyor belt because that's most places </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now yeah yeah i know there are still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> some that have like the rotating ones oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah it's just like i would rather </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> have the freshly prepared one yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so with a lot of conveyor belt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> brands or places that we that you go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um they'll have a system where some of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> them some of them will literally like be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> automated where they'll have a plate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that gets like shot to you on like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] and yeah the first thing is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> usually yeah it's usually shaped like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> bullet train yeah yeah yeah right it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like so thematically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so cool it's so cool and uh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like i to this day i still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i still eat as much conveyable sushi as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i can because i think it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> amazing i love i love stuffing myself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> forward sushi and i can't do that at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more expensive restaurants i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> sushi's good sushi's good but at the end </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> of the day it's just fish rice wasabi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> right it's fish fries from wasabi and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's i also think you should try the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> foreign food here like try to see what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their takes are on uh foreign foods it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> quite interesting they do some really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> good foreign food here yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> italian food especially time food's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> really good here yeah there's some good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> really good burgers different from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh italian food in europe it's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> good though like imagine that you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that some some restaurants combine the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> techniques of uh you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> italian chefs but use japanese </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> ingredients which uh is can be really </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] impressive </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> uh it's maybe not the most authentic </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> thing but you get something new </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> especially the fish here yeah yeah oh my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> god fish dishes in japan and italian </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> food are like next [ __ ] levels yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> definitely holy [ __ ] the best kind of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> fusion oh so good what do you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> about them trying wagyu beef </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah try it try it i mean you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> the thing is there's so many different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> types of wagons when you've lived here </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> long enough i feel like you you kind of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> go off wag you yeah you're like i kind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of want more meat than fat yeah but the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> first time you have it it's like a like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> a [ __ ] like what the [ __ ] this is an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> explosion in your mouth </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of that flavor it's food wars it's based </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> on like yeah pretty much yeah eating </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> wagyu his mouth is just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like where's like the best place to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> wagyu if you don't know what you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> looking for though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's really hard yeah go anywhere in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> kobe i guess and just get kobe beef </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> there well let's let's let's assume like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> every single prefecture in japan like we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have our own beef that is good i think i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> think i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> in takayama is probably the best like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> type of wagyu i've had right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> kobe beef is like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> it's good but it's so fatty at times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you're just like oh my god i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know if i'm eating like a piece of fat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or not yeah you're just eating butter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> basically yeah basically you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> americans you love them you'd love that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> right yeah americans love it like saying </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like teppanyaki you always get like you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> can always get like wagyu </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah tampon yaki's pretty good it also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just depends on how it's prepared as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well a lot of times but like what i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really like about like hidaku for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> example is that like they literally just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like put a bunch like cubes over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> basically just on a stick put it on top </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of a fire just put some salt and pepper </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on that [ __ ] and boom it's like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> best [ __ ] food you'll ever have and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> they sell it as street food i mean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> chris's favorite food yakitori as well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> yakitori is good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> again like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> kind of wrong did you feel like the best </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> types of yakitori are the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> all-you-can-eat ones or do you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they should go to like a more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> traditional yakitori place i think both </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are pretty good i think if it's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> first time you're experiencing that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're probably not going to be able to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> taste the difference i think the only </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> ones who are like you know go only opt </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to go to like say the more </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> traditionalist ones yeah the ones who </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> have just had so much [ __ ] tori </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> kizoku that they're just like all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let me just try and be you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> if you really want to try those kind of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> place though you really need to do need </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> to learn the names though yes yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because a lot of those places don't have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> a menu </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> oh yeah that's true because they just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you just walk up it's literally just a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> counter and a dude standing there just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> infinitely cooking chicken and you just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have to say that just saying that's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> best one is the best one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> the layers dude they taste so good japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> does nikki based food so well oh dude </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's so good yeah it's really really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> good i can just plow down on like 50 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like negatives yeah i just i guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> chris always wants the sugar i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> soukiness just i love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the meatballs yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i love it i love it like why bastardize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this this chicken dude just give me the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bastardize the chicken rip it apart and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shove it back together talking about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> just grind it apart and make it into a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ball that's great it's just like it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> not the only time i will accept boneless </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> chicken </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] ground chicken the reason why i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't like it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's almost like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like negimo is the perfect balance </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> between meat and veg right you get one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> bite of chicken and veg right yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> perfect soup in it just pure like just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ground meat and i'm like this is too </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> much but like i like that because it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it more evenly spreads the seasoning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right because it's it's seasoned in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> ground meat right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i mean i i just i kind of want a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> variation you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> well you know that's the great thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> about yakitori right different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> structures yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> calorific ones there's like ones where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we like it's uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> meat filled with cheese pork belly i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> highly recommend pork belly as well if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um yeah i mean that's the like again you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that's what i order if i don't want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have something like wagyu beef but you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> still want that like explosion of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> flavor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in your mouth like that perfect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what would you say then is the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> underrated japanese food for people to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> try when it comes to japan right because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like everyone obviously everyone knows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> that they're going to go to a sushi </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> place they're going to go to like an </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> izakaya but like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh the one that no one ever talks about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> unani niki's like the boss dude i was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna say unagi as well yeah yeah please </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> try unagi it is expensive it is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> expensive it is expensive but it's worth </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's an experience okay because like i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> remember i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> explaining to my mom how i'm like really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into unagi but i had to explain to her </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that uh it's uh eel right yeah she's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh yeah people why'd you like eat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> well that's disgusting and that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> because like her perception of eating </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> eel is like jellied eels oh yeah i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> just like my god like the living in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> uk has to like ruined your perception of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> this [ __ ] s-tier food so it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the way it's prepared is that it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> grilled and then it's like smoked i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think as well yes yeah and so it's it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't it's not slimy it's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> kind of like you know when you grill a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> fish and it's kind of like nice and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> crumbly and dry and and then they s the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> way they season and sauce this bad boy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not tried that's the thing it's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> somehow moist it's it's moist it's good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it's just like it has like the uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> consistency of like fish and it's like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> perfectly a perfectly good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> uh perfectly good like flavorful moist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fish you put that on a bed of rice i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like i feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's some really cheap places you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get it but i'd say the places that cost </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> around two to three thousand yen for a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> box are probably like the places where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> you'll get some really good ones yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i've gone to places where they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> charged like seven thousand yen seventy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> bucks which i've got a place where it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like a hundred bucks for yeah and it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's like damn it's good can you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> tell the difference in the taste though </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah i so i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it's weird man within an aggie it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> i feel like the the subtleness of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> flavors especially the fish yeah when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you get it cheap it's so harsh the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> flavor yeah yeah whereas like the good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ones the sauce is kind of light the fish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like the eel is just really i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> don't know how to describe it [ __ ] it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know do you know what i mean i i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> know exactly i know you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i don't know it kind of like the skin </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> also the texture of the skin on the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> cheek places is like really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh rough yeah rough and kind of yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it makes you feel like you're eating </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> something fishy whereas normally when </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's good or naggy it doesn't remind you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it doesn't feel like you're eating fish </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it feels like you're eating meat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah which is like the weirdest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comparison yeah it's it's like a meaty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> fishy kind of it's like it's like a meat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and fish combo yeah the best way imagine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah you have to try do you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> ever get like ubereats unagi i've had it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> a bunch uh it's generally at meh yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> i'd say you've got to go to a restaurant </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you're in japan you're probably not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> getting ubereats so don't worry about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't waste your time with uber i will </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say sometimes that if it's a nice unagi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> place you might have to reserve </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> unanimity takes a while to cook yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like uh a lot of places especially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're out there summer summer yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a summer food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> primarily but you can get in winter it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> still good yeah the places in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> countryside outside of tokyo normally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always have to call in advance yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tell them that you're coming or that you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to book because it takes i think at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> least an hour or two to cook it yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> though because it's smoked and stuff so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it takes a while it's really really good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really really recommend it yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> people don't really talk about it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because people don't like the idea of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> eels </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i'm always hyping it up though i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> love it yeah i mean i guess for me if i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't say unagi uh if you are going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like a more expensive uh seafood place i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> really like uni i mean yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> i know connor i know connor hates it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> but i've uni has like really grown on me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> since i've moved to japan like really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really yeah i just like okay you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how favorite you know how you know they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> say like if you if you take a seashell </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> with you and you put your ear against it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you can hear the ocean and hear the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scene so me eating uni is like eating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> the seeds it's like tasting this it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like it's you know like if the she had </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> poop and you ate it it would be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> if the seeds were like the best flavored </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> poop if if if that's if that is true </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> poop just just i i i guess </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i'm a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> i guess i'm about to play euphoria all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over again baby because i i am a seed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> lover if you know what it is it's on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> screen right now it says orange looking </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> paste thingy you'll you'll recognize it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it always stands out in the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sushi yeah everything it looks like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> one of these things is not like the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it looks it's so refreshing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you'll know which camp you're in yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when you try it please let me know to be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> fair </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think out of like the almost like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe 10 to 20 people that i've taken to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a sushi place and they've tried uni i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> think like like 75 of them ended up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> liking it yeah what i think it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> most people i think are very thrown off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> with how it looks i spoke to dadas and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> emily and they were like yeah they were </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like let's go to a sushi place like sure </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the one place i don't want to go is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if they have too much uni </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and i was like don't worry i hate uni </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> too </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yes that's so good no taste no taste no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> taste but oh yeah like i i really really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like uni and i even if you don't like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i recommend you try it out because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a very unique flavor it's very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> refreshing it's nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's nowhere on the same level as like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something like [ __ ] natto or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> something like that where it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> weird foods it's a very subtle flavor </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> subtle it's like a it's a bomb going off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no it's not what no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like refreshing it's like eating </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the ocean it's like it's like a salty </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> creamy type of like you know nice flavor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that goes yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so weird because you literally look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> at the sea urchin and just like how the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] anything edible come out of that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like what the hell is this they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> crack it open gold </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> gold of the ocean </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> um okay i would probably recommend then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um what japan does really [ __ ] well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when when we think of meat based foods </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in japan you know most people are pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> quick to go like uh you know wagyu and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff like that i think they're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> tonkatsu in japan oh yeah it's god tiff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] which is uh which is uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> uh fried no not fried well deep yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> like pork dude if you ever go to gunma </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> holy [ __ ] these things are like yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they look like they're fighting back </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> thick pieces of pork it's so good though </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> oh there's this really good chain in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> tokyo </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i'm going to call my sin yeah oh my set </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> dude my son is god here uh did i took </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> you there yeah i told connor and it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like 40 bucks though but like holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> but it is the best poor color you'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> ever have oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> my gosh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah pork cutlet like there's there's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> nothing that can be like a fresh pork </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> cutlet hungover it's my go-to yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's just like shrimp has the egg [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the texture is just godly you bite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in and it's all crispy and then you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the rich inside it's nice and juicy oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> my god [ __ ] me out god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you can have it by itself or there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> another really like cool way to eat it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> which i like which is katsudon yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> which is like where you like put it in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> an egg and like have some money people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that are a better right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not a fan of katsudon really because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like to me to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to me part of my like one of my favorite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> things about tonkatsu is the texture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right but when you put it on the egg it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just like it gets rid of that crunch to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it no but like it's written but that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> replaced with the [ __ ] amazing like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> egg and like pork flavored </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all that turns your </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> it's that crunch it's that fresh crunch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just it's it's just godly and by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> putting egg over it you get a fresh one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you can get like the crunch with the egg </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and the sauce and the you got them you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gotta you have the cuts on the licen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dude it has the crunch i can't believe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you just tell me what it is i can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> believe it tell you what it tell you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> what it is it's it's like putting milk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in your cereal all right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> you get rid of the texture you i like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> that crunch i like that fresh crunch </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> chatted on is better than the normal uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> cause you get the egg the egg and the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> onions are a game changer but with the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> rice because when you get the perfect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ratio of of meat egg rice and onions in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one bite it's like it's like food wars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> levels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's the best i don't know what go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on god's little baby though god's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> dude gonna ask questions like do you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> peel your crayons before you eat it like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yes like i don't know don't don't trust </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean i mean it's it's it's it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> prayer it's a preference thing it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> preference i've got so to me to me the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> best thing about tonkatsu is to eat [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is that [ __ ] what you do no no no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no he's got good taste because he likes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> uni natto all right you want to side </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with a guy who says old bread tastes the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but i will agree uni and nato has gone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> live they're [ __ ] godlike yeah but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> again like i would like to argue there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is so much more to japanese cuisine than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sushi and wagyu like yeah go ahead eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the sushi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and ramen right all [ __ ] amazing but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you go out there and try out some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other like lesser-known stuff and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like we only just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scratched the surface there is plenty of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe maybe you're like oh [ __ ] i [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> with economics </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know takoyaki as well you know it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of chooses uh yeah some people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> really like it some people don't there's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> some really nice restaurants actually </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> that do it that are like really good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> prices </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it i mean it's street food right but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> there are some restaurants that do it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> amazingly but if you're gonna have some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the best okonomiyaki and takoyaki </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially you've got to go to osaka </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that's true yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the best the okonomiyaki the best </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> okonomiyaki i had was in osaka in like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this like really shitty downtown </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where like five people could fit in it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was [ __ ] amazing well the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> thing is it's just like i feel like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rule with asian food is that if you buy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it on the streets or if it looks [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dirty that food is gonna [ __ ] be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing and then and that rule is also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> consistent in japan as well if you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the if you have the opportunity to buy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> street food it's not it's normally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] amazing yeah i've got a question </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what about conbini food where does that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> come into this combini food um company </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> food is an experience i think that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really fun for the first couple of days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah obviously you're gonna want </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're gonna want to save some money and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> spend some money on restaurants but i'd </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> say yeah yeah you could definitely gotta </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> try to food's still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> great compared to everywhere else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because i'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm like compared to the rest of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> world compared to the restaurant because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like i'm remembering when i first came </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to japan i'm just like damn i can live </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> out of 7-eleven and family my entire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> life and i did for like a good few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> months and didn't get bored you guys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lived off conveniently like onigirian </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> sandwiches yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because like compared to like the food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> we have uh like [ __ ] tesco's or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> okay listen right these sandwiches are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> good they're decent but these sandwiches </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> aren't better than the ones i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reserving my judgment i still have yet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to try a tesco meal deal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> i know for a fact i know when we go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> the uk for god's wedding later right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i'm going to try it out and i'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> see which side i'm he's pretty scared </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because i know for a fact you're going </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> to like the tesco meal deal more okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like comparing tesco food to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> combini food it's it's nowhere near it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> nowhere near yeah okay first of all joe </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> here's i'm going to tell you first of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> all sandwiches actually have crust on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> them okay that already wins all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what do you what what what do you want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you don't want a sandwich </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> no i'm not saying i'm okay i'm just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> saying the sandwich is about it all </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> right okay that's that's not an argument </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm saying conbini food in general would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you want what do you want if you want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> tesco muddy but you don't want a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sandwich get a salad sorry it's decent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it's not great i'm looking at a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> cornbread [ __ ] salad pasty if you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on pasta it's a cold pasty a cold pasta </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like a pork ball with batter </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> egg no egg in the middle yeah you gotta </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> you gotta compare that to like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> good good fried chicken </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but the sandwich game is absolutely </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> appalling i still like them yeah but the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uk sandwiches are like it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> like the sandwich there's the sandwich </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> in kombini's section is like one one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> tiny section compared to like literally </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> what's up with that why is that a meal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> deal why is that a drink get your own </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> tea get a sandwich and a little snack </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because you have an infinite amount of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> choice yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like just called going to the food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> section at a convenience also i don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like in japan how it's really hard to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> get a normal sized bag of crisps like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> they're all big sized right you notice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that yeah it's like you can't you talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> about like the small you can't just have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> like one portion of crisp it's like you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> have you're committing to like three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bags yeah would it be fair to be fair </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> though like when you when you do buy the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> big ones though like 60 of it is air </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> which is probably the equivalent to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> one small sized bag of chips so yeah but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i mean like if especially if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> come from england uh i think connor's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> romanticized tesco muir deals absolutely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not because you got these sandwiches and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh if you go to the company you also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> have sandwiches but you also have like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> onigiri fried chicken you have some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> yakitori sticks you got bentos </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i don't [ __ ] with the yakitori sticks at </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> conbini's i wouldn't get them you won't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> get them so you get like you get like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've got fried chicken beef balls have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> the sausages there before </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> did you get food poisoning from them i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> did not i've had the 7-eleven like not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> corn dogs the ones like just hot dogs on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> a stick yeah it's all right the corn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dogs at 7-eleven are kind of all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> no i've never had one i i like corn dogs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> it's hard to [ __ ] up a corn dog if you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> go to a mini stop which you won't see </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> often they have soft serves they are the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> rarest yeah although many stop soft </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> serves are godliness yeah yeah like they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> specialize in soft surf and it's it's it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> goes hard but finding it but like mini </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> stops are like the ssrs yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> i think in tokyo i think it's only like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> 0.5 percent of companies in tokyo are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> mini stops most of them i feel like are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> around like shinjuku weirdly i see a lot </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i know there's one like up north </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> where i used to live but that was very </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> rare they get though i was very happy i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> lived near a mini stop i was like oh yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i've pulled the ssr let's go babies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so much just so you're supposed to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> choice with food and how about however </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> much you want to spend you can spend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah i guess we've gotten a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the basic things out of the way of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your first visit to japan what if what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if someone has a little bit more time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and has been to japan a few times where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would you guys recommend that they go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> well i mean i you know we did this the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> shima nami kaido which is on the cycling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> special honestly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that inland sea area is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> beautiful gorgeous [ __ ] incredible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i've really really since the cycling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> special i really want to go back there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i really want to go back there and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do the route again basically just just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look at the spike this just look at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cycling special and just look how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] beautiful it was because the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> best thing about it is that like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> have you know all of like hiroshima </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's near there you have right next to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that there's a prefecture called okayama </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah uh where i went there for a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's this like little small town </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> called kuroshki which is like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really [ __ ] cool retro style town </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that's just basically just like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> hill that overlooks the inland sea and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so [ __ ] gorgeous and then if you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> want to cross that inland sea and go to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like shikoku uh yeah you have places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like ehime which is really like kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> down to earth and like kind of chill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> not the most it's not the most exciting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> thing but like if you're a little bored </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like yeah if you're a little bored of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like the kind of whole city life of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tokyo and stuff like that in the main </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cities uh that's really really nice yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and if uh if watching the cycling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> special kind of like intimidated you uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't worry you don't need to do the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> entire route in a day um if i was to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it again i would definitely not do it in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a day you can also rent a car just drive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> across you can also rent a car but if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you also want to keep healthy you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> keep keep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know work out those muscles then i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do actually highly i highly recommend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the cycling route um i highly recommend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you doing that in uh two days maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three days you know how well if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now that you think back what was what do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you think is like the optimal time you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> would recommend i would call that a day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> we still do in a day yeah i reckon if i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't want to be hurting i'd say at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> least two days i think it was just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> annoying because we were filming i think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it would have been not pretty fun if you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> could just power up there's a couple of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the islands in between where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> admittedly there isn't a whole lot going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on but like the first couple of islands </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh you know that's like closer to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> hiroshima there's like still a really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like cool like town vibe to it and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know there's like a lot of like cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> beaches there as well so if you go yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah it's like there's some genuinely </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> nice beaches there's a fit you are i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> guess if you really aren't fit at all i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> wouldn't yeah maybe just stick to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> first island yeah yeah yeah but you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're somewhat active and you you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> know you'll have no problem cycling then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah i'd just do it on one day it's very </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> you can also just cycle around hiroshima </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> as well yeah yeah i mean honestly it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like some of the most beautiful views </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've had in japan yeah i'm not saying a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot because a lot of japan is photogenic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> so it's a bit unfair i mean i i guess </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> sticking on that vein um if you want to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> go see mount fuji um i do recommend </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> going to one of the lakes around there i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> can't remember the name exactly but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> school how good should you go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like we like lake kawaguchiko is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like you can also cycle around there you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can rent a bike me and you've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gone on a date where we've rented the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bike and just cycled around the entire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's kind of unfair where you go to a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> place and everything looks photoshopped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though it's real like you you take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a picture there we've taken a bunch of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pictures there i don't know we've uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when the last time we went there was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh we went camping right when we went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> camping yeah and luke took a bunch of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pictures and we took a bunch of pictures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and everyone took a bunch of pictures </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and nowhere </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> i know and no matter what it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> impossible to take a bad picture it just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> looked like a postcard especially when </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's clear yeah yeah yeah yeah which it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> was when we went very lucky yeah but um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah i don't know because like i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> remember when we did the journey across </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> japan two to mount fuji yeah a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people thought that by the end of it we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had just like green screened ourselves </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in front of it because it just looked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that good it's it's it's so weird being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in that place and you just like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally look like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i let you feel like i'm looking at the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> green screen or like it's this is a this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> is a screen saver right like a desktop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah i'm looking at a screen saying i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> waiting for the pipes animation to see </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's it's so surreal that a place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can look that photogenic but just exist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in real life without any uh without any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> plug-ins or any uh any photoshop edits </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> on no yeah yeah yeah no rtx on well it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> probably one of the places you might </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> want to drive though it's kind of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> annoying to go by train and stuff yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there isn't a whole lot of traffic i'd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say like outside of the major cities </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like osaka um tokyo sapporo and stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that um driving this driving is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> your best friend you literally like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll have such a hard time if you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to do it by public transport as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> probably is uh experience because you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> only do all by public transport yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah actually uh on that vein i guess an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> app i highly recommend uh is the app </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that we use is a dd </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> which um there are there is like a few </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> taxi apps in japan uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> taxi but uh dd is the most i guess </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> foreigner friendly because it's you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh full english so it's all english so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> except for any card yeah it will accept </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> any card with with other apps it's been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really finicky with the types of cards </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> that it will accept japan taxi and go </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> taxi whatever it is now oh yeah god it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> is i have a japanese card and she keeps </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> denying it really i have a japanese card </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it denies it i have it so annoying i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have a foreign card it denies it i have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like cards from like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like thailand and the uk and it's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like it doesn't want to accept anything </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it doesn't accept anything so i don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know what card it will accept </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um so yeah i like highly recommend dd </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> over uber here would you say sorry </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because i know you can use uber if you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> want yeah you can use uber but uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> whatever you're comfortable with yeah i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> think i think dd is i think there's more </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> taxis on dd um yeah and it's and it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> the best in between because dd is not as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> popular as a japanese app like go taxi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but it is still way more friendly if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately uber is just not really a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing here no uber uber ubereats is but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like the actual uber i know i know some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people who use it religiously yeah um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but mainly for food i guess yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> also hailing cabs is really really easy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially in tokyo if you you know if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're confident enough and just telling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> them where to go uh it's really easy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah obviously that's a big if yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> understand it's at all but i think for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the most part if you're in tokyo the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> train system is just so convenient you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> probably google very rarely will have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't try to learn the maps just use </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> google maps yeah it's pretty simple it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> routes it out for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is absolutely lying google literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knows the best route i'm i'm i wish that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people would shut up being like i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> the streets better no you don't google </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> google has every [ __ ] satellite in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> existence and billions of data it knows </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> whether to be fair there has been times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where i've looked at google and i'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nah dude you're going you're gonna like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> deal you're gonna like the aesthetic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> route sometimes sometimes google wants </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to like make your life easier to a point </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> where it's like listen it's just quicker </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> if i just walk yeah yeah yeah they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like no no we're gonna make it so you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't walk it um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but generally for if you're only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> getting you're gonna have to change </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three different trains if you wanna get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a to z google will generally tell you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the best way and you could tell it to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> fewer changes or more changes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's i've it's never failed me in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tokyo yeah even outside of tokyo i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> driving i use it for driving i use it i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> bought one of those shitty little things </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> on amazon that you stick on like the air </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> fans oh yeah yeah phone hold your phone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah man yeah it's good i'm good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is there any other places you guys would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> recommend a bit out of the box </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i've never been to kyushu i already </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> think joey is good kyushu is great uh i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i think kyushu is underrated as hell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah um i one place i really really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> liked in kyushu was um kumamoto yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah where aso is the volcano mount also </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is yeah but like i think kumamoto is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> really cool because it's like it's again </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this like huge like volcanic caldera but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's also like it weirdly reminds me a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> lot of like the kind of like plain uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> open plain places that i went to a lot </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> in like australia and like in england </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that yeah it doesn't look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like japan right and it's so weird but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's really really cool if you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your like kind of mountainous areas it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really dope and also you're really close </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like nagasaki as well which is a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really dope city um nagasaki is a super </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cool city that's like very like vintage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel it has like a very european feel as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> well because like a lot of the a lot of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> like european settlers came in and out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> of nagasaki um </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah i don't know kyushu i think is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> really underrated has some really good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> food as well as one of the game yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's really cool yeah i still haven't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been to kyushu as well you can go to as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> well which has the other really massive </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> onsen area </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> mean to hiroshima it's like five hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's not even in kyushu yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah i mean like i guess one place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i don't really hear people talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about is obviously like if you're a wine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> lover like me and sydney are uh you can </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> go to the wine capital of japan even </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> though like wines not as well known here </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but i mean we discovered the place </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> because we're not like i'm not a big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> sake fan </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm not a massive sake fan but there are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plenty of places to try sake in tokyo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and basically anywhere you go into japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but if you want to have a little taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of the japanese wine culture here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's not very well talked about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you go to koshu valley it's in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yamanashi prefecture which is like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can literally make it a day trip oh you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wanted to um it's like just about like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> an hour an hour and a half out of tokyo </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh you can literally just go on on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> jr line and go to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go to the stops around kosher valley um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there is one place i do recommend if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are interested uh i believe the building </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is called budo budonooka i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah um great hill yeah yeah great grave </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hill um i believe that's the place uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because that's the place i've talked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about before where you can go in and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> they have a wine cellar with about a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> hundred different wines you pay 13 bucks </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and you can try as many wines as you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like and uh </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_07> it's basically like all throughout </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> niigata it's just like all really really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> nice like sake based on something </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to it yeah so if you like sake go to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> niigata if you like wine go to yamaha </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but also in the negative vending </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> machines the there's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like nectar of the gods </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> it's wonderful it's just like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> sugary goodness oh it's so good it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> very good it's so bad for you though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like 100 sugar watching yume is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bit too sweet for my palate otherwise i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably would like i couldn't drink it </SPEAKER_01>
