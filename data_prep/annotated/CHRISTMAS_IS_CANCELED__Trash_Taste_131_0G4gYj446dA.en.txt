<SPEAKER_03> can't just rock up at a store and buy a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> phone now you have to book yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which sucks because it's like what if my </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> this booking I say I want to buy the new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Google pixel uh Seven Pro whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though I already don't really like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> phone right now it will not work with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your current Sim unless you get a sim </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that can only work on this phone so I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like how does that make any [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sense are they trying to sell you a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> phone or they wouldn't sell me the phone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at all no these because I had to have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A or a plan only for their carrier but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like did they not give you like other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> options being like but what you can do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is they were like get the [ __ ] out oh my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> God they were like sorry nothing no can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> do yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean you went through all that trouble </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> after a booking yeah and I'm like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I saw your Visa like illegal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> immigrants obviously obviously you don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> deserve a phone I'm just like okay fine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] me so my phone's broken I can't do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> anything about it okay so now I I then I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> afterwards I was like fine I'll go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll go to like one of the other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> characters areas and I'll see what I can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do yeah yeah and they were like oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because your Visa is expiring well it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about to expire on paper it looks like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no no carrier will will let you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> join so basically even though I already </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have two more Sims with docomo for my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> streaming bag they wouldn't give me one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they did however docomo they did say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were like hey once you if you buy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an unlocked phone from Google again and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you come back to us we can give you a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sim the tethers hey talk about the goat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I was like all right and they said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> best of all because you have you already </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have two sims with us if you have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> third with us we'll give you 10 discount </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> all the Sims and I was like oh music in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my ears so I'm gonna I'm gonna [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cancel my softbanks in the moment I get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right I get I get my Visa honestly I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> think I think like locked phones are a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] scam why why yeah why why are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> phones locked to a network this is right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this is what I've always bought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> unlocked phones yeah I'm like I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to deal with this this locked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> contract [ __ ] yeah but Japan has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> designed a system that will punish you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for trying to do that like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously you can do it and some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> providers do it but all the big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> corporations and the big networks really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't want you to do it they do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything in their power to not make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you do it which is fine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if it wasn't hard enough already to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a sim plan like it's it's hard like in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the UK you can you can order a Sim which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I did like uh for some of my friends I I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ordered them Sims from the UK that they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shipped to Japan the company shipped it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to Japan ready so that when you come to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the UK it'll work it's unlocked work on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any phone I think I think the issue with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of these like Japanese companies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is the fact that their main like Market </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> base is just Japanese people who are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably never going to use another SIM </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they're just like in Japan the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll travel is like [ __ ] I mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why would they need why would you wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so you're going to buy a phone but why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> would you need another Sim you're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going anywhere they've made a system so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stressful even compared to like the like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> English contract and stuff like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um that is so [ __ ] to deal with that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll just never question it and you'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just keep yeah get upgrading your phone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll be like I don't want to deal with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it having to do this [ __ ] again yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this just sucks it's just a simple like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> solution right yeah yeah you don't want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to deal with it where it's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's kind of all about brand loyalty at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that point which I feel like is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> ingrained in a lot of them is to go man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I travel your life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when I bought my other two sims they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> were like no questions asked give this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man two SIM cards you know let's just do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it right now I do also find it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> interesting how like going back to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> having a book an appointment at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> SoftBank because of like covert </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restrictions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are we not beyond that point at this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> point Japan isn't like Japan Japan is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> still incredibly still so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> paranoid about it because like I because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I went back to the gym recently after </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh you know and like the local gym I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I went to like you can you know they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously like oh you can like use the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> app to see like how many people are at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the gym right now in case you don't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like you know yeah full or </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> but I think when it comes to exercise I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think you know there should be some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> leeway there where it's like hey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when you're doing cardio yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just yeah and it is annoying that at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> least Anytime Fitness in Japan it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't well at least there's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] millions of signs right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same don't worry but most people I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> seen don't some people do it's weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> seeing who does and doesn't in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right as a foreigner it's like all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people expect me to not follow the rules </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like whatever but it's weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's odd seeing which Japanese people uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> follow the rules and I've noticed the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> more ripped someone is in the gym in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan the less likely they are to wear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> their mask I'm not kidding they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> absolutely who's going to tell them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who's gonna stop I'm not kidding you the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> absolute Giga chat's in the gym don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wear masks I'm not this is not this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay I I'm this is not me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> being like do real men don't wear it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I've just noticed that the more rip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone is in Japan the more the mess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> might be like down here or down here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know you know and people who tend to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be more timid I've noticed that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's weird that's weird I've noticed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm not saying that like Google </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> shreds don't worry okay that's probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why I got the text message because the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guy looked at the security camera I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like this [ __ ] skinny [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna [ __ ] up his social credit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scores </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it must be AI That's counting how many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people are in there next it's pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> easy so it might be AI That's just if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's an automated message yeah but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know it's just like I've never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gotten a message like that and I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like dumb fan I'm like first of all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there was no one there so how the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did they know and second like okay I get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it if there was like you know other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people in the room right that are in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> close vicinity but for one this is an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> empty ass room it was empty the entire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time I was there like before I came </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> after I left no one ever came in no one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even came close also what the [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the point of there being five air </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> purifiers in this tiny room yeah I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like I feel like Japan is like Japan's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like because I know this is with a few </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> places now where Japan's at this point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's kind of like in this limbo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> phase where people don't know yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people don't know whether to take you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know the same Corona precautions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whether to stick with them or not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I've noticed some establishment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you go to like restaurants and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff and all the signs are still up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over like the same like covid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> precautions that would like there deep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> during the pandemic were the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> establishments follow them or not is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> completely a coin flip yeah right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know which thing I I really want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> die and I hope this never I just want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this to stop right it's you only go to a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> restaurant or a cafe yeah and they have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this in Japan I don't think they did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this anywhere else they had the screen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dividing you and your friend yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and so I hate that and so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I to me like again I'm I'm all for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taking precautions to separate you from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other customers because yeah you didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come in with them but if you come in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with say like uh someone you're dating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or your partner who you're married to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and then they put this screen in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between you both in my head I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what is this like I don't understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like I'm visiting my partner in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> jail </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [Applause] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> again I don't if that was like fine but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like if I want to share food it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> becomes impossible oh yeah because you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to go around yeah yeah and don't I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> swear to God if you touch it in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they freak out yeah because you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe you have a big enough table where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like ah [ __ ] it you move it and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> then like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're like what are you doing put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it back and it's like oh what I mean he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just committed Warfare it's weird though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I've been in other restaurants where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll be they'll just literally see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you coming together and they'll just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> move it for you yeah it's so bizarre and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it it feels like incredibly inconsistent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which is what makes it annoying yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and and you know like we did um I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> uh I had my fourth shot recently I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even know if America's doing fourth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shots right or the only is the UK doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fourth shot I have no idea it's covered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> boosters well you know Japan became my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mail and it was like you should do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like fine I'll go do it yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah why not yeah you know who doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> want more protection sure just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> collecting them all right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and so I go and um get this thing I sit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> down and uh this elderly guy starts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talking to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um in Japanese but then he starts he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> asks me if I speak English and I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh yeah I speak English then he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> starts speaking to me in like fluent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> English and he's like he's like 70 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> nearly 80 I think yeah that's like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shiny Pokemon of Japan yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> smooth this most awesome pronunciation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of English ever and I was like oh wow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you start talking and you know you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> having a good time we're like laughing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> joking and then they they're like some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> person came over like stop talking not a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of talk it was maybe you could be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like for covert reasons you could be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spreading it I'm like are we still at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that stage where are we worried about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this like we're wearing masks like is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this apparently we're like whispering to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> each other and then he get this old man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goes yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan is too strict sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm an old Japanese he goes so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> frustrated he was like shaking his head </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when she told him off it was so funny I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was like oh man this guy is like he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the energy of a young person yeah that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> probably why I can speak English right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah he's the voice of reason excuse me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously if an old Japanese guy speaks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> English they've they've traveled around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's up it's it's um it's interesting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean it's weird seeing which aspects </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of covert precautions they cling on to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and I don't necessarily feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's of any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> any real impact more of maybe like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comfort thing yeah I don't really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understand a lot of the thought process </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean it's gotten to the point right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now where I think at this stage in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> pandemic a lot of a lot of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> establishments that do these kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of things it's kind of more like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Theater which is quite sure which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like which is why some people choose to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do it some people would choose not to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enforce it and it's kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dependent on the establishment because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah the I went to a restaurant the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> other day where they still had the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> screen like like uh disconnecting me and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whoever you're sitting down with yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know if you just ask them hey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> can we remove this they were like they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> would just go okay yeah yeah okay okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes they do sometimes they do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes they do not want they are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> absolutely but that's the thing right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it would be less frustrating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if they're at least consistent with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if like if if it was like in the heart </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the pandemic where it's like there is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no [ __ ] there was no excuse It's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this is this this is this and these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are the steps you want to take then it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like okay well there's nothing I can do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about it I might as well live with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but like now as you said it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are sometimes where I walk into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a company right and like one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> company you know I might be like oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I forgot my mask they won't say anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> another one I walk in without my mask </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they just follow the freak the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> out and I'm like can you at least be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> consistent with this [ __ ] yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> went into a combini to buy a mask so I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> lost my mess and then they were freaking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out yeah yeah and I was like oh no no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm buying a mess yeah and they were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like how do we what is this protocol how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> do we ah I can see the like gears </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> turning yeah like oh no because you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> often times yeah your mask yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's like you just put your mess in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> your pocket on it maybe it fell out or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you dropped it somewhere you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> put it in the car you know you've got to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> buy a new mask yeah yeah it's like dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just buying a mask man chill out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like I'm trying to follow and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> adhere to the rules but sometimes it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's it feels like you said it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> feels more like theater and it's in it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well I I think it's it's also compounded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by the fact that you know the country's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> open now and there's no way to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> distinguish us between like people who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have lived here during the pandemic and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tourists you know what I mean so it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of I've because I've noticed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this a lot where before you know people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of treated you all the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um because they knew you know you you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> knew kind of like the rules here because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you must have been living here right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but now they must come in with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Assumption of you just came in this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> country yesterday you don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything you know what I mean and I I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> noticed that subtle like yeah Behavior </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> shift within like the past few weeks oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my God I I recently had something like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that so I I recently did like a collab </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for this like Japanese Channel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> um whereas like they were interviewing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me in Japanese and I went to this like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Studio to go do it and it was run by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Tokyo television or whatever sounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a proper production thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything it was really cool but like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> walk into the studio and and I can see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the set and it's like a like a long kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like semi-circle table with three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seats and I'm in the middle but there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the huge [ __ ] plastic devices yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah right like that that's on on TV or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and I'm like oh okay I mean well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's Japanese TV so it's whatever the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> problem was for one no one in this room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is wearing a mask and second of all I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> walk in and I get introduced to the host </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the co-host and I just like straight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up shake hands with them none of us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wearing a mask and I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so if I can come this close to someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without a mask and touch them and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately sit down and I'm protected </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> by these barriers I'm like I think we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> getting things the other way around like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the way that it in terms of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the way that the thought process is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> behind that is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like you know there's still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> acting shows going on right there's no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dramas yeah um and they're not wearing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> masks show they don't have these plastic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> dividers yeah they're acting as if like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's in like a different world yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think the reason why reality shows and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> current TV shows in Japan that uh very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all based on like real things or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's this kind of way of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> messaging being like hey we are still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> taking this seriously yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which but it's like in a pseudo way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because obviously like dramas and stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> aren't held to that same standard just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because they're like I think it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you don't view it as something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's real yeah yeah exactly but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weird because obviously it's real and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these actors are interacting yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's obviously like people don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> actually care about the precautions it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they just want to make them they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to think that it it's being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> considered because like being next to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone with a plastic divider here in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the same room I don't it doesn't do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anything no it's just all for sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what are you trying to show you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to show that you're trying to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> take kovid like seriously yeah taking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> precautions it's like well yeah you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really you're kind of half-assing yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if you were actually taking precautions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to stop it then you wouldn't do the show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to begin with yeah signal that you you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> are still considering right which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> weird but at that point it's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like an empty attempt you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like Yeah Yeah we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely making sure no one's getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sick by putting these [ __ ] flimsy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pieces of plastic that are definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> not stopping anything it's also like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> prime example of how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan is quite slow to adopt and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get rid of things like they were quite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> slow to adopt all these precautions yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like it did actually take a while </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> while we were here compared to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Western World and then now that they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not no longer necessary or at least not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as necessary we're seeing that it also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is way harder to get rid of something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where people get accustomed to it in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan yeah like people out of just pure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> comfort and having to deal with this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every day are being much more like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reluctant to get rid of it and these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> systems because I don't know if people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> necessarily even like them here I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really understand because a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of people I've spoke to given they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably more foreign leaning like in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> terms of mindset they they don't really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like it but also it's it's odd I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not so much a matter of liking it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or disliking it I think it's just a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> matter of I think I and I don't speak on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> behalf of all Japanese people but I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think the general consensus is is kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of just like well there's nothing we can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do about it like it or dislike it we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have to adhere adhere to it right so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like what can we do we I can say my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> opinion about this it's not going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> change anything yeah I I honestly you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like don't know because even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> pre-pandemic Japan was one of the few </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> countries that really embraced Mars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> culture to begin with you know there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> will be people wearing masks even before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the pandemic existed and it was a normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> thing to see in Japan was it as common </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no but there was already this mindset </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that was ingrained to be like to take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> precautions you know wear a mask and now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like after the pandemic that's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> exasperated that idea to the point where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's become more than just a precaution </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but just become a habit I mean yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan is still you know even before the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pandemic they were still taking like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> influenza shots every year yeah like no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> one outside of Japan takes him oh no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they uh they do in uh America oh really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> flu shots but is it like common place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's like it's I think yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> think they do it every year yeah really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's I think it's other countries like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least in the UK and Australia I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think we do no but in America they get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> flu shots every year really because we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> got we got like a message from our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> company that was like Hey if you want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your flu shot this year you can come get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it oh and I was like what yeah I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> never had a flu no I've never taken it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah what do you mean like I've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fine yeah but apparently in America it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you get it every year oh wow okay I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't know I didn't know that either </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until I was I think I've taken like flu </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shots when I was a kid or something like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably as a kid yes yeah I'm not sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if it's common in the UK um I've never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> heard of like normal healthy and healthy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> adults yeah I thought it was normally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for elderly and then for younger people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's what I thought as well um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but yeah I don't know I mean the reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> why we obviously we spoke about this so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much because it is just genuinely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> interesting and we're living it and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> seeing it change all the lack of change </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah the gym stuff is annoying yeah I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> really wish yeah because they they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> already I don't know about your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> treadmills in your gym but they've like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> constructed these like plastic like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boxes like they're like covers around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the entire treadmill oh like a yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a it's like something you'd see out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like a like a like an infection movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a pod it's literally like they've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> built like a plastic pod from shower </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> poles and plastic what the [ __ ] no our </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one is literally just the one it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally flimsy plastic it's my dream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is literally that and then they make you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> wear a mask in it and to be fair like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> said most people I've seen half mess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> skin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they're not doing it uh and I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never seen anyone get told off for it in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my previous gym this is given this was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like height of the pandemic because you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know sometimes bro you're [ __ ] dying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on that tread oh yeah and you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Brian to gasp for air yeah you pull the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing down one time I was on it going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ham this must have been like 20 20. dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like tapped me on the back and was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dude mask put it up and I was like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> okay sorry and I was like man that sucks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like I can't keep running man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like when you breathe in deeply </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the [ __ ] cloth yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's like I you know I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's people who are like dude you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't breathe in this thing that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] you can but when you're running </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right I there is definitely an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> argument there yeah when you're trying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to get that amount of airflow I mean I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think one of the biggest reasons I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> stopped going to the gym when was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because it just wasn't enjoyable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so it's just like especially me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing cardio with my asthma as well I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like it's just it just stop being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like you stop feeling like I was making </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> progress and you just felt like I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tortured torturing myself and I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a big reason why I just stopped going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I was like I'll go in The Mask </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mandate is lifted for the gym and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just if it will ever at this point never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> did so I was like it's weird that it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of kept on in the gym yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've genuinely thought the gym would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the first places that they would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> stop doing it because like in Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> schools and stuff right when they do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exercise they don't have to wear masks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah so I kind of thought oh okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well that's that's like a government </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of and again that's why it's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> annoying it's like be consistent with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this [ __ ] yeah it's like if you're doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> physical exercise whether it's in a gym </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whether it's in a schoolyard whether </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's [ __ ] out on the street you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just running along the sidewalk it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> either mask on for everyone or mask on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for no one yeah that's right I think you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know it's been kind of frustrating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because at least in other countries us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the UK it was kind of like on or off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like yeah we're telling you to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wear masks yeah or you don't wear masks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're in Japan it's kind of like here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you do here you don't don't do it here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to wait for a moment here like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole dance of like in Japan let's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say you're walking outside yeah and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know you don't have to wear a mask </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> outside and then you can go inside say a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> restaurant if you put your mask on for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like 10 seconds and then you sit down as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're walking down the moon you sit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> down you're allowed to take your mask </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> off yeah and then it's like okay what is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because we all know once you sit down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> covert's like oh wait yeah I'll wait </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> till you finish your meal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I don't know I don't get it again I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think any of us are trying to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> come off as like complaining about like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I think I'm I'm happy to comply and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wear a mask wherever is happy to help </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and stop spread of it as long as rules </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> are consistent yeah you just have some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> goddamn consistency and make some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] sense yeah and let me run </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without a mask yeah exactly that's why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been trying to like cycle more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I'm just like dude I'm so done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being like doing exercise inside you've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> leveled up you've gone from like indoor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exercise to like now outdoor exercise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right but the one thing that's better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about indoor exercising it's way more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> convenient yeah it's easier to keep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> track of let's say you know if you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cycling you can't even like make a route </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that comes back to your house yeah or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wherever you are right it's kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the Gym's easy you rock up run the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> treadmill lift the rock well that's why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just do weights at the gym now like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm doing just like cardio stuff I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have a [ __ ] indoor bike that in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> house so I just I'm on that yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we all did our health checkup recently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't we I haven't done it yet you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> haven't done it I I missed myself </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> like no if anything like I don't know </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> just get the cash and I just buy what I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want you know so it's whatever but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I but if I do that for other people then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it pisses them off so I'm just like well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] what am I supposed to do because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm so bad at buying gifts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> awful buying gifts but I realize I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> also awful at buying gifts for myself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for myself yeah and I'm I'm like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> number one culprit of like when someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> asks me what do I want I'm like I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] know the problem with me as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that like because I either just want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know the things that I want the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> short list of things that I want in my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> head for like the immediate future or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the far future is always like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two extremes right so it's like when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hockey's like oh what do you want for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like as a gift you know what do you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want me to give you and I'm like ah I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> debating between a house and a chocolate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like there's nothing in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> between that I want it's like if I have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a house that'd be great yeah well get me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a moss block I kind of I'm craving a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> moss bar right now it's like well you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> know I know exactly what you mean like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everything you want is not like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Christmas gift it's not it's not in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> budget yes it's not it's either too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> cheap or way too like or like a life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] goal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what is that like the perfect price of a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Christmas gift in your mind it depends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on who you're giving it to yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because like I kind of tear it out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in my hair yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no I tear it out I'm like if it's family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> members then okay you know the budget </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can be I don't know anywhere between 50 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to 200 right like depending on what it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is if it's like a mate right that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you might see every now and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then like then you know you can usually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> get some pretty good gifts between like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 20 25 dollars right yeah so that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what I kind of aim it to do but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then there's that mental game right of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like all right I'm getting my friend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something that's like around 25 what if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they give me something that's way more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> expensive it's the game of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Christmas chicken right it's it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't want to be that guy who just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gets like a really cheap gift and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mate gets like a really expensive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly but also you don't want to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that mate who's a bit overbearing and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was just like well got a gift that's way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> too overly expensive you're right you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know what I mean yeah it's tough I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in my mind is like let's say I got you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an 80 gift I got you a 200 gift yeah I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't view it as okay I value God more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so yeah maybe I found a gift that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was perfect for Joey that was 80 bucks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right that sucks that I found the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> perfect gift for Grant there was more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> than I wanted to spend yeah but I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think God would ever buy it for himself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think this is a great gift so then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like okay in my head these two are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like both the perfect gift but obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the price is different yeah yeah so that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's how I kind of look at it yeah but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's tough it is tough because then you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't want they might not view it that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way yeah and especially like if you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the receiving end of that as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like oh you know oh my friend could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be like oh I got you this perfect gift </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a 200 wine decanter or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> something yeah oh I got you a tender </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> it's all good when it seems like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't put nearly as much effort as they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do oh yeah not necessarily monetarily </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like they're like oh yeah I put way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> less thought into mine yeah and you put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> way too much thought into yours the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> thing it's like oh the thing is there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been points where I I have received like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> expensive gifts right but it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> price isn't always the thing that's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most valuable when it comes to like gift </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> giving if there's a gift that's perfect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for someone like it could be cheaper it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> could be more expensive I've like showed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out for like a gift that's more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> expensive when I think a mate would like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or make a family yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we'd really really enjoy this and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything like that yeah um but also </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> like a lot of thought into yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and I feel like there's that's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> real kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's the real trickiness of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like gift giving okay here's a question </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to ask then do you guys like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> kid whether it's like birthday or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Christmas or anything like that any kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of Celebration I want to know what I'm </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> no I hate it I hate it yeah right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sorry you hate not knowing what you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna get yeah not knowing what I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna I hate receiving surprise gifts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it makes me feel okay if there's one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing that I hate even though even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> though I know it's even though I know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most people don't think like this right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah this is just a me problem I just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hate feeling like I'm indebted okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like even if they expected nothing from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Return they were just giving it to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of the kindness of my heart and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know it and I know that and I know the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> surprise gift but what occasion okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even even if it's like no occasion right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's like you know uh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> friend just came back from somewhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're not expecting any kind of gift </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they're like hey I got you something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like it's cool receiving it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm like oh [ __ ] they care for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me yeah but now I feel bad because now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm indebted and I feel like I need to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> return the favor it is so nice if they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> would be like yeah someone is giving </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their surprise gift they're not the type </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of person who would then expect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> something bad no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> would you want the solution then to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them not give you a gift what is the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> solution to this problem the solution </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would be for me to like reprogram my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brain to not okay such a [ __ ] idiot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so what do you prefer having this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> anxiety of debt or not receiving the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gift but like uh which one's more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> powerful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see that's the tough part right and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why I think my solution </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> personally is for me to be the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to give special gifts no no that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's my my solution yeah my solution </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I give people gifts before me I will </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> never feel indebted that is my solution </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's it's I mean I've had this Howie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this much of the same answer I've had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this before because I know Malin feels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same way and every time I give </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maiden a gift she has the exact same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> look in her eyes as I do when I receive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the gift yeah I know I'm like it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> an Asian thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> even if it was something that say like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they hand made it because I've received </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like handmade gifts from like my friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before right of like some cool [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like and and you know there's no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> monetary value to that because it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something they bought right it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something they've made right so I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's more so just the fact that they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> went through the effort to think about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> me and to get something that they think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I would like yeah that makes me feel bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no it's it's not it's not even it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even does that make sense to me it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> even like anything to do with like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> monetary value or anything like that it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> could be like a one dollar thing I'd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> still feel bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if for me like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you need to borrow like five pounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five dollars off of me yeah does do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you remember that [ __ ] and you were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I am going to pay this back one day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or can it sometimes like oh absolutely I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I make a like a subconscious thing of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like okay uh you know next time you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> paying I'll be like oh yeah by the way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you owe me five bucks but I'll be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like just whatever figure it out I keep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a very rough balance in my head of who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who's oh is what no if I if I borrow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> money off anyone I like write that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down on my phone I'm like I owe this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> person this much money yeah it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like I'm a [ __ ] Lannister the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> debt is being paid no no shame whether </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they like it or not I find that people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> are way more forgetful when it's like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hey I'll get you a coffee and then you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> don't think like oh he spent five bucks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like he got me a coffee and then it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very easy to forget that someone got you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a coffee even though that's the exact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same monetary value Plus work of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bringing it to you yeah yeah so like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that that's harder to keep track of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah then that's normally how what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you you have like the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um the very casual balance sheet between </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you and your friend that's in your head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like okay he bought me five coffees </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I am three drinks or something you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah so you kind of like pay it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back right that's how I'm more so like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because when do I actually need to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> borrow cash I don't it's like can you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> get this drink yeah yeah yeah that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more so what my life comes down when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have you when's the last time you ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> asked for cash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean like a very long time I did like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a week ago yeah but I paid it back like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immediately yeah yeah but that that's me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as well when that's like 500 bucks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not it's not it's not quite though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> can you you've got a spare tennis I have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the same energy of like can I have the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 500 bucks and I'll give it you back oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> my God it sounds like a car was because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I forgot to get ATM out of the crane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> game all right okay 500 bucks for crane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> games right now yeah I'll pay you back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> later I don't know where this came from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't matter if it's like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> surprise gift or even if it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a casual favor or something if I if I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like oh someone a favor they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that that that keeps me up at night </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm just like when I'm when is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this when am I gonna feel like okay I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 100 comes down to uh viewer money though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm pretty sure and how you how you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> valued because you know time equals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> money yes we I think you don't want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> someone's time energy or like kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> money and how you viewed it and how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've been brought up viewing it I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think it definitely ties into that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you look back at how you were taught </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about money it's probably the same kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of mindset as like um now with the gift </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> giving of like right if somebody gives </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you something you give it back yes you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know if somebody I mean that is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> super ingrained into Japanese yeah okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think it's money I just what was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that was that of a distilled into you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where money if someone lends you money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or you work you have to work for your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> money you have to do like I think all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comes down to that where you put a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> certain value on time and money in your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> head because you're because you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> raised to and you value that and so I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think that that carries on in in odd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> ways and odd course I think that's right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no I I I I I don't think so because to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> me I'm I'm like trying to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> psychoanalyze myself right now I never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not valuing our friendship or our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> relationship as much as they value I I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never want them to feel like I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> value our friendship or our relationship </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> as much as I do so whenever someone goes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of their way to do something nice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for me I'm like that that's I you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm [ __ ] touch because I'm like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah but then I guess that that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> means you're then you're saying that the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> value of the friendship or what value </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you bring to it is is you can Define it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with objects or monetary like value just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> saying if you give me a gift and I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give you one back I didn't value the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> friendship as much as you whereas I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> disagree because a lot of people can get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way more fulfilling things out of a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> friendship like you might have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's say you know you've helped me out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way more than you realize and then I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give you a gift in my head that's not me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saying hey now you owe me one it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> no no I know that a lot yeah but that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what I'm saying like that means you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> viewing it the way you're subconsciously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> looking at it is like okay there is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> has value and this is how the Friendship </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> works I think I think I think is tied to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole there might be a little bit of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that but I think in my head there's more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so the matter of like I would rather you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spend that money and time on yourself or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> other people other than me yeah because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys said you feel bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel bad because I in my head I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that could be a gift or a money span or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time spent finding that gift or whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or time spent making the money to buy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that gift that you could use on yourself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or other people in your life sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> appreciation yeah yeah and that's why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's why like that's that's what I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean by I feel bad because it's like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> already for the most time I already </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> value the relationship that I have with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this person just them being a maiden </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you know [ __ ] with me right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know like you know them like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know [ __ ] vibing with me right it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like just the fact that you're my friend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like more than enough for me right so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like I would rather as a friend I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would rather you I mean I appreciate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting the gift no matter how much it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> costs right no matter how quick or long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it took to get that gift but in my head </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like I already appreciate you enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as a friend and as a friend I would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rather see you use that time and money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on other people than me yeah because I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't need it so you know for the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> part yeah yeah I agree with that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so going back to like I think a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone has a different thing that they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really put a lot of weight on you know I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think that like as I've got older uh and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had to balance more friendships and seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how they work in more adult situations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like okay some people when they like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really appreciate a friendship they'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go out there they make gifts some people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> will go out of their way to arrange a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really cool hangout and they'll do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything right yeah some people really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> value maybe how quickly you text back or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how quickly you stay in touch right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like everyone has like value that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they assign to certain things yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just about being an adult is trying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to figure out hey this friend he really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> likes it when I reply to text quickly or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this friend really appreciates it when I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give them a gift that you know they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't think about or this friend really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> appreciates it when I take them out for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a good time and so I think it's it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like you're probably in a different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> category where you value something else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more in a friendship than a gift yes and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to you a gift seems like oh [ __ ] I gotta </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to give this back to show that I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> appreciate you where it's like no I can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would normally show it in my own way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which might be I'll hang out with you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and chat with you for hours and yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're the first person I want to go to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for this type of topology you know what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean yeah it's weird it's it's cheesy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's like to me it's like your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> presence is a gift me too me right it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's like just the fact that you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there and you're my friend I agree more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than anything it's it's cheesy but I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> feel the exact same way when I'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] I've just just just being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> around me is enough of them that you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my friend is like all that I could ask </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for I'm sure you've probably met that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> type of person who's always buying gifts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> even though like they're broke yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like that's just like I think that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like a personality trait where yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they really value being able to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> physically show that they they enjoy the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> friendship or whatever it is yeah that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> how in their head it's like fulfilling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to kind of give back like physically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with like an item by the way is there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any friends of ours watching this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I say if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you give I'm not gonna be like get the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] out of here right like I'll take it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll take it okay just know that you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't have to here's the thing no no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we're all pretty we all do pretty pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> good money-wise yes it becomes way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] harder to buy gifts to people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who can buy things yes this has been a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> me issue no matter what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I said let's say I have all the money in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the world how do I buy you a gift card </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when I know if you want something you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just gonna buy it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause you can afford it but that's why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why I I'm not going up to to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] stupid money yeah I'm not going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to do that but that's why again I value </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just like you being there and when I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> need you or you know when you want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hang out and stuff like that I I value </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that kind of relationship in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> friendship so much more than I ever have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in my life yeah like okay I think I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think this goes back to like another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing as well I don't know if this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like Anyway related right but I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one thing I've always just not hated but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just felt a little bit uncomfortable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with was kind of like being the center </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of attention and I I I don't know it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> podcast I don't know how ironic this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how ironic this is you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about 130 episodes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I still had a bunch of shows but I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] hate being the center of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> attention I don't know because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a very clear distinction between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a center of attention when performing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and the center of attention in your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> personal life yes and to me right I love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being the center of attention when I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I'm I'm performing or doing stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure we all do yeah well it's ego </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> stroke very nice yeah personal life it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like all right sometimes yeah sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no yeah I sometimes like it sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like no yeah yeah but like for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> example for example what I mean for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> example like birthday parties right like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> do do you like having a birthday party </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for your birthday specifically set up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right all right for you I got an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> opinion right right you know what I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean no I think the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> birthday party the entire Vibe is up to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whoever's organizing it or you yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can make a birthday party feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a normal party just with the excuse that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's my birthday yeah you know and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's how I like it where it's like hey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's all get together it's just an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> excuse to get everyone in the same room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I'm not about to be like hey guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's toast to me tell me what you love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about me show me your presence there are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people like that but I don't know and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's where I'm like bro come on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I I love that Vibe like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> birthday party Vibe where it's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> any excuse for everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> together everyone you come out in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> same room and just hang out but I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> also had birthday parties and been to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> birthday parties where it's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guys it's this guy's birthday guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so this guy's and I just I I hate that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feeling having a day that is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> centered around you basically I just I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just I it was I think it's selfish it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was something that just never I never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> felt comfortable with you know what I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mean you see it's selfish and I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a lot of people argue being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well it's the one day of the year you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can be selfish no right so you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's having a birthday 24 7. you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know what I mean you're not special </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah you can have a day why are you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna make the day about you all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you can it can be your day without </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me without putting down everyone else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah before someone turns out to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> your party they're probably doing chores </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing laundry they don't give fact that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's your birthday you know what I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like everyone's just you know hey I'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> especially as an adult I just think that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like you it can be your day without </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> making it like everyone you forcing on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone else that it's your day yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah I agree I think you can have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> nice day have the perfect day you want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but you know just just let that see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like that's what I that's what I really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> appreciated about my birthday this year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right because like it was while we're on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tour and we were doing a show in Ohio </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of all days and uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like and to me that was like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> perfect scenario for like a birthday </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> party right because it was like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't like the entire show was about oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's Joey's birthday today [ __ ] it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like just a thing that was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tacked on at the end I didn't even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] know about it I got a python in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my face yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my opinion that was like the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> birthday party yeah because it's like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't the center of attention I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just like a little tack on thing where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like by the way yeah it's Joey's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> butt yeah you know because the re the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reason I bring that up is you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having a day centered around you gives </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> me the same kind of feeling of just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting a surprise gift or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's just like I I'm getting now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the eyes are on you yeah yeah I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm getting attention from like people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around me and everything like that and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like I I was just comfortable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just chilling and just just hanging out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and not saying it's exactly the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing like I'm trying to like trying to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like understand why but I'm just saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of gives me like the same feeling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of just like oh I didn't expect this um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not that I'm ungrateful about it it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just I don't know how to handle it or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> deal with it and that's completely just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a me thing it's it's a complete judgment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like that as well yes I was gonna say I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was like because it feels like weirdly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's very easy to be like hey I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on camera all day I got so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> attention I'm like this time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna have some attention today </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meanwhile I post 15 Vlogs and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] stream for six seconds you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what I mean like I feel like it's a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ironic for me to be like no I'm good I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like you know I think I get enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in my mind is probably it is pretty stem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from I get enough attention I'm chill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with that yeah yeah but I wonder if I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't do this would I want more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> attention I think yeah no I've been kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the same as like not not ever since I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was a kid or anything because I feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's not up until a certain age </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you become self-aware about that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of [ __ ] where you start you realize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being like Oh okay maybe I don't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the attention for my like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like when you're [ __ ] the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> inverse yeah well like when you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] five years old right like you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not gonna be like guys play pins on me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not I'm not the host or anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just go have fun like you know of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know like you don't have that kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of self-awareness but like it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until I feel like you're around I want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to say like 13 14 like when you enter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like high school or middle school where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you start to realize you either turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> into the kid that wants to be the center </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of attention or you turn into the kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that doesn't yeah man I had this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> fantastic English teacher okay I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just right she was like the best English </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> teacher man was she angry though like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like you know when some I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you ever had these teachers then they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were super angry but not because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were just life wasn't going their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way they were [ __ ] angry because you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weren't listening and they were very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> passionate about it right right she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> cared so much about English and teaching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it yeah and it was like she was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> terrifying she was by far the scariest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> teacher like all the like everyone was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scared of her and she used to go off and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I for some reason you always stuck with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me it was like if a kid was like making </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> noise and [ __ ] she would just tear into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them in front of the whole class and be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> oh Charlie is it because you don't have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enough attention at home that you want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to try and get some attention in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> classroom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> she would just destroy them go into them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's all with these kids I'm like 12. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh [ __ ] hell that's something when a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> kid traumatized kid would just like do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some [ __ ] she'd be she would always just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rinse how they wanted attention they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weren't getting it at home so it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh so you're not getting enough at home </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you decide to ruin my classroom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to get attention then your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pathetic life or something like that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go off dude excuse me holy [ __ ] she's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> awesome she was so good at teaching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> English yeah it's very fun okay no I get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it now I okay yeah I'm I'm proud of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> code so the point was that yeah they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> stuck with me and the kids want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> attention and that you realize you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want attention to what you do and what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're doing yeah okay that's why I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brought that out right what what up what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gives me happiness </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> God is justlyn right now he's like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> figured out yeah I've I've just I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just been it's like Will Smith I'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like why I've just been trying to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] psychoanalyze my mind to be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why am I so why am I such a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> idiot why am I so [ __ ] difficult with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the simplest of things right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um yeah for me like what actually gives </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me happiness is making the people around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> me happy seeing the people around me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happy so when protagonists so so when so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when the goal is to make me happy and to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like when people are like actively </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to make me happy by just doing a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nice thing or something that just feels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weird to me because my happiness comes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from just seeing people around me happy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah that is the most harm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> protagonists </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> happiness comes from giving you a gift </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the Paradox I'm stuck in right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> now Connor I don't know how to escape </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by being upset about receiving the gift </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you're making them upsets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel bad you feel better no I feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> pressured you feel pressured yeah maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you gotta make them upset yeah maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> actually it's it's and again that's why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a mean problem it's it's literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like like I said I'm not upset it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like you just break me where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just putting me into like a logic Loop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right I'm just like I don't know what to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel I know I should feel free and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like and then like I get blue screens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's me with social interaction like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I don't know it's it's I always try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and like psychoanalyze and try and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> figure out why the [ __ ] I like think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> certain ways or do certain things I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah what what made me think this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way because yeah you hear what other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> people think and I'm like oh why do I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not why do I not yeah why do I not think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that way yeah why do I not why like why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is it where that I differed in terms of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that yeah trying to figure it out and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's normally always something I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to I'm trying to think if there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like a weird birthday party in my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> childhood that just traumatized me and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to have like my own birthday but did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guys ever have like your own like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> special birthday parties as a kid I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know if that's like a thing right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I'm just trying to think it might </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe the way I thought about it is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like I used to have a childhood friend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> who had a birthday two days before mine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right and so a lot of birthday parties </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> were joint books I remember this yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so that might maybe be like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> subconscious reason I don't want to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the center of attention this was in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> age where like you don't get to choose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who's coming to the birthday party yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone invites everywhere yeah I have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like really weird memories like very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> vague though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I [ __ ] know why it's because my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> birthday is like end of May which is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> deep during exam season no matter what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> before that before what about before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that yeah before example like when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're in like elementary school because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> my birthday was in summer so I never got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to spend it anyone I was like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so I just got I just got used to never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> having a birthday party for a lot of my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I say teenage years especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah I didn't have any you didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I had like really tiny ones with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like the close friends because when it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in school you can do like much bigger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> ones yeah because like you I yeah I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would go to like people's birthday party </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like everyone would be there and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just got used to like oh okay you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wanted to have like a birthday party or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something well sorry revising for exams </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or sorry way on holiday or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that I'm just trying to think I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally can't remember a single </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> birthday party between the age of 10 and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 18. I'm trying to remember because I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember those birthday parties I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> remember are the most extravagant and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen yeah I think sausage rolls </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that they felt like the most extravagant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I've always like sausage rolls </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and crisps and then like some like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sandwich to just like dig in did you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> ever like did you ever like ever have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a birthday party where you went to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like a [ __ ] McDonald's or like some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the McDonald's flavor yo that was the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hell yeah there was no playpen really we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> had to play pen like 10 minutes drive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> from my house and that was like where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd say up until maybe the age of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> six or seven was like just just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> McDonald's playpen party and then a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> genius branding of them I think after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I [ __ ] love McDonald's from age </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] City yeah and then literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah the other birthday party that I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> remember really vividly was uh I went to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I I think it was like seven or eight it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like right after the playpen era um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the playpen Arc of my birthdays it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh my dad organized a day where we went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go see the premiere of Finding Nemo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's hope yeah and so my dad would make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these like invitation cards right and he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would send them off to like the parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like and being like you have been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> invited this is the exclusive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey's eighth birthday premiere of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> red carpet of finding [ __ ] Nemo and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then literally just after that it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just a blank period of I don't remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what my birthday buddy and then when I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was my 18th birthday party I just got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stupidly wasted I mean actually you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what I think about it I can barely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> remember anything from my childhood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a problem that's a different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> problem that's straight up I'm thinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about it now I can I can scarcely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember I I have bits and pieces well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you remember you're a member of like all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the I think everything you've talked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about you're concerning your childhood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> has all been on trash days right like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like a lot of core memories like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> beating the French kid yeah that's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> very cool memory yeah I have a bunch of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other scattered memories but I couldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> tell you what that's well that's that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why trash days is such a weird entity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because most of the time I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> remember this [ __ ] and then we're having </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this random ass conversation and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they're just like [ __ ] like I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> get a flashback yeah some birthday </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> parties I just started getting like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> flashbacks too and I was like oh yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> remember one of the hypest things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um you know I mean I might think about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my parents weren't like broke or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything but my mama just didn't believe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in spending money on certain things yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um I'll put it that way I'm almost gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kill me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um so like if we ever went to the cinema </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like no you're not allowed to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> any of the snacks or anything like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh [ __ ] no not at all right just get to </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> is fair enough I think that's yeah you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> know if I want to get that yeah but I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember when Goblet of Fire came out I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got to go and so on my friends birthday </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> obviously when I was a kid I would have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to go with them all right I would go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the I would go to my parents friend's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> house and I just remember like the my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> biggest thing was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was the one place I didn't want to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I was like why you take me away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> from my [ __ ] games to make me sit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> down and drink tea and go to this house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever and just sit here and do the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people I don't know don't talk to people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know you know yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> horrible but did I remember do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember like how easy it was to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> entertain yourself when you were a kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah I don't know a lot of memories </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of being bored I'm trying to remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I all I can remember is being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bored but then I think about it and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look at Kids now and I'm just like man I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] I [ __ ] miss being a kid where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like just so easy to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> entertain yourself and I tried to think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back I think I'm not entertained tonight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> kids have it easy now yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that because of all the technology they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have access to right like we had what a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Game Boy Advance maybe if you were lucky </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if your parents love you enough so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there'd be some things where my parents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> wouldn't let me take the Game Boy and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they wanted me to like kind of interact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah yeah yeah and I would be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> why okay okay okay okay question </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> question how do you guys feel about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hawks just like city parks like he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't like Park like in general yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just just like as as in as a place to go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to you know waste an afternoon or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> something like that well for as an adult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as an adult and a kid well as an adult I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think it's fine every now and then you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know across yeah especially in Tokyo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because you [ __ ] need it yeah because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't see grass otherwise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> London has so much [ __ ] parks and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like lovely scenery and like Tokyo is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like how about one park but you have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pay to get in yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or your yogi park where everyone on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Earth in Japan goes to and it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah this is [ __ ] yeah yeah I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like because I've I've been waiting to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have a hot take on Parks I just saw I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I don't know if it's just parks in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan or or anything like that I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't like them like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I just like for me like for me wait wait </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> did you like parks in the UK </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not really why not what'd you do in them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's walk it's not like a cinema it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> not like there's something to just walk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you enjoy it you got to make your own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like permanently online </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what do you mean what do you do you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> go to the park you chill out you walk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you breathe in do you like walking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> walking's fine but I can walk anywhere </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> can't the type of [ __ ] walk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> outside being like what's the quest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for Parks right my favorite parks for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> example is if there's like an activity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to do at the park like maybe like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> playground or something oh you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe I would can't like on a playground </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> no no I don't know because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the reason I bring this up and it's this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is why I'm like married to cities </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we have exactly the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> opinions we we we started like walking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around which we explore like we explore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like part of our neighborhood and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a park that we've never been to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and we're like oh maybe we should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> explore the park that's what that's what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people do on this case right that's what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> humans act like right on on days we uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like humans do this thing called </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Walking In the Park yeah yeah yeah so we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> try it out so we go in the spark and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have to pay to get in this park so we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like okay it must be a pretty big park </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah which one uh I don't remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the park name it's it's near to where I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> live so I don't really want to doctor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> myself yeah um but clearly he doesn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> care there's not a lot of parks in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> trouble you have to pay yeah under the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> big ones yeah uh so we pay you to get in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we've paid to get Parts before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally what we like to do is we like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to cycle around the park there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally a lot it's normally big enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to have like us like a bike rental and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we just cycle around that to me is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan yeah in Japan is there I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> know there isn't anywhere near where I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> live I remember I remember there was one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty famous one that's massive thank </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not sure if it's in Tokyo or saitama </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll have to double check it but it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> not it's definitely not in like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> center Center yeah you know that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the kind of Park experience I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> liked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um sure maybe I just say walking right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because me and Sydney it sounds like you </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> direction for like it doesn't even have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be long 10 15 minutes and that just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> refreshes your mind it's so nice no I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I get that because like to me so it so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> why don't you just do that but do it in </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> what are you hoping what did you expect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the park to be I don't know it just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> feels it just it's always felt weird for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> me you know having to go to a place to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel happy okay I I I love I love like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the feeling you guys are talking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but like yeah so to me like that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> spontaneous you know that's that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> spontaneous I love for example so you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> asking why people go to the park on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> routine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yes it's is it for like is it for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> environment there's a lot of studies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> been done but like just being around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like nature or seeing a lot of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> green nature yeah uh is just generally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quite healthy and it's a kind of a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so many studies on it but and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> again I don't know any of the top of my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> head but it's very relaxing it's good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for you yeah uh and you should do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's why I I used to love in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Australia I used to love going on like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bushwalks yeah like you know just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> through the rainbow it's relaxing I love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that because like it's like it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> exciting and every direction you look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just trees but it's nice I do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> um not semi-regularly like every few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weeks I go to the park just walk yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like coffee because for me I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think what's always like weird not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weirded me out but one one thing that I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never like got Parks like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> personally is just because it always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> felt like so artificial you know in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> terms of like I love the feeling of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> waking up and just exploring nature and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything like that and that's why I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really value it on like trips where we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to somewhere where it is an actual </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know beautiful place yes where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just can wake up go to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> countryside and you just get that kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of feeling Parkers have always been like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I go there and I never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ever I never ever get that feeling of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the same Tranquility it's just like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is if I walk for like 10 15 minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna reach the end and go back to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> City I mean it's just like obviously in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like parks and mainly for cities right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's just so much concrete yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> drab gray yeah it's to I mean it is you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know it's gonna make you feel more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> livable that's why like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan had figured out they were like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wait we should probably should have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> built more trees in our cities because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the newer parts of Tokyo all have trees </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yes everywhere yeah because you realize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like subconsciously in your brain you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh this is so much nicer because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's nature with the concrete yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know it does something in your brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where you just feel like oh this is more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> pleasant yeah that's why I in my opinion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> some of the best cities I've been to are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the ones that are built around the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nature or it's built within the nature </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not so much like Tokyo where it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's just take all the nature away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> replace with buildings yes and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe every now and every [ __ ] 10 20 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> meters we'll plan one skinny ass I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the most parks to City ratio I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I could be wrong why don't you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could check that Kai yeah and I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this comes back to when I was a kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I I always it always weirded me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out as a kid where it was just like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> concept of just plopping in Greenery in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a concrete jungle and I mean I get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it now as an adult to be like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you need a change of environment or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something like that yeah but I just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me as a kid it was I I never I never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> went to a park for that if I was going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to a park I was playing footy or I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to the playground activity and as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an adult I still mentally like I link up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I link parks to like the same kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mental barrier where it needs to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going there for a singular activity I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mean there's nothing wrong with this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with in your age to want to go to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> park to play footy with your mates oh no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but also yeah it's important for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cities to have communal spaces yes right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in Tokyo where the [ __ ] can you go yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like an open space </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like nothing nothing you have to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> outside it's like yeah Tokyo is like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know you can't do anything you have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go towards like [ __ ] uh mitaka like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you know it's it's good to have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> options yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you're probably walking on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> touristy spots and the biggest one is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hyde Park obviously that's very touristy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but you know even where like yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean I lived in London London parks are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like [ __ ] massive to the point to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> point where you forget that it's a park </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right right I think that's also played </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into the fact that there are a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like small parks in Tokyo as well yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's just I'm just like this ain't a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> park this is a patch of grass because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there's some trees in it you know we'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> have oh this is the park there's two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> football pitches a pond and a bunch of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> other [ __ ] yeah yeah enough space for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you to do whatever you want like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's valued a lot more I think in oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely Europe than so well not that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it was valued a lot more I think it just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't in the city planning when Tokyo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was being developed like it was not all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about developing space for commercial </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> use yeah yeah and they were like oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just trying to build as much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> infrastructure in a small amount of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> space as possible right yeah yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then obviously now we figured out out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that hey if you build a city with more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> trees and more green that people are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> happier yeah like I think it is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there is a correlation between how happy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh absolutely and how yeah yeah how much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh nature there is there or accessible I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> guess in Tokyo it's like everyone's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to just leave Tokyo well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's such a [ __ ] that's why like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could never live in like Central Tokyo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's why I don't live in central </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Tokyo because it's like every time I go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to Central Tokyo I'm like this is drab </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as [ __ ] like there's no Greenery like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and again as someone who grew up next to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a [ __ ] National Park if I don't see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even a little bit of greenery I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Panic oh you've seen Wales [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing yeah exactly Fields I like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's it yeah that's what you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what you want yeah even living in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Brighton I would love to take drives </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like down to like the South Downs and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything like that you know just just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get like I don't know to to me that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what an escape is you know I it to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a commitment to get into like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a proper environment to reset myself and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I really really like that so so if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Sydney don't like Parks what do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do sorry so if you you and Sydney don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Parks or like don't like walking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through Parks what is like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> equivalent that you guys do I know we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just have light in nature yeah so how do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we see nature yeah how do you experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it I mean normally we just through my 4K </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> TV I mean normally we just take like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> weekend trip outside of Tokyo or if we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have a date that we normally have an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> activity we're doing on that date the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> activity isn't going to a park the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> activity if we go to a park the activity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is going to a park to do X or to do y or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to cycle around if that makes sense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right to me like it's it's gonna sound </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weird but just walking to me I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really count that as an activity it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just a thing that I do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if I'm walking I need a destination to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> walk to I can't get that I can't just be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> walking for the sake of walking no I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know if that makes any sense I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like walking for the second walking I I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> get uh I get gone in that sense like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> also like I'm I'm stuck I'm slowly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> starting to get better at it because Aki </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is definitely the type of person who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just wants to like walk with no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> destination yeah and I'm like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's fun when I do it with you but not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'm by myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then I'm just like well [ __ ] I'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasting time at this point like I would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> be doing something else at this time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though I know in my head this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good for me yeah right and it's and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a good escape from all the other [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm doing but I think again I'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like perpetually just bound to my work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in that sense where I'm trying to escape </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and yet in my head I'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> free emails right now yeah I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I know sometimes it's about the journey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not the destination but always about the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> journey it is always about the Journey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the destination but sometimes I need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that destination to make me appreciate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the journey just just to just so I can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have that mental that mental thing of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just okay I know where I'm going and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then I could just you know zone out and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just appreciate the journey I appreciate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that a lot of people are just like I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just going to do whatever and uh we'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> find out what the destination is along </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the way uh I cannot do that [ __ ] [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give me a destination give give me an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> end point give me a goal to work towards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if it's just like the most Bare </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Bones like simple goal yeah and that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> would just like allow me to like just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just tell me I need to like go to a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] Family Market yeah it's better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's better I know there's one around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the corner but I'm like you know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll skip that one go to the next one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah to make the journey worth it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> even that is fine look you can you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put me here and the destination here and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go this [ __ ] route and I'll be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay let's go that route but if you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you just tell me oh let's just go up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here and just see where we go I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no give me a destiny just tell me where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we go tell me where we're ending up is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it a family more is it are we going for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the are we going for the family chicken </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just just let me know I don't know yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean I guess it's strange I guess I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't really mind because in my head I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh I should a form of light </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exercise yeah right so I'm like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's fine then um you know I'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like if in my head if it's exercise I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh yeah cool no no and like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know I see it that way as well but again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like I I'm more determined to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through that exercise if I knew where I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was going yeah and it's like and it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could be like super [ __ ] fast super </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> short it doesn't matter just the fact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I have a goal to reach makes me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> work for the goal and it makes it worth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> working towards the goal yeah I think I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also just I think the reason why I like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> IRL streaming as well is that I can kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of pseudo exercise while doing it just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> walking around all the time yeah did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just content machine you know I want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> make content I want to min max </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> everything yeah I just like the fact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that I can just do create content and be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some somewhat active at the same time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah it's kind of nice for sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like oh okay I don't feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like such a slob and I can go home and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> relax and I feel like oh that was not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bad I was good yeah but then when you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> get home and you're like [ __ ] I have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> make contact although I normally drink </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I do IRL so I cancel any better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because like talking about you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> touching grass and we're going going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like adventures and everything like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I get Slice of Life anime now </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] I mean a lot of people do like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but not even explain why I'll explain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll explain because for for the longest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time I didn't really like I didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really like understand the appeal of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like watching a lot of Slice of Life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime like especially like and stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> we explore it's like it's really really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> quiet area we explore the area and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something and most of the most the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we just just do nothing we just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chill and just take in the atmosphere </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there's not much to do in yet yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's nothing to do no there's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> much to do I haven't seen you can drink </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wine that's it yeah that's all you drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> wine and watch my mouth Fuji that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah you you can drink wine and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just take in the atmosphere and I'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like that is me that is me I'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> complaining because that's what I like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah I'm a fan of both those yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> damn it's fun doing nothing you know it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feels really really good just having </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this nice experience of just like just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah kind of just doing nothing and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just taking the chance and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> environment in right let's go to that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like damn I felt this somewhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> before why ever felt this before Oh this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the exact same feeling I get when I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> watch every [ __ ] Slice of Life anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like why is it fun to watch people doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing yeah yeah and I'm like holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I get anything I'm watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> people do nothing no no no it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this idea I think the appeal of Slice of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Life comes from there where it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know I think a lot of the reason why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> science lab especially in Japan is so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> popular is because the main demographic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of people who watch Slice of Life are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people who have nine to fives super busy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> schedules yeah always working always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have something on their mind and their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one Escape is to just be have this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mutual feeling of I'm doing nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing but it's relaxing yeah right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe they themselves don't want to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in a position where you know maybe they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't have the money all the time to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually go out to the inaka and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wonder because that's enough in my head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I still watch animates like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> brain is being engaged right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even even watching Slice of Life though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah even watching really yeah because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm watching it and I'm like this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> still doing more than nothing oh no in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my head when I was Slice of Life I am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like brain turn off mode I'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like watching moving images </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so I don't to me I'm watching it I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like this is requiring effort to watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and I I'm I'm just bored yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it gives me like it just gives </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me that like same relaxing freeing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feeling I'm trying to like verbalize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of the you know kind of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experience you get when you go to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place like this in the middle of nowhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan because I'm sure there are other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> place like it's it's it's it's not it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> off of Japan it's like that I believe 40 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> out of the 47 prefectures I like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nearly all of the prefixes I'm not like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not trying to say that oh doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing and taking the environment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a Japanese thing only Japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> people have figured out how to do that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know but they've certainly perfected </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it though they have certainly perfected </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it it's it's definitely what I'm saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like we have optimized doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no I get it it's like I just think like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the word you're looking for is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what I like about it's again it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that feeling of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um because you know I think in a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ways like for me what I like about Slice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of Life is that a lot of Slice of Life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is you know based around a lot of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the inaka and like you know in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mountains of Japan or like in places </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where there's like not a whole lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happening and so yeah the countryside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like the countryside like and all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these characters have to find a way to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do certain things and for me it's kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of special because I spent a lot of my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> childhood like that in Japan like when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my grandma lived in the middle but [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nowhere in Miyagi we had to make our own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fun like we were just surrounded by rice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fields we were like all right the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are we doing today right so I think I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> relate heavily to that feeling and it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like kind of looking at my childhood </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through like roast into glasses in a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sense but like even as an adult I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes watch Slice of Life you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I recently uh you know caught up on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Euro Camp right yeah and I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why is this still fun to watch for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> even though technically nothing is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happening it's because again it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that feeling of like being content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the fact that nothing's happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but that's what's so nice about it I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think because I've realized I I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> know what it is about Japan right but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan has just perfected Vibes unlike it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just no matter where you go whether it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like the city or the countryside locally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a true Instagram all right it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> literally that Tick Tock meme in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just [ __ ] Vibes right I I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know why I don't know why I wonder if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's because you never had the time or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> disposable income in the UK to going on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these trips Maybe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> huh because there are some places in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Europe in the UK that are pretty [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> chilled too oh no yeah I'm not saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a Japan only thing right I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just I'm just saying that Japan did it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan it's it's so easy it's so easy to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> find in Japan yeah get your phone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> replaced until you have to get your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> photos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know yeah it's like I had a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time of SoftBank so you know what I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna do to lie down watch some Slice of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Life I think how you're describing how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you view size of life that's how I watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> documentaries right right it turns my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> brain off yeah and I just listen really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I wonder if that's how people watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Trash toast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we might be a slice of Life show to some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> people yeah because I you know I just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> watch documentaries I'll leave them on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the background sometimes I don't really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> need to focus and it kind of makes me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> zone out and kind of chill out yeah in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> weird way don't know why but how you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> describe a slice of life that's how it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sounds to me but Slice of Life for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just stresses me out that nothing's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> happened it stresses me out that they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> not doing anything right that it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> moving yeah I think like for example </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that's why I really enjoyed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> non-numbiory because like that is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what my childhood was like in a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ways right like when I was visiting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan that's just what it was it was you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go out with your friends you'd find your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> own phone nothing [ __ ] happens at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> end of the day but it was still good it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> makes you feel this kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yearning Nostalgia even if you've never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grew up in Japan yeah you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely and that's kind of that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like what I feel even though I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have no [ __ ] roots in Japan but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> watching these shows and uh especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to places like this I'm like why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do I feel nostalgic even though I have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no attachment to this place you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and it's it's it's super it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weird super weird it's super weird but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like I said like I said like Japan is a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> country of Vibes and I think there's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reason why it's become one of the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> instagramable countries on Earth you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know like I'm not saying like I said I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> not like trying to like hype Japan up to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> be like oh you're like normal things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese thing like you know like but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's funny because in a lot of ways it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> true for a lot of people in a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ways it is true I don't know why this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> country is so [ __ ] aesthetic whether </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it be like I remember I remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> randomly I think it was like when we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> went to the [ __ ] junkadelic the last </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time right with all three of us yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh it's this you know Mexican placing um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh in nakamegara that we've talked about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in past trash Fest episode well like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> last time we went you know we had this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] amazing you know Mexican meal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then as we were walking back from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> John cadelic to nakamego station I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember God just randomly just stopped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why is Japan so [ __ ] aesthetic it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just like out loud I'm like you good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's just like that country where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> no matter what angle you take you you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just you just like snap a picture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> instantly instagramable you know and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't matter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you go to like a place like golden </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> guy and I'm just like [ __ ] this this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looks cool this looks so [ __ ] like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of this stuff does look cool yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like that looks totally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different from like just going out to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the countryside and it's just it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different kind of vibe but it's still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Vibes exactly it's still Vibes basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan is like Lo-Fi the country I just I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why I Slice of Life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> ages ago Silver Spoon oh yeah I hated it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> really oh I love I love it I thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something was gonna happen I love silver </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and nothing happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like what the [ __ ] I love it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because what is the point I love it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because nothing happens </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's just [ __ ] storytelling because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> something happens but that's the point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they're not it's it's like how you make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a story with no story yes like what they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> perfected and it's like who wanted this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well that's like that's like going on to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a Lo-Fi playlist and being like Oh the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> musicianship is [ __ ] no I like that it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's like it's like oh there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no musicianship in this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> whatsoever It's like because they're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying I I admire people who enjoy Slice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of Life I feel like there's just a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> mental barrier that is stopping me from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enjoying this whole genre </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and I don't understand yeah and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I just I just felt like annoyed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I I think I watched like four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> episodes of Silver Spirit why'd you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> waste my time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like I thought I thought something was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna happen right so before I knew it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was a genre yes yes so I watched it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like waiting for some plot yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> how do you say that because I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Silver Spoon is one of the best Slice of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in terms of the job in terms of what the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> genre has to offer yeah well I I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to be in it you definitely have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be in a certain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> mood to watch slices what mood no Story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> please I want no Story the mood to just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> zone out and just Revel in like just a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> nice comfy feeling I mean if you ask me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why I zone out documentaries I'm like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know I don't know see because I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the opposite with documentaries I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> forced to listen and my it's like an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> active thing because I want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> understand what's happened I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've watched so many documentaries now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where just the formulas feel so familiar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm like okay I can kind of figure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out everything that's going on right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> very quickly I feel for a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> people's Slice of Life I guess is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the the comfort food of anime right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like it's like I don't want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to think about it I just I know I like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this thing even though it doesn't you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know offer me anything new in terms of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an experience right it's just like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just something to have because I like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's fine I think what's really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> nice about slice of life is just it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nice escape from just the Daily Grind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> life you know it's you you get away from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that daily ground because what you do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> normal and I may not do that huh does </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> normal anime not give you the Escape of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a no because it puts you into I feel a a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> world that is not maybe not the same in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> terms of like the quality but in terms </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of like the the just the amount of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's going on it's like that's another </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing you have to like follow and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maintain and you know understand right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like you know you'd watch any show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like okay there's a world and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there are these characters involved in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this world that have to do certain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things and there's this evil thing and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> blah blah blah right there's so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things that's engaging right and and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like I'm not saying that's bad or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything like but I need to be in a mood </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes I'm in a mood where I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yes I want something that has a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> convoluted story with a convoluted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> characters convoluted relationships but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes I don't want to think about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that [ __ ] sometimes I just want to turn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my brain off and watch cute girls doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> cute things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you ever go on trips and just do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> nothing every ship I do is nothing right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so why do you enjoy that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> turn the brain off you know you finally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> get to there you go there's the answer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like I don't get that from watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some people go on trips some people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> watch last night I wish I wish I could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> do that from a TV show but I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's but I think that's why a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a different kind though like just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in my brain of watching your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> documentaries not the same as going on a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> trip and yeah yeah just relaxing and not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking about anything but I guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why you know there might be a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason why Slice of Life is so popular </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Japan is because some people you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who work the salary of man life yeah who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> work the nine to five six days a week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> can't afford to go on these also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes it's just about like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about the small things you know it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the smallest interaction can bring </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you likes okay so actually I'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just remember like something that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> happened to me on this trip and it just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like it just it was just such a such a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> nice by the way my argument is not don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch Slice of Life go outside that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not my eyes I I no we got that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like that doesn't surprise me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean for the longest time I didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like slices but for me I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe it's the older I'm getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> um and the more I my uh likes and what I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want is revolved more about actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going outside yeah doing stuff no I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> totally get that as well I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why maybe there's some scientific reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that when I you know because I used to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> be like online 24 7. and I'd never want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to do anything else yeah but now I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know I don't know if it's about job or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what that we're online all the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a big reason why I don't watch as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much anime as I used to because like for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me now it's like yes there's a part of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it where it's like yeah sometimes I have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> enjoyment from watching anime and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there's sometimes where I do want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watch anime like you know I wanted to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> finish Euro camp and I did and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> great but now I have other interests </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where a lot of it involves me going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> outside and doing real life stuff yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like is that me falling out of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> anime or is that just me growing up as a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> person and my interests change I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I don't know I don't know yeah I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> mean going back to slice of life I still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't like every Slice of Life like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah I still will never ever ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be able to get into chaon for example </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't you dare [ __ ] slander </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel so boring I feel like there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> only a handful of Slice of Life that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I actually enjoy and I've noticed a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pattern that all every Slice of Life I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enjoy are like replications of stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I've experienced before yes like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never been a cute anime girl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> drinking tea and you know like trying to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> form I mean I've had apart from the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> forming a band bit that's the uh that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the only thing I can relate to so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whenever it's anything but that I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because I have those memories of forming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a band and hanging out with Batman's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> granted none of us were cute anime girls </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and none of us drank tea you know we did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other things instead of that but it that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that feeling of like you know just doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cool musical [ __ ] together with a group </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of friends and the troubles and you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> small turmoils that at the end of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> day don't really [ __ ] matter because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's just a bunch of kids all right like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the part of K on that I connected </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with and that's why I enjoyed it [ __ ] it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I saw chaotic like pissed me off I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you're trying to trying to stop ban </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you were eating tea and drinking like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're you're eating cake drinking tea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every [ __ ] day no wonder your music </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> career is [ __ ] but I do do some [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> work just a [ __ ] bad practice man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Jesus Christ come on see I can't get mad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at that because that's exactly how my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> high school bands went I think we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> practice maybe 15 minutes yeah like most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of the time we're just [ __ ] around my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> band practice like when okay in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> fully wire band never popped in my in my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> band experience this is my [ __ ] bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experience yeah had nowhere to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> practice our instruments right because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we lived in the city and you can't make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so some you can't make noise so we had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to hire out a studio in order to like in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> order to also time mattered yeah so time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] mattered yeah we had two hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to practice we are [ __ ] right in [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we were [ __ ] practicing we were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> booking our next get them big and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> working towards that so so I was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like no there is no time to [ __ ] around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no for me it was for me it was oh it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the weekend let's go to the drummer's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> house because the drum set's already </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there put up a big [ __ ] mattress on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the doors and the wall so that it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sound proof practice for maybe I don't </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> just I agree with this when it's your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> life that's a slice of your own life I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> don't want to vicariously look through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it I don't want to [ __ ] watch someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> else succeed in life yeah have a good </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> interaction to be the moment where you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go home and you watch a slice life and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like that's like me for real it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a bit different you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it never happens it was no it wasn't it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't that exact moment but that kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of like cemented it for me where it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just like right oh I I get it it's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> little moments it's it's like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know when you the little moments you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> see in Slice of Life where it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> people going on adventures what I said I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had like the inverse where that is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sort out some [ __ ] other payment for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my other SIM cards and these foreigners </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> walked in and started and they were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 80 years old yeah foreigners I'm [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> foreign these other foreigners walked in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh they were clearly tourists and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like yeah like 80 70 very very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> elderly yeah uh and they started talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the people and they cleared in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spaghetti Japanese I just got up to them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like hey what do you want by the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what are you what are you what's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wrong yeah uh because the Japanese </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> yeah uh and they were like oh uh our SIM </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cards don't work and on the top right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> corner it says docomo so I think that </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> can't help you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I'm like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> it turned out they bought their SIM </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> cards online and and they they can call </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> each other yeah you can't it's the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they don't give out phone numbers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the point where it's like how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> many layers do I need to go down to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> explain yeah this [ __ ] ain't worse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> hey you because they were they wanted to </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> can't do that no you can't get a phone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> number in Japan unless you live here and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you you get a SIM card so I basically </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> won't be able to call each other save </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yourself 40 minutes grab a WhatsApp </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> not gonna be able to help you I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> babe they don't do these Sims you they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had data only Sim and they thought they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had calls because the advertising on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plan they bought said calls but it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of like a Skype thing and I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just like don't bother literally the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> dichotomy of the two different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> experiences </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're not welcome here you have a great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Slice of Life experience or you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we're talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> them I was like hey I'm a customer I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> paid the monthly and I've been here for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> an hour waiting for to get something to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> happen so I don't know man maybe you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> should just enjoy your day maybe you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should just have a good time yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like maybe you want to call each </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like you'll be fine no you'll be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right just just move together as a group </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you'll be a player I have noticed that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the more from like Tokyo southwards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> people are more fun more North not so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fun I think so people are way more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chilled the more south you go in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I mean yeah much south I mean I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guess West yeah Western South way more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> chill Southwest yeah yeah because you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> start going to like Tokyo people get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more chill also like are super chill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> super outgoing and then people get more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chill and then you shoot people are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> really chill yeah well everyone is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> really willing to talk really outgoing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> more North you go the less willing bro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> people in Hokkaido do not want to talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no no so I feel like it's it's kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah she's kind of like more West yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've noticed it's like like even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese they don't really want to speak </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to other jobs no they really don't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's such a weird cultural difference I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know if it's like the cold makes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> people not want to talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it is the weather I don't want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to open my mouth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going to speed I'm going to speak </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> from my experience at least whenever you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to a country that is more known for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like hotter climate things just move </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> slower right I think so yeah things move </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> slower and but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the offset of that is that people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> will just see more chill you know I'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> never forget what you said about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Australia when you went you were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like the UK but everyone's happy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah I mean it's true it's true </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there's more children it's it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's interesting yeah it's probably it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> probably the weather to be honest yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the weather certainly helps yeah I mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like maybe but it's like there are some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> parts of like like Southwest uh Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like the weather is not that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> great right so me I'm sure the weather </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is a fashion but it might be like some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like actual cultural route of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> spanning however many generations that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just ingrained into the the local </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> culture there I don't know it's like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shoes really chill everything everyone </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] traditional Japanese house ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right like just like literally the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you see in like non-non Bureau like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Slice of Life [ __ ] it's that kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> house and I remember just like while I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was in that house everything just moved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really slowly and I didn't care about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what time it was or what we were doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we were just like chatting and chilling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the living room and just like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know my friends like Dad like collects </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all this suck and he was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> showing us all this [ __ ] I'm like I you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know it's not like I was like super </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> engrossed in what he was talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was like you know what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] with this this is kind of nice and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why I like that because you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> guys have like a sanctuary someplace you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> go to that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the toilet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's surely that's yours you spend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] 19 in your life ain't no way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the toilet for you you [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> speed run that [ __ ] with those 10 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this [ __ ] like I'll see you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> next year when he's on the toilet yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no I'm talking because the toilet's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the hyperbolic I'll see you in 20 years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm talking about like a place that you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can go to and it's always going to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the same it's always going to give </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you like Comfort whenever you need to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like take a break or something like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can can be like Parks it can be Parks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know for me it's not necessarily </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the place it's more like how I'm what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm feeling and what I'm doing and as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> opposed to the place I feel like then if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I put too much weight on a place and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then it changes or whatever I'll be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> no that's that's the thing right because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll be sad that's the reason I brought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it up because I know a few people have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like their own Sanctuary most of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time it's their home especially if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've you know moved out your country </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without your house your Sanctuary is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like your home and I'm wondering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if you guys have ever had that moment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you're just like really looking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forward to coming back home come to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place you haven't been to for a long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time but you've valued for a long time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then something small changes and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like I hate it I hate it how dare </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this small thing change even though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the natural course of Life yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like how dare my favorite restaurant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> near my house like [ __ ] closer like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that yeah and you're like how like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like nothing hurts more like perfect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah so like my grandma's house for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> example in Japan is like a great example </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of that I haven't been back since she </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> moved before the pandemic started yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and when I say she moved I literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean she moved from an apartment that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like here to the apartment literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> across the road so in terms of local </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> area nothing has changed right but I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> going back like at the end of the month </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so you know to celebrate New Years and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just dreading I'm like it's the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's not the same something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> something about this is not the same not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the same even though it is the same and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like it's still in this it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> still in the same town it's literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> across the road like if I wanted to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the old apartment it's like a 30 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> second walk it's right there but I'm I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just dreading there's a part of me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's dreading where I'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not gonna be like it was before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't it and yeah especially going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your Grandma's place yeah that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something that always felt like it never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> changed like your grandparents place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was always that was always the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] when you were a kid growing up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> teenager yeah I like my Grandma's place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Australia That's My Sanctuary because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like that [ __ ] hasn't changed in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 50 years yeah he's been living </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there her whole life I'm like that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good but my grandma here I'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you've changed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how dare you change maybe I'm weird I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> always liked you when it changed I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like really you're you're upgrading or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're changing things yeah that's cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but don't you feel like I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't you feel like you'd lose like even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a little bit of like that Nostalgia yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I mean yeah sure but like does that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean for me it's like I don't really I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> don't really mind it's whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Nostalgia certain types of people man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Nostalgia is overrated I [ __ ] love </SPEAKER_03>
