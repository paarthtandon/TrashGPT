<SPEAKER_01> - Man, I'm tired. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gamers, gamers, gamers, you
didn't even have class today </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like more dead
than when you had class. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're doing the Skype? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's wrong with you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Welcome to this episode of "Trash Taste" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I don't know what
we're talking about today, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'm joined by the
boys who also don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> what we're talking about today. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's good to have a normal episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like we've had a few now where, God, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm finding it hard to
talk now, Jesus Christ, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I need to like fire up my brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - There're so many things
that I wanted to talk about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a week, two weeks
ago, but I just couldn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause we had like themed episodes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, okay, for
example, I'm gonna just go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> right into the topics. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sure.
- Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've had a few topics that
I wanna talk about as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but we can just quick
fire through every topic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that we wanted to talk about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Go for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - About three weeks ago, I was scrolling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the YouTube.com app at
like midnight, pretty late, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I was getting ready for bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some reason, this genre of video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is starting getting recommended to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which was about like dangerous caves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you ever seen these videos? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
- Maybe I have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Basically, it's just
about caves that people go, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it's literally called caving, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where they go and explore caves. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- All right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it like uncharted and
unexplored caves or is it like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's sometimes uncharted
ones, sometimes explored ones. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it was just one of
those things where I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I do not understand why people do this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I could not fathom it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So there was this one
video, I can't remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what it was called, it was
talking about a cave in the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and this cave had a section in it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where the person has to
crawl through the cave </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on there, like you cannot
turn around, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you are crawling like this, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For like a mile. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh, I feel like I've seen that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like just wide enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to fit a single person, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - One person go in it
and you can't turn around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> until you get to the end of
the part or the middle section, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where there's a part where you
can stand up and turn around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was like very--
- That sounds horrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I could, to myself, I'm like, yo wow! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is a claustrophobe's
worst nightmare. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I watch some of these
videos and I get anxiety </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just from like, not even watching it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but just from the idea, thinking about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and some people do this with
uncharted caves as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> which to me just blows my fucking mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I get, if we don't do it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somebody is gonna have to
be crazy enough to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like who dead ass looks at like a hole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but just goes on forever and is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "I'ma crawl through that." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so it's horrifying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause there was like the
thing about this video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the cave is blocked off
now, so you can't get into it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you still can in
different ways apparently, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but what ended up happening
was there was a flood </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> while four people were
inside the cave and yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they obviously drowned </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause they were stuck in the
part where you were crawling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - This reminds me of that
scene from "Japan Sinks." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's so horrible
and I was like, I have seen, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I've watched documentaries
about horrible stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you watch some videos
about horrible stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like all kind of horrible stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and nothing got my
anxiety going like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it was just awful,
I was like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And yeah, there's YouTubers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> who their whole channel is
that they just explore caves </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that have never been explored. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is like simultaneously
the coolest thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but also why the fuck would you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why don't you just like review stuff? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, why don't you like react? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You could've made your YouTube channel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> around anything else. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so cool though
cause like you sit there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's someone was
asking one of these YouTubers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Like why do you do it, why
are you climbing caves?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, "Oh, cause it's
like the only place on Earth </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where like no one can communicate to you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and no one knows anything about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's a secret to discover" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then that way, I kind of-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Go to space.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Go to space, I don't
know about that, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh yes, I'll get on my rocket ship, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel it's a lot cooler. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe, but there was this one video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about this cave in, I think it was Utah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's called like the Nutty Putty Cave </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that's because apparently,
the soil is of a texture- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nutty Putty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was Nutty Putty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so apparently,
the cave was like putty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That just sounds like a euphemism. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And there's like, so let me
paint a picture of this cave. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's basically, this cave
is essentially just one cave </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just goes down, deep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was a pretty well-explored cave, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so most of this cave was all really, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like really well-documented
and mapped out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it wasn't a cave for
like super, super experts, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like, oh, if you'd
like caving, go in there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's fine and there's two
paths points in this cave. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One were you supposed to go down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and one that is too thin to go down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] All right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the other part is
called like the birth canal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in this cave, it's so tight, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That you have to grab,
once you get your hands </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> through this cave, you have to
pull yourself vertically down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause it's too tight, so
you have to pull yourself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So what happened was, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> The reason why this cave is
now closed and why it's famous </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that there was a story where this guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> went down the wrong way and he thought, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because he it was getting really tight, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that, "Oh, I'm in the right point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "cause this is the birth
canal, as it's called." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So instead of thinking,
ah, maybe I should like stop, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wait for my mate, he's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "All right, I should keep going." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So he keeps going down
a point that's too small </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just get stuck headfirst down a cave. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And we're talking like proper
like tight, the whole thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's really brutal,
cause this guy's stuck there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for 12 hours and there's
like tons of rescue attempts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> from like people and eventually
just dies cause obviously, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's upside down for 12 hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just horrible
hearing this and also, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> could you imagine being a rescue worker? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like having to get someone out of a cave? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I felt like being a
rescue worker in that sense, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're as likely to die
rescuing the person-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At one point, one of the
rescue worker get stuck with him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because he tries to go
down the same way just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to pull him out and
gets stuck, but luckily, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they get the rescue worker out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then I was thinking like,
is this just a bunch of people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> who are rescue workers? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Who are trained in like cave rescue? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause that seems like harder
than the actual caving. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like you already have to be good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> at exploring a cave, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, how can you
even be properly trained </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for an environment like this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, because surely, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like that's such a specialized job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause you have to set up a
bunch of winches in a cave </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that's not set up for any kind of-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, also, like what life
choices make you decide, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna do something
that's even more dangerous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than cave diving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's helping people
who get stuck cave diving. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - At least people who skydive
or do risky stuff like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> at least you get a quick
death if you fuck up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but with like caving-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the part that fucked me up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that if you're stuck, you're stuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a slow death. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just a slow death
and you're in a tight space. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Ooh, I'm getting anxiety
just talking about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not even claustrophobic
and that makes me-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I was like exploring caves, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that sounds kind of
cool, I'm down for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Exploring caves where, I once
I go in, I can't turn around, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that scares the shit out of me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That sounds terrifying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna turn, I wanna
be like fuck, go back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Because if also, more often than not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's recommended
obviously not to go alone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What happens if the guy in
front of you starts panicking? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you're the one behind him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cause there's nothing you can do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah
- You're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> cause then you're gonna start
panicking cause you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fuck, I'm stuck, the guy
in front of me is stuck </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause he's freaking out,
should I be freaking out? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> He told me this was a good idea, fuck! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like in the horror movies
where you're in a group, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a group and then someone
says, "Oh, let's split up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "that's the smart thing
to do" and you think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who in real life would actually do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like these are the people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are just like making the decisions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you're just questioning, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> why the are you making
this decision right now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> This seems like a really stupid decision. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's why I hate most
like modern horror movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they always throw in that trope, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as if people watching this
in the cinemas are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Finally, someone made a good choice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "in a horror movie, to split up." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Also, another scary thing
about being stuck underground, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> no signal, so you can't call for help. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, fuck! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The only reason in
that Nutty Putty thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is why someone got help because
his brother was with him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and was like, "Oh, he's stuck"
and went up to get help. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But that's brutal, imagine watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just your family member just die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just slowly die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's horrible, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I can't fucking imagine it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sorry to start this
podcast on a morbid note. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And to top it off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not even like a cool sounding place </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to die either, it's like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that cool? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What are you like, bro,
at least die cool bro, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My brother got stuck in a cave. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, I know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like there's like a
difference between like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh yeah, my friend got stranded
in death valley and died </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> versus my brother got stuck
in the Nutty Putty and died. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, it's a little unfortunate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This sad as well, cause in
the part of the story as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like he just had like
two newborn kids or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ooh!
- Ooh! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's like, why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like the video starts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> He had a kid, he decided to
celebrate by going caving </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, no, why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, It's funny cause
I've been recommended </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I would say not like a
similar genre of YouTube videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but just like in the opposite
sense, which is just YouTube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was who just climbed really high places. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh!
- Oh, the over climbers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And to like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I kind of get that, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't like similarly how
watching these cave divers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get like a claustrophobic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get vertigo watching these people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just climb really high places. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I also have a fear of
heights, so just watching it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess I can understand
Max I'm like, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> One, normally climbing is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> arguably climbing a tall skyscrapers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> probably safer than going
down a cave that's unexplored. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, there's a difference </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> between the feeling of being trapped </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and just falling from a very high place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can see why you get
that sense of freedom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> which is exactly the opposite
of what you're getting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's what I can understand that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> We get the view and it's pretty cool, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I kind of get it even though
I know it's in the same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And normally, I'm not
going to lie either way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> fin apostle-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, because like
I go recommend this video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the title of this video was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Reflecting On The Day I Almost Died" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh man, this is getting
a bit too real here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just this guy who is climbing up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this really tall building
in Hong Kong, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's just like this
POV shot and it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> him doing commentary over it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] All right.
- And so he climbs up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this really tall building </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in the middle of a, like
from kind of like dawn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So before the sun rises and
by the time he gets to the top </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the sun starts rising </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and so you have this
really tall skyscraper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and on top of this skyscraper, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's just like this
really rickety scaffolding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that goes like off like
another mile or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean?
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so he starts climbing
up this when it's like dark </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then by the time he gets
to the top, the sun has risen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he can see the view
and then it starts raining </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And he's up there by
himself and in the commentary, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he says that, "I had two choices, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "either I could wait up
there, wait out the rain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "and just kind of risk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Someone would see me and
getting a rescue attempt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "and I'd probably get arrested </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "or I could just attempt to climb down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "even though I would be more
likely to slip off and die." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So of course-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd climb down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He decides to climb down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like getting arrested and being rescued. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is literally the
horror movie split up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or stay together. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, that's what I'm saying, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> These people make the decisions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to do what we see as
like the dammer decision. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I feel like if
you're the type of person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who's gonna climb a skyscraper, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you're gonna be the type of guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who climbs down a skyscraper. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I guess in his
head he was like either way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to climb down, so I
might as well just do it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think there also is
a fair amount of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> who would rather die than be arrested. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe, probably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I genuinely believe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a sacks of people like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want a criminal record
so bad, I'd rather not exist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm gonna die here it
before I turn to all of you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think there's people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who would rather take that risk, honestly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, probably. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cause there's some countries, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> especially where you get that
shit, oh your life's ruined. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - True, true.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> America they don't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, most of most
developed countries, bigs up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean like it's, I
mean, I find it interesting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to watch people go through this stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah, I mean, I
could never do it myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the most I would
wanna do is skydive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and maybe bungee jump, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the more I hear about bungee jumping, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the less I wanna go through it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - For me bungee jumping is a hard pass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I think it's bungee jumping, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it very much depends on
where you're doing it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and what company you're doing it with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> or is it some dude and his
mate with a truck and bungee. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you in a country with
health and safety regulations? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the biggest thing I think about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hear people would like doing it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in like places where I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think you be bungee jumping there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've seen and heard more
bungee jumping accidents happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than skydiving accidents, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so just like weighing out the ratio, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I find that skydiving
might be slightly better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - More so bungee jump over
like water more often than not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and you don't wanna slap that water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly.
- No, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And bye-bye skin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Water fucking hurts when
you slap it at that stage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- That's speed, sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it hurts when
you're like belly float </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from like two meters up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let alone like 30 meters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I do wonder, I'm like what causes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like what happens in your, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are you born wanting to do
extremes like explore caves </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or go to extreme heights? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that like something you're born with? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Or is that something you like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It has to be something you're born with? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> All right?
- Or is that something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that like over your life, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something happens when
you're a kid and it just. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, because like I feel
that from a young age, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's always like the kids
who are going to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, I'm gonna climb
this really tall tree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Watch me do it."
- I was like that as a kid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I would climb anything and
then I don't know what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think maybe the first
time you fall over badly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like, fuck, this
shit actually hurts if you fall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's a difference between </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> when you fall off that
tree and you hurt yourself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the difference between, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> fuck, I'm never doing that again
or fuck, that was worth it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, can you pinpoint the moment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at any point in your
life where you've like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know exactly where your
fear came from for something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, your B, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - My B one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I still have that memory to this day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - For me, well, I'm afraid of heights, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but like not to bad, like it depends on-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think like this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> there was a little
experiment on kids, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There're some kids are
born, like people are born </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> with naturally a fear of heights. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, but I feel
that my fear of heights </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> came from the fact that
at my parents' place, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> we have this kind of spiral
staircase that goes down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh shit, did you fall?
- And I fell down that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh no.
- Oh no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah and luckily I
didn't like break any bones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or like hurt myself that badly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think I was only maybe
like two or three years old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I did and it's the
earliest memory I have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of me just falling down
and I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that caused a slight, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe like fear of heights or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Doesn't it scare you
that like little things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> happen to you as a kid could
just like, fuck you up? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It makes me scared
to have kids, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whoa, what if I like accidentally give him </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like too much broccoli? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he won't have chicken
and broccoli ever again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Man, like I traumatized him, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How do I know what's
gonna traumatize the kid? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hold on, that's the first
thing you come up with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Getting traumatized
with chicken and broccoli. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If my kid, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Doesn't eat the fucking cross, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna be sitting down the table </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like the bottle
of whiskey being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why do they all go wrong? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where's the fuck go that one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I used to be really claustrophobic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't really get that anymore, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I used to be really much the kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know exactly why and
it took me like years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to realize like, oh, that
probably was traumatizing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So one time our parents were out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was me and my
brothers messing around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we though, bro,
that's just a suitcase. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We can do so much fun stuff
with a suitcase for some reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So for some reason I
think me and my brothers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> decided we're gonna take
turns locking each other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in the suitcase, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I don't know why
we decided to do this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again we were like fall four or five, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I forgot how old we were. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I got locked in the
suitcase, bear in mind, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for some reason I thought
I should eat my Coco Puffs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the suitcase. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt giggling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was in the suitcase just
eating Cocoa Puffs, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> My brothers-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What was the point of this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What what'd you get out of this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I legitimately don't
know why we did this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just have this memory
and then they started-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just a kid thing to do, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then my older brother
thought it'd be funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to start flipping the
suitcase with Cocoa Puffs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then that was where I drew the line, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, get me out, get me out of here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that he wouldn't let me
out for like 10 minutes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel as well with that
kind of like childhood trauma, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it really depends on like
what your siblings did to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I'm very glad
that I had siblings </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause I feel like man, I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I learned a lot of valuable lessons. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's because me and my sister </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we kind of like think the
same way in a lot of things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so like we wouldn't do
something to the other person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we would hate to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - See this is is if you have-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Only child, whoa! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When you have like three
brothers, like I said man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like fucking "Wrestle Mania." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like we would like
genuinely have like full </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> fist fights, we'd like punch
each other in the face, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all that stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I hear brothers
would like Sydney and Russell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had a similar thing where like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> apparently they would just like
punch the out of each other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's just like sibling love, I guess </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - But we didn't do it often, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but if like if stuff got really like bad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like we had a really bad argument, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like we pretty end up fighting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt giggling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, going back
to, with a fear thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you know what fear like fascinates me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I forgot what the name is,
like Tyraphobia or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had that.
- The one with like the holes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Trypophobia? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Trypophobia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> The one where you like see
like a lot of small holes-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that one makes me feel disgusting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause like I didn't have a fear of this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think that literally
was a fear that got garnered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because of the internet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because we had like the
lily pond plants in Thailand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I grew up with them,
so the little seeds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I was used to seeing
this site everywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I had no fear of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then watching enough
fucking YouTube videos about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about this fear, I slowly
gained it over time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I just saw these
different like fucking-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Disgusting, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Disgusting Photoshop edits. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For me it wasn't even
like a YouTube video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It was literally just typing
Trypophobia onto Google images </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just the first thing you see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is just this row and row. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, don't fucking show any pictures. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't show it, don't
show it in the video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but you guys if you want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> then go for it, I'm warning you though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fucking gross. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm kind of glad that I had that though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause that made me like understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause when I was growing up,
I didn't really have, again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even though I was claustrophobic,
I'm not really anymore, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't give a shit now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I feel that that helped me understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> when people have fears
that don't make sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because before that
I didn't really get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if someone was
scared of like falling, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, oh it's just a
fall and you'll be fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a little bit of height, it's safe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but now I get it, cause
from that, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this makes no sense why
a bunch of little circles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> make me feel gross, but now I get it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - My fear of heights is really weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's only like
certain levels of heights </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that get me queasy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause like if you go up
to like the Tokyo Tower. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's parts of it where
the floor is made out of glass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you can see that.
- I'm totally okay with that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but you take me onto the balcony
of like a 10 story building </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and make me look down, that fucks me up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I think it's because
it might be because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like say with like Tokyo Tower,
like the glass thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you know, that is safe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you could stand on
that, you can jump on that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like you trust the engineering. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like they wouldn't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is Japanese standards of engineering. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> They wouldn't put this
here if there was a fear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that somebody could jump on this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you could break through it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I know I can stand
on that, look down on it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and fuck around with it
because I know that's safe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck around with it, what are you doing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Getting your chisel out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I could like fucking stamp on it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and jump around the stuff
just to like freak out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> whoever I'm with and I'm fine with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That doesn't scare me at all
cause I know that's safe, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you put me onto like a balcony </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I know nobody won't do it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but the fear of somebody
could come behind me right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and just push me over the edge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I have--
- That scares me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have that fear whenever
I stand on the platform edge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Japanese... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Trains. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I've seen enough anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where the main character gets shoved off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's nothing they
can do and I feel that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so whenever I'm like standing
on the edge of a platform, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I literally have to stand
at a 90 degree angle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because otherwise, I
just feel uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like someone could push me-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause it's harder to
push this way, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> At least if someone tries
to push me on the side </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I can like try to stop the momentum, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but that's literally nothing I can do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't walk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> cause like normally the
platform is so full, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And people don't stand on the yellow part </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is like the danger zone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like, if I need to
get to the other side, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll walk on the danger zone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but I won't walk there
if the train's coming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I'm like, I'm
not risking being nudged </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something, but if there's no train, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if I get pushed on the
tracks, I'll just get back up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Someone will grab me around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I've seen someone get, like
falling onto the tracks before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What happened, did people help him? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean obviously like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they have those like emergency buttons </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that alerts everybody, so
like I think it was obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like some drunk dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just out of his mind
trying to like get on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think there's posters all
around the Japanese stations </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being like, oh don't
get drunk, don't fall-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's something like 60 to 70% </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of people who fall into the tracks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> usually because they're drunk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which makes sense, but
yeah, I saw some dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like kind of stumble around
and I was like, oh God, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this guy is getting
pretty close to the edge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then sure enough, he just went. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh wait, there was someone
at our station one time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember seeing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, cause there was a
bunch of stretchers and stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unfortunately, they fell and
hit their head pretty bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like--
- The gap is big. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's really deep.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, so if you're not
careful, you can hurt yourself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> even if there's no train coming, but yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you guys have this like
a unfounded, like feeling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or fear or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever you see like a
big red emergency button </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that you shouldn't press
and your mind's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what if I press that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What?
No, I don't get that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I totally get that, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like every time like you would go through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the school hallways, there'd
be like the fire alarm button. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every time I would just
stop and look at and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God, I wanna press this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've never gotten this urge. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it's like I
feel that's an experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that only like the 0.1% of kids you knew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> ever got to experience it, like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, you just wanna press the button? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, why you wanna press the button? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was almost a
bragging right as a kid, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel being like, yeah, I've
pressed this button before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> We like, well, how was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, of course it's
like pressing any button. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause I don't know what
the emergency buttons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or the fire alarm buttons
you had in your school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but in like British School or my school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we had like this, it wasn't a button, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like a very thin piece of glass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you have to break
and I always wondered, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what does it feel like to
break that piece of glass? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I just wanna know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just wanna know what happens to that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I break that piece of glass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, it's like
what does it feel like? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it does it hurt? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it hard? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like how thin is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> How much force would it
take to press this button? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I do think, when you're
on a bus sometimes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you see that little puny little hammer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There'll be like this giant window, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there'll be this tiny little like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it looks like an ice pick and a tiny-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's another one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every time I came back from school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I saw that little hammer,
I was like, I wanna use that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think what happens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is when you literally that
thing like touches your thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it just shutters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was on a bus one time
when the windows exploded. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so what happened was,
I was near the back of the bus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was our university
and it was a varsity event, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so they drove the bus to the
like one hour university over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from Sandy to Cardiff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And when we were on our way back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the bus driver went down the wrong road. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Now, as you put it, you
are aware, roads in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you don't go on the
right one with a bus, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's way too narrow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So what happened was, is that
he went down the wrong road </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he had to turn around, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was like the road
was like this, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like a three-point, like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So we went down this way and
so he backed it up the hill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to try and turn around and as
he was trying to swing the bus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> back round, the house that was
in like the end of this road </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had like a pointing out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a thing on the edge of that property. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a tile and so as the bus is turning, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you could see, I saw,
cause I was sitting here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like on this side and that was the side </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where the window was, you could
just see this thing coming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think they were
like started screaming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when they saw it cause
he was getting real close </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it just went and
just exploded the window. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah and then the guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously heard the fucking
shutter and was like, "Oh!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So he backed up, goes
to try it again, boom! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Other window goes and there's
glass everywhere, but-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, was that like near
any of the students or? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but they all
ran to the other side. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, fucking hell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So like it was like, it was terrifying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and then the bus driver
didn't stop or anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He just like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'ma try this again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He smashed I think in total
three of the big ass windows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> on the side of the bus and then
just drove back like normal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jesus Christ.
- I'm sitting here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like glass everywhere, like what do I do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did the glass explode on someone? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but the thing
is right on the windows, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's common as you know this as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When they smash them into
their like the way they made, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the window smashed into like non sharp-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're like blunt, little-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Then they're a little like bolts, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they don't like cut anyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Still, that's scary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was fucking terrifying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So what happened afterwards? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What happened was is that we just drove </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the last 20 minutes with
no windows on the side </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then we got off and everyone
was like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And we all went and was like,
what the fuck just happened? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm sure that guy lost his job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, probably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No idea what happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> University never said anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How old were you guys? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like 20. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay.
- Jesus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This like a university bus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is my third year of university </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just went on with my day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, that was weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, never heard anything about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Felt like I deserved an
apology for having glass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> flash on my face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was it loud? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude, yes! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You ever had glass explode? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No I haven't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all giggling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have had like probably
the loudest sound I ever heard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was, have you guys ever
had like lightning strikes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like hit really close? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- To were you are? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, actually, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like you could feel the
shockwave at that point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I had one moment where like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I legitimately thought I was gonna die, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was in high school and like L, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the front part of our school
has this like big courtyard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looking thing and it's
kind of on an uphill climb, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so if you're standing like
right at the top of the hill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and look up, you can basically look across </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the entirety of the school,
which is kind of cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So then me and my couple
of my friends were there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like very lightly raining </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you can hear thunder
off in the distance, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it wasn't like a thunderstorm, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So everybody was outside
just kind of chilling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and we had this like one
really massive pine tree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna say it's maybe like
15, 20-meter tall pine tree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's huge, just like on the
other side of the school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was looking at it for some reason, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just kind of like waiting
for the bus, just like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What a beautiful pine tree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, no, no, because it's so massive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that it basically just
fills up your entire view </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then all of a sudden
it was just this like flash </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> of white and this the largest
fucking crashing sound </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've ever fucking heard
and what turned out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was a lightning bolt had
struck that pine tree </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that pine tree was probably
only about like 20 meters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> away from me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it was fucking massive
and it was crazy as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because like we're at the top of the hill, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you can see all the other
students across the courtyard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and everybody simultaneously
was like, like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously, I think I'd shit myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it was so weird because
that entire crash happened </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and for like 20 seconds
the entire courtyard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was just silent and we're
kind of just like standing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then fucking seventh grader, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like kids whose balls haven't dropped, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you all over sudden like, "Aaah!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This girl fucking
shell shocked and PTST? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And there was just this
fucking panic across the school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All the teachers like shitting themselves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The tree was on fire. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So like straight up,
it was just like a fire, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this 20-meter tall
pine tree was just on fire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was satanic shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it was crazy because
it was like it from, I'd say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> between a five minute span,
no, sorry, five seconds span, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it went from beautiful large
pine tree to just a burning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 20-meter log. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Darn, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's fucking crazy.
- Darn </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It really was scary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, again like that was probably, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought I was gonna go deaf </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause it was so fucking loud. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It was insanely the other loudest sound </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've ever heard was-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Clap my ass chick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's it, of course
you can't escape from me snake, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but the other one was,
we were playing cricket. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course, as the-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just give me some anime shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We were playing cricket
and have you ever felt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like how hard a cricket ball is? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I think I do.
- Yes, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That thing is fucking hard,
it's like a rock basically. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, it is a solid
piece of whatever it is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but we were playing cricket in school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was in the outfield
and one of the kids </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like kind of smacked it really,
really high up into the air </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was going towards one of my friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he was underneath,
he was ready to catch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was like, "Come on, catch
it, catch it, catch it," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think he miss timed it
because the sun was in his eyes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something, so the cricket ball </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> landed right in his forehead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ooh, God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the only way I
can describe the sound </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was as if someone in the distance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had slapped two pieces of wood together. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just like this clack sound </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the kid just dropped to the floor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We straight up thought he died. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause he just-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That shit is hard bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was that like the Mortal
Kombat moment where. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (all murmuring) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a fucking fatality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, honestly, because it
went crack on his forehead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and he literally just
dropped to the floor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was he okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He was fine, like he
had like a massive bruise </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> on his head, but he-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Man, this man's got a dummy thick skull. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We straight up thought he
had died, we were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - The hardest I've ever hit my head, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is gonna be a strange story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was in sex ed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let me tell the story all, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It was I think second </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or third class of sex education, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> So you know how it is,
teachers wanna seem cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - How old are you at this point? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like 13.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So teachers like that,
we wanna seem cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> This one, yes, he's sitting at the table </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> some watching the video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why, is it a universal rule </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where the tables in the science class </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are taller than the ones
in the other classes? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You have that as well? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause you have like stools. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's like stools,
like marge, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's a pretty large table
and we're sitting on it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so we were watching this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and when we were all on the
table, all sitting together </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the boys watching the sex
ed and the girls obviously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And on this day I decided </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I was going to forego breakfast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought I don't need
a breakfast, I'm a king, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna go to my sex education mother </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm gonna watch it and
I don't need no breakfast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was feeling a little queasy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was like it's okay, it's okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're feeling queasy
watching the video? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was feeling queasy before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I felt even more
queasy hearing about this stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I was 13, they were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah, so goo comes out
of the woman's thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt giggling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> All right, so I'm sitting
there and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all right, okay, okay and
then I'm suddenly like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I just started feeling like, oh, whoa, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff's getting blurry and
then I fall on my friend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> next to me, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And my friend thinks classic Connor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> classic Connor fucking around, isn't it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So he just shrugs me off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so I go from this like
pretty high tall table, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like fell on my friend. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just dunk my head on this
like pure like concrete floor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I wake up and I come to
and I just hit like screaming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I look around and all
the kids have like ran </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the other side of the room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just waiting here
like, what the fuck's going on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't see shit, cause
like my eyes are so blurry, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I hit my head so hard and
I'm like, oh, what's going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I'm literally, I remember I sit up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, what's happening? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you initially
fainted from a sex ed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I got so much shit
for it as well obviously. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's such an anime moment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah and obviously in school I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "Ah, Connor fainted cause he saw a dick." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> That's when I started fighting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm kidding though and so I
couldn't see for like two hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Vision was blurry and I
was like, fuck, am I blind? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But then luckily it came through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think I was just
very heavily concussed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're blinded by the dick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Blinded by, they was showing
Johnny sins his first wo-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, oh God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, that's like a death
sentence in school man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was okay.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So now you know, not to skip breakfast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that was my bad cause yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I often felt pretty
fucking sick all the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So yeah it was my bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, they just didn't help. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know, just hearing all
this stuff at that age, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like fuck, that sounds disgusting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate like slime and goo so much, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> so hearing it come out of like body parts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> makes me feel so gross... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's the way they phrase it too, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because the only thing I remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from my sex education thing,
cause I think I was like 11 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> or 12 when I do the first
sex education thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So already it's like, argh,
for a lot of kids, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like the only thing
I remember they told us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is the only reason I remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is cause it's so fucking
weird to this day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was dead ass the first thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the sex education teacher
said she was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay everybody, get your index finger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "and put it on the inside of your mouth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "and feel your cheeks" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, okay, then that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "That's what the inside
of the vagina feels." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh!
- Oh! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's so cruel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And all the girls are like, "Oh!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And all the guys are
like," Oh, hell yeah!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well you were to it, you
went to an all guys school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, no, this
is in elementary school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh.
- Elementary school, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Darn, that's the only thing I remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just don't remember what
it was that like set me off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was like, I don't know
why the fuck they showed this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- All right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But they were talking about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I this is way too much information. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So here's a timestamp on screen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where we skipped talking about this stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so go and sketch it,
maybe it's kind of likely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to leave the room, so they
were talking about discharge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For girls, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it wasn't enough
to just talk about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They had this like
reenactment of this girl </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> who goes to the toilet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they dead asked to do a
closeup shot of like white shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on her pants and I'm
like, that's disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why would you show that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're like 13. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what like made me feel gross. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you have to watch the obligatory, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like woman giving birth? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I was gonna talk about that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I swear to God,
whoever was like editing-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was like on a
British TV there as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> They showed births. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You serious? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, there's a whole TV show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, you had like specialists videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that schools like bought to show us like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's so graphic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah and I mean, the person
who edited like our video, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they must have known what
they were doing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, so this guy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this old British guy
was basically describing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the process of a baby coming
out of a vagina, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And so what they use to
describe what happens, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the process of this happening, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is they take a rubber band, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He takes a rubber band and
just like, he just goes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine this is the hole
in the vagina, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is what happened
when a baby comes out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he literally stretches it like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the class goes, "Oh," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and shit you know, they
then hard cut to like a baby </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just like crowning
and just like coming out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like, thinking
back to that moment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like, I
think like in the moment, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like the fucking editor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> knew what he was doing there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not even like a cross
dissolve, it's just a hard cut. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just a straight up hard guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> He knew exactly what he was doing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just like one of those
like, whooshes in like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just a fucking baby's head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God, they were so disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, obviously I'm glad
that I was taught this stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but at the same time did they
gotta go in so goddamn hard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> on that shit, that like eases in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was brutal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No one enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] No, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one was like, "Oh,
this is interesting." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone's like, "No, oh fuck!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like it's a thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that does need to happen though cause-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, obviously I'm glad that I taught </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> cause I speak to Americans
and sometimes they're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I have no sex education at all." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, like Sydney
learned her sex education </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through her toy and I mean-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's boring. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is boring. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like, what is it like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> A lot of the States they
just say, "Oh, abstinent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Wait until marriage." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> That's legitimately like I
think many of the States-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I think it depends on the States. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not mandatory or something? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no.
- Oh , really, wow! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - In many States, the only
certification is abstinence. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Promote abstinence. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So like Christian
school, so it's not like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I think in England you have to do it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you have to teach it by law, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so in every, I think
like in age 13 gets taught, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like how to put on a condom,
how to do all that shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How did you get towards, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did you get like the fucking banana? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it was so embarrassing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This woman, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She was like, have you
seen "Matilda" that movie? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like what's that woman called? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like the devil teacher in that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> literally the woman looked
like that, dead ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Took out this like
fucking 12-inch dildo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> smacked it on the table and she was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> who wants to put a condom on this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Who wants to try? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then everyone was
like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why is it so big? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - A fucking dead ass dildo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was massive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It was huge. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, I got this from my own collection. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was why like, I
remember, I went home that day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, what is average dick size? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause I was like, that cannot be normal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That is like, that is 12 inches. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The girth of it was ridiculous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That was clearly her own
personal one that she brought in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, had to there and there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I have to do the banana. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I thought that was
just industry standard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, she put it, maybe there
was a banana and she was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "No, I'm gonna bring my own." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let me just bring my Aunt Summer's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like fucking pussy pleasure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dragon dildo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cause I think what happened
was they ended up teaching it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like we had so much of
it cause where I grew up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was like the worst place in
the UK for teen pregnancies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's so many, there's
so many that happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I grew up and it was, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously the government was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Hey guys, we know you're gonna do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Just please, please don't have babies." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Just do it properly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- At the right time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Remember like a few weeks ago </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was talking
about how my mum told me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that babies came out of the belly button? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So like she watched the
episode and she messages me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the day afterwards reminding me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that actually my very first sex ed class, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which was in primary school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember how old
I was, I think I was-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd have sex in
primary, I don't think so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I had like a very early sex ed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I had two or three during
my entire childhood, I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and it just like every sex </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd got like progressively more graphic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the older you get
which is how it should be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but she reminded me that the first time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I learned that babies didn't
come out of the belly button </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and came out of the vagina. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dead ass didn't believe them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I came home and I
remember this so vividly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because I remember the very
first time I tried lying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to my mum and it was like such
an innocent little kid lie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I went to the toilet
and I didn't wash my hands </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she asked me if I wash
my hands and I said, yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was the first time I
attempted a lie in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like the most vanilla
lie and she was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Let me smell your hands. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Let me smell your hands." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, oh shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the first time I
tried lying, I got caught, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that was embedded in me
from like a very early age </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just like people don't lie
cause people get caught </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> when they lie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let me smell your hands. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, so you believed your mum. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so my mum's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "All right, I won't punish you this time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "but let's just make a promise </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "that we're just not going
to lie to each other ever." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I like me, bright-eyed
like, five-year-old, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I believed her until
like I hit teenage hood. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So I go to this class and
people and their teachers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were telling us how babies
came out of the vagina </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually miss, I believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they actually come
out of the belly button. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know this, my mom taught me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And she was trying to console me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "No, they come out down there, your mom--" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sorry your mother is a liar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I'm sorry your mom is wrong," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so me being like the eight or 10-year-old, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, okay, there're
two adults in my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that have said two different
pieces of information. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I go back to my home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I go back and I tell my mom, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mom, the teacher taught me this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She said, "You are a
liar," but you know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You promise me that we
wouldn't lie to each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I believe you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I believe you, mother. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I know that babies come
out of the belly button </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's just like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yaiks! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And yeah, she just reminded
me that, that was a thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't actually remember when I realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that babies didn't come
out of the belly button. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Message, just blanked that out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh yes, thank you mother for
lying to me from a young age, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I know you're a liar now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember one time I had
like a bit of hair sticking up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and for some reason when
I put like water in it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it didn't go down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like, fuck, that's real annoying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like 10 years old and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just gonna cut it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's in the way, because
it wouldn't go down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I cut like a chunk of my hair out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then my mom's like,
"Connor, did you cut your hair?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, no, no mother, of
course I didn't cut my hair. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She was like, "There's a piece missing." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, I think it
got trapped in the door. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was all I said. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She's like, "So you're
telling me that it got stuck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "in the door with enough force </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "that it pulled your hair out?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, of
course, as if she's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Let's try it again." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, God, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I've never prayed for more of my life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that my hair gets ripped out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you go to the door, the
hinge, first of all, she's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "How did you get your head
in the hinge at the end" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, I have no idea about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I put my hair in
the door and I close it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and of course, no hair
falls out and she's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "What happened Connor?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then she's like, okay, mom, I cut it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause it was annoying me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> She's like, "Why did you do that?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, it didn't
go down with water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what I normally do and she's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Well, you didn't need to do that" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, oh, okay, okay, shit! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mine started earlier when I
was like stolen, like nappies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and stuff like that, all right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, yeah, like cause I had this really, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason I had the
fear of sitting on the toilet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> For some reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, because I think it was like two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or three years old, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like the last stage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of you still wearing nappies, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like, I really hated taking a shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I was really scared
and I think it's because, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think my mom explained it to me later, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> she was like, "I think you were scared </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "not to like actually sit on the toilet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "but to like flush the toilet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "because you thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "you were gonna get sucked in as well." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, not gonna lie,
there's those airplanes toilets. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh shit, oh my-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the airplane toilet fear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I thought that same force
was in my home toilet as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had the same fear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just fucking remembered this
and it came from an airplane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause when you flush the airplane, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it feels like you're gonna get like sucked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> into oblivion now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When I was like 10, what I would do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is I would like, fucking close the door, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause you had like two
seconds, you pressed the button </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and it goes two seconds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, yeah, so you have
like two seconds to get out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, I thought I had
that in my home toilet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So at that point, so
two, three-year-old me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was just like I figured out of
resolution, just don't shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm wearing nappies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't that like a South Park plot? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like I'm wearing
nappies, just don't shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like at that stage
as well, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was too embarrassed
to admit to my parents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I literally just shat in my nappies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what I would do is like
I would hide behind the couch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and kind of just like subtly
do it behind the couch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> While my parents weren't looking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And my mom would like
walk into the living room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like, "Joey, what are you doing?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would try and get a refund on the kid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> if they were doing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, "Joey, what are you doing?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like nothing and she's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You're pooping, aren't you?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Me while my face is straining like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And my mom's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I could literally smell
the shit from here." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Go to the fucking toilet." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God.
- And I would literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do that for like the longest
time until like finally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you get to the stage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you have to get
out of nappies, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I'm just like for the first like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You prolonged as much as you could. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, for the first,
like two or three months </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> out of nappies, I dreaded
having to take a shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, oh, I have
to like psych myself up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and be like all right, I'm
not gonna get sucked in today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You can do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all giggling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was horrible.
- Man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, I still have,
like, I still have a fear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of going to the toilet on airplanes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because of that noise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like if, if I need to-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But don't mind, shit's not pleasant. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not pleasant, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, I just get
like a small flashback </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> every time I hear that noise. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I need to wear like
fucking thick headphones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every time I go, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm turning that music. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro, that's what noise
canceling headphones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weren't built to feel like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like, cause you were saying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you didn't you'd never like lie, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we've never like lying
like your whole life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> up to like 14, whatever? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like when did you realize you could lie? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it was when I
realized my parents lied to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, I can't believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they've bamboozled me like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just realized it and I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, I pretty started to like lie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot more for a younger
age because I had brothers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because like you can't
lie to your parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause they're your parents, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They own you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You don't get to like talk back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, cause I didn't
lie to my fucking parents. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I said, like I got caught </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the first time I attempted
this, so after that I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is a loser's game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna lose when I try. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For me, it was like, when
you'd like go visit a friend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something and you'd like,
the friend would be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, I'm just gonna say to
my parents that we're here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "to do homework or whatever,
but we'll just go to my room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "and play games" and I was
like, no, that's not gonna work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My parents would immediately
see through that shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I would see my
friend, Dwayne being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, we're just gonna do homework" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the parents like, "Okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, you can do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna do that from now on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I think cause you
only have like siblings. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, I feel like
you end up having to lie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause you're always fighting and arguing-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right and but like I
was such a terrible thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> cause you have older brothers, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, cause I was the oldest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the family, so I had
to like teach my sister </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be like, listen, you
can lie to the parents. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen it happen, I've
done it before, she's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh my God, thank you brother." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Parents hate this one
trick, but people know it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I didn't like to
me learning I could lie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or learning that people was
like watching that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one life hack, YouTube video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was literally an actual life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was actually a literal high-life act. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But no, I feel like
that's why some people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were just like so bad at lying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because sometimes you
play a game of Among Us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can tell who the good
lies from the bad lies are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I've always had
this fear, like ingrains me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from a kid that I shouldn't
lie and even as an adult </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have a harder time lying
than some other people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's right, that's
why I hate playing games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Among Us and like
Werewolf or shit like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause I just can't lie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but it isn't
fun place to just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just have like a safe space </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> where you can all just fucking lie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and like laugh at each other-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, because I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't trust any of you motherfuckers-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why?
What, no! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like after this game is over, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think I'll be able
to believe anything you say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause it's fun, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause it's like you get to experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what it'd be like being interrogated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you committed like
murderer or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why was that fun? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, it's fun
seeing if you can lie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you can bullshit your
way out of it, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you can never
bullshit your way out of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> We should know this.
- Sometimes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why it's fun to
watch interrogation videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, they are naturally be-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm glad I'm not that guy right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the reason
why I watch Leaguey Sports </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> rather than actually wanting
to play League myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's funny to watch other
people go through pain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> rather than to have it hit myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's a really weird tangent, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's the closest
person I could think of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like seeing people suffer, not me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, who doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I think the reason
why mangas did so good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is cause it did give like a
thing where you can be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey man, there's not many games out there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "where you can just like lie"
and that's the whole game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like lying and
deceiving and that's fun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to get to do that and like
blow off some steam doing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I definitely do enjoy it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've played like plenty
of games of Werewolf </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I really enjoyed that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Among Us, I just didn't
get to play enough games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to really get used to it
cause I was still at the stage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they'd ask me what I was doing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I don't know
what else I was doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm following the map. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what the fuck is going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like those games, it was
fun when you would like realize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> after like one or two rounds, you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know who the gut liar is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Gotta take em' out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> So they don't get to lie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd say I never got to
that stage because in my head </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, how am I gonna
bullshit my way out of this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, by the time I had
started playing Among Us, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was already a fucking meteor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, what task were you doing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And so-and-so okay, I know your innocent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I just, I was getting smirked on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I really enjoyed it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think after like the first two weeks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the novelty really walled off on me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but obviously it didn't on YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> cause it was like, it had like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> well, like four, five months? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Entire career is what
created from that game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I haven't seen
anything blow up that much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> in a long time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's got crazy.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I feel like I started
watching Twitch contents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> way more after Among Us and four guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really took off last year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and before that I had
I'd hardly had watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any Twitch streamers at all
and the only live streams </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watch was like VTubers back then, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was mostly on YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it kind of really, I feel like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if it's just me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I like Twitch streamers is
like way bigger personalities </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than they were in 2019. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if that's
just my perspective, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I definitely see a lot
more Twitch people now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think at least, pretty
cause were on YouTube, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think what has happened
is that Twitch Streamers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their content that's being put on YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is doing much better than before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's before the
biggest channels would get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe 100,000, 200,000 views
if they air that videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they upload it, but now the Among Us clips </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> are getting like five, six,
seven, 12, million views </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like wow, that is nuts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I think it's
because I still don't watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as much Twitch, but I see so
many clips on my recommended </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and on my YouTube feed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't not see it now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm way more aware of what's going on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though I hardly
actually watched Twitch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I don't know, I'm
really enjoying it right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm really enjoying streaming so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you've been playing
like Apex every day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I'm gonna take Apex man, so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You found your new addiction? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah, I have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're just gonna end up
being like an Apex streamer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Probably--
- Full time, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, I feel like,
cause right now what it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that I just wanna play
this game and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> all right, I just happened
to put the stream on as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You see, like I can't do that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because like my not stream gaming mode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and my stream gaming mode is
like completely different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I agree, same thing here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - In my head I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I'm not constantly
commentating while I'm streaming, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then I'm gonna look boring
whereas if I'm off stream, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I am fucking silent for six hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, me too, me too.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean like, when you're getting filmed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had to like really force
like comments out of myself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's how I feel with Twitch as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where sometimes I'm playing
a game in Twitch mode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes I feel like
I have to force myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to say something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This isn't like my natural default self. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think that's normal though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like no one normally just talks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> while they're playing
video games themselves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's say that you actively learn to-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but I feel like sometimes
you think at least, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or you, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Actually, in some video games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't verbalize any of my thoughts, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> even it might mentally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> cause you can like mentally
verbalize your thoughts, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I don't even do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, I'm playing the game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's just all like instincts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I only got used to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I used to do
let's plays on my channel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but like before that,
like my first couple-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why did you do the let's plays? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, my first couple lets
plays, I was boring as hell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just cause I was at that
stage where I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay I have to say something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't just like keep
advancing with the game silently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I'm on camera, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but as I did it for
like fucking three years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or however long it was, I just
kind of learned to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here's something that I can
say, here's something I can say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to the point where I
found myself sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my non-recording gaming
sessions, commenting to myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, oh
no, this is a problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like 2:00 a.m and I'm
playing Final Fantasy 13 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm commenting to myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Commentating to yourself? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you streaming sharing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, cause I was still
living in my parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> back in the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so my parents would
come in being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Who are you talking to?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, oh my
God, who am I talking to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no camera rolling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not recording this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - My parents thought I was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> cause I was always on X-Box
voice chat talking to people, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they thought when I started
voice acting they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh Connor's just talking
to his friends on X-Box." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So they didn't know what I was doing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's just talking in funny voices. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I said, "Why is he saying the same thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "over and over again, huh? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Doing different inflections. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "That's really fucking weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Nevermind, he's probably playing X-Box, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Connor's a weird one." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got some weird hobbies, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I think my parents
definitely when I was kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they saw me as like the weird kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of like the four, they were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "He's the strange one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "but normally things work out in the end." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - He'll find his way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's normally the way it was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, like growing
up, sometimes I do wish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I did have brothers and sisters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I feel like, I
dunno how you guys feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about your siblings, but I
feel like there's nothing-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wouldn't wanna be raised
without brothers or sisters, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I think now that I've had them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I just couldn't imagine not
being raised with siblings. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't imagine just having
to share everything though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That's--
- Well, you don't have to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's how you learn to lie, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Although I did have to share
my X-Box and that was horrible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We have to like swap
every hour and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't even get a good gaming
session in here for now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, that's why I'm glad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the first like game console we got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was Game Boy Advances </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause we had one each. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was the first console you got? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Well yeah, like any console </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that we could actually share, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or wasn't like a, two-play thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause we had like the N64,
I used to like that too, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but if you have two controllers
you can play together, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but can't quite do that on a
on a handheld console, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] True, true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it was fucking fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like sometimes I'd wanna get on the N64, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> play a one-player game,
like fucking Donkey Kong 64 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or Super Mario 64 or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't play that with my sister. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- So I was like fuck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what do we do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's get a handheld console </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and just play whatever fuck
the games we want together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Problem solved. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Man, I miss being stupid
as a kid and I do because-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had this thought the other
day, I miss how simple it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> just to like find happiness in something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, so my first game-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Getting real deep here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sorry, my first game
console or game device </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was a Game Boy Color. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay.
- Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And my parents bought it for me in France </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they were like,
"What games do you want?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like Pokemon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- I didn't know at the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it says that the game
is in French obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause we're in France, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but somehow still managed
to complete the whole thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Wow!
- When I was like eight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or something and I'm like, I
would not have the patience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to fucking do that now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I don't know what
the fuck was going on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what any of the moves did, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think like eight-year-old
me had just understood </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that this set of letters
did this funny thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that did a lot of damage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> cause I had just been playing it so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I think by the time
I got to the elite four, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think nearly all my
Pokemon were level a 100. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was literally just
trial by fire, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was literally just
grinding and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how the fuck did I do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm so dumb or at least being that dumb </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I could just throw
myself at something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like I remember cause I also, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean I got the Game Boy Advance, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the first couple of games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I got were Game Boy Color games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you could play
the Game Boy Color games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in the Game Boy Advance which I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my God, technology, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I remember like the part
where I think about it now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's like, I definitely
had too much time as a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I could not sink into my adulthood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was when I managed to on my
Pokemon Sapphire cartridge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I played it so much that I
maxed out the in time clock. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like I found out
that on Pokemon Sapphire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> on Game Boy Advance. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it 1,000 hours or-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 999 hours and 99 minutes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is the furthest it will go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you just leave this thing on 24/7? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, that's how much I played it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I see it, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When you're a kid, you just get obsessed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like every moment, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because especially the Game Boy Advance, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like looking back on it now,
this thing's fucking tiny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, you can put that
in like jeans pocket </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like a jacket pocket,
take it everywhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - The best one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause I think it was
literally when we were kids </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> was that Game Boy Advance SP. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yes, oh!
- Oh! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Only the cool rich kids had a-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow, the SP was like the best one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause that like just
it would literally fit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in your tiny child jeans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember one of my Japanese
friends brought it to school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> once and he was like,
"Boys, check this out." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, whoa and it was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "And it's got a backlight
on it" and I was like, whoa! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You can play that at night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, the backlight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I completely forgot that
was the massive thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The SP was the first
one that had a backlight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and before then you had to attach </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like those like fucking reading lamp. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The fucking reading
lights, like the awful glare. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think actually the
first model of the SP </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't have a backlight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like the second model </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is the more popular model I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I had an SP and I got
one cause my friend got one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I saw him playing it and
for like Christmas I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mom I want nothing more than
the Game Boy Advance SP. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what game I
played the most on it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What?
- What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fucking GBA game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I played Pokemon Trading Card Game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Have you played that game on Game Boy? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was so good.
- It was fucking great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember like, oh go ahead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, sorry, sorry, I had a
finalization to this story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> One time I thought, I was so
addicted to this thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would literally walk
around the house with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would sleep with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh yeah, of
course, of course, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I was walking down the stairs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would play Game Boy
walking down the stairs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I was down at the
table, that'd be there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if It was going to bed, I'd play it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would even if I went to
pee, I would play with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Okay.
- So I would pee with it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> One time I dropped it down the toilet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not sure how it happened, I was playing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just playing
Pokemon Trading Card Game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was the cartridge that was there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was playing it while I was peeing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like 12, your little
dick's out, you're like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how I
dropped it, I dropped it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, how do I
explain this to my mom? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> How do I tell her that I don't
have a Game Boy SP anymore? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, it didn't work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you lie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, cause it smelled of piss as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> For some reason I checked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> if the Pokemon Trading
Card Game still worked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course.
- But of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I plugged it into the
old Game Boy Color I had. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, so I had to go
to my mom, I was like mom, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so this is kind of like embarrassing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I dropped my Game Boy down
the toilet and she was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "How did you drop your Game
Boy down the fucking toilet?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just really enjoy playing it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and my family fucking rinsed
me for like five years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, if that was my kid,
I'd fucking rinse him too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you know how expensive
a Game Boy Advance SP </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is at that age? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but they loved it
purely for the comedic purposes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Every time we'd meet someone,
they're like this is Callum. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's very successful, very smart. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> This is Connor, he dropped his Game Boy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> down the fucking toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all giggling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was so sad for like four months. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like this on
every window, I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what do I do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you ever get another one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did six months later for my birthday. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like,
- Wow, really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yean and literally I
remember like for six months </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like playing Game Boy Color again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just playing Pokemon Trading Card Game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with other shitty Game Boy-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your parents are nice man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I did that, my parents
would never buy me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a game cartridge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think they felt so bad for me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because of how like distraught I was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think they thought
I was gonna get over it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was sad for like half a year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, it's like dropping
a laptop down the toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I could not get over it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think my parents
at some point were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "All right, I think we
should get him another one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "or maybe like he's not gonna recover. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Maybe he's never gonna let
this go" and I wouldn't have, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I wouldn't have let this go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because like for me Game Boys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were the only game console
or like handheld consoles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that I could actually
get every game I wanted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's because every
year we'd visit our family </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Thailand and there's
always like that one store </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that my parents would take me to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it wasn't a legit Nintendo store. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really?
Really don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know if you could tell, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you basically go in the store </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they didn't have the game cartridges. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They would just have just the book </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you'd go for this book
and you tell these people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which games you wanted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So like my entire life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would have to wait
like a fucking one year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get two games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> One was for Christmas
and one's for my birthday </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that was like the N64. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Game Boy was like, this was
like the early steam sale. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would just like the humble bumble. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was free will instead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I would just go, I
would just go and come in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every year and be like, motherfucker, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm about to buy 15
games for like 10 bucks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I felt good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't like the
Chad like fucking like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'll take everything
from here to here please." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, it was such a good
childhood experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like to sit down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just I would be
there for about two hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they would like, every game
would have a different code. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I would fill up like A4 piece
of paper with just codes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like mother, give me all these games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I wouldn't even play all them games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it just felt good buying them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I felt rich for once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's because there was so many. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what it was
about the Game Boy Advance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it was like didn't know
there was a game with that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there is on the Game Boy Advance. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Well, I used to trade
games with the other kids. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I did that too.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just the games that I was done with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like Scooby-Doo Adventure, I'm pretty okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> knowing I won't play this again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If we go back to the lying thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've lied to one of my friends-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What did you lie? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, I had this fucking
like Mickey Mouse game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> on Game Boy Advance which I fucking hated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know where I got it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you hustle some kid? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Did you hustle some 12-year-old? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know where I got it from, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I got it from like
a cousin's hand me down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or something, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it was like, it was in that
bundle of like two or three, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like shitty, like not known IP, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get why does this exist type
of Game Boy Advance games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you get and one of
them was this Mickey Mouse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like fucking platform a game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even remember what
the fuck it was, but yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was in school and my friend was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh I got the new," this
is when Emerald came out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But side Ruby and
Sapphire at the time, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But I didn't have Emerald and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I really wanna play it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I was like and his friend, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my friend wanted like
to play this other like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't remember if it was
a Pokemon game or Mario game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something, like one
of the main line games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, "I really wanna
play this" and I said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> y'all got that game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So what I did was I had, the
thing is I did have the game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but I didn't wanna give it to him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I had the box for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No!
- No! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I did it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mickey Mouse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I fucking gebated him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I slipped the Mickey
Mouse game into the Mario box </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, here you go mate, inbox. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't have to check it,
now you can check it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you get home, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I took Emerald from him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I still have that Emerald
cartridge to this day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, did his mom not call
you out your mama who like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be like, "What the fuck,
your kids scammed my kid." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, maybe he really
liked the Mickey Mouse game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause in the UK, there was these like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd have like footballer cards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like Fantasy Football? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor murmuring) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know who was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't care about football. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just wanted the best stuff
cause I was like, it's a game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I want the best and I
was a real hustler, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would do deals, I'd be like
that stockbroker being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I can give you this,
I can give you that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Maybe, I don't know"
and one time I remember, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was really annoyed cause this one kid, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he did a really stupid trade
with me and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sucks to be human. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He gave me like one whole
DTO for like some two players </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that were terrible and I
was like profit, stocks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I went home, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought, great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm looking at my collection of cards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is amazing, I've done
such great business today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was literally like Trump
out of the deal at school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah, making good trades </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just chilling at
home, admiring my collection </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and my mum comes in being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Connor, what have you done?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, what have I done? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She's like, "Tim's mom has called up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "She's furious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You apparently you
stole a card from him." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like I didn't steal a car from Tim. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Tim's a fucking liar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Tim gave me Ronaldinho for
two of these shitty players. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She's like, "Really?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, yeah, yeah,
get him on the phone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll tell him what happened. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so I'm arguing with him </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he's like crying on
the phone, being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> "That wasn't a fair
trade, you scammed me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, I didn't scam you,
I don't know who's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just saw that this game was
shiny and you gave it to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I got fucking, I had
to apologize and give it back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause he made a dumb trade. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, that kid got lucky. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That doesn't happen
in the real world kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I'm like in the real world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that guy never would've
got his money back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He deserved to take the other guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was so pissed, I was like, mom, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you interfered in my negotiations. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you know how irresponsible that is? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That kid should have learned the hard way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that he made a bad trade. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your mom literally did
like a CIA drug bust. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Doom, doom, doom, open the door! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Even like 12-year-old me is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I think he should deal
with the consequences. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was a bad deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He agreed to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He should learn now that this shit hurts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> when you make a bad deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - He needs to learn a valuable lesson. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He learned the hard way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Clearly, his mom is cuddling
him too much and helping him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> What is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like the fucking Melvin capital? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like the fucking the stock trade? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's the American stock trade, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like people who watch the things being-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know.
- I don't fucking know that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Game stops getting out of hand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> We have to stop this, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They literally did that to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is fucked up, terrible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I was furious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I kind of like talking about this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is bringing back memories for me as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> cause the only time I've ever
liked tried to hustle people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was during like the Pokemon card era. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah, I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There was so much, I
think he just got normalized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that just kids would just
try to hustle each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll give you a 100 energies for Ho-ho. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Please, please. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I swear like around the world, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like we had the fucking like,
the big like cocaine thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in the 80s, but like the 2,000
was like the Pokemon card </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> equivalent and like everyone was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm gonna fucking scam
everybody for this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You don't know real hustle
man until you've been in school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> trading Pokemon or pugs or
whatever the it is like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I said, that's like, that's
where the real negotiations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happen, I'll tell you what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's where I learned
the art of the deal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause like away from the streets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I lived the hard way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cause like I remember when
I first getting into Pokemon, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I just had like the worst "Gacha" luck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was buying so many expansion
packs that I got nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I had like no value
that I could trade with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm just like, what can I scrounge up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I could sell to people with value. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So going back to the the
old game game cartridges </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I would always buy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I knew, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Even as a kid, I knew
like those game cartridges </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you get that says 400
games in one game cartridge, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would always buy them
and I'd tried playing them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know, they would
have like the shitest games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's normally 30 games
or like 30 games that repeat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was like 30 games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> from like a game that was
like a Chinese rip off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from like the older generation cartridge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And there's like
eight different versions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of Tetris on that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so I'm just like, I
don't need these in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'ma try to sell them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'ma try to hustle
these for Pokemon cards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, because I got these
in like Southeast Asia, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what it
was like in your town, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but like you couldn't
really get like knockoff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> game card cartridges or
knockoff game as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I only ever like saw them
once and my mind was blown. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, how the fuck did you get this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I would go up to kids on the playground </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like, yo, you
gotta Chinese Charles OD, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> lemme let me introduce to
you to my game cartridges. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yo, this game cartridge
says 30 games on it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Going as the recommended
retail price of one game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> That could be up to $10,000. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I basically pawned
off these cartridges </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that I wasn't gonna play
for shiny Pokemon cards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's how I got like at one point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the most like shiny Pokemon
cards on the playground </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I left three of them
in my life fucking jean pocket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the wash and they were just gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Lost. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I used to do something similar to that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but with Yu-Gi-Oh cards,
cause Pokemon cards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> got very quickly banned from my school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause like all the kids would
just like, even during class </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would just be fucking playing
around with it, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So we were like, all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, the teachers already
know what a Charaza looks like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Shit, they're
in it on the inside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But they don't know what blue eyes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> white dragon looks like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - What part of greed looks like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So let's move on to Yu-Gi-Oh cards </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I got so into like the
hustling of Yu-Gi-Oh cards, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like to the point where
like it was the peak </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> of fucking Obelisk? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The fucking like, you collect
the five pieces of Obelisk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in your hand and you're
like automatically win </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the game like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah yeah.
- Xodia. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Xodia, Xodia, sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obelisk.
- Obelisk is a different one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sorry, Xodia, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was the five pieces of Xodia, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, you could, that
was like a starter deck </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you could buy, everyone had Xodia. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Right, but not everyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had all the pieces, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the Xodia, cause you
usually in those starter packs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd get one piece of Xodia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember in the UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why I just did remember this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> They literally sold a
deck that had all the five </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Xodia that you could do
buy for like 20 bucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because for us, it was
like the old the booster pack </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like you'd maybe get
one piece of equipment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, there was booster pack, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> there was like starter
packs, I had all of them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, okay, so we didn't have
that luxury in Australia, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so the only way someone could
physically get all pieces </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the Xodia, was to do a
bunch of hustling and trading </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and get all the pieces and
so as like a 10-year-old, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I had like one Xodia
thing, but I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love this guy so much, I
wanna collect all of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All my friends have
all these other pieces, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but they're not gonna trade it to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because they realize the value of Xodia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on this market right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So I did ask, went up to
my dad and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> father you work for a
printing company, don't you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You have a high quality
printers at your work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Here's some P and Gs of Xodia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Could you print them out onto card paper </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and give them to me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Any full-on like printed out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these like pirated fucking Xodia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were like shitty, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like 240P qualities of Xodia, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But as a 10-year-old, you don't
know the fucking difference. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh shit, I just got mad flashbacks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Holy fuck! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I would come to school
and I'd be like boys, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I have all my pieces of Xodia. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - On terrible, like printed ink stained. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - One of them is in like 1080 P </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the other is like three pixels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Kids are like, "Wow!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, I can trade them off
to you as well, if you want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Man, I remember that like,
I really, really wanted like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think there was like
element heroes or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's like Yu-Gi-Oh
XD collection or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And my friend had them all, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I wish I looked a little closer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because he traded me them
and I was like I want them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty badly and then I
got them and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh wait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> They're like the descriptions really weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was all just like gibberish, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like fake Chinese sounding
stuff and then I realized, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> when I looked a little
closer, it was like printed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all like fucked and I was
like, wait, I just got hustled. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, it was all fucking
and I was like, so sad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, where the
fuck did you get this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You literally got scammed
into a Chinese knockoff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like you feel them, they look good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It doesn't look bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then when you look at
the quality a little more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like, oh wait. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Enhance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah and then you see like the text </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're like why is it weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking like Chinese sounding ass thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you wanna see something
like anxiety-inducing right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I remember I talked
about rhystic studies before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about how he makes magic videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So in his Black Lotus videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so like black load is a thing,
like one of the rarest cards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or expensive magic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Most expensive cards, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so he talks about how
you would like figure out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what a fake one is to a real one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and apparently one of the
ways they used to test this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is called the bend test
where you will take this card </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you will literally have to bend it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, imagine this is the card, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so you literally have to bend it there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and if it's a real card,
it won't crease at all, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but seeing this like $2,000
card being bent like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no matter if it bends or not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get anxiety and I have
zero knowledge about magic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or any investment in magic at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - All I know is there's
a video where a guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just casually talking
and he's opening packs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and then he opens it and
he gets a Black Lotus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he starts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor screaming) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that, it's so funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> He's like casually talking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then just starts freaking out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I gotta find the link to
that clip, it's so weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Narrator] And then the other on is boo! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Holy boosh! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Narrator giggling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's a fucking Black Lotus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Holy God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like the one
thing I've been enjoying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about like this resurgence of
like opening Pokemon cards. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like people
just like casually talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then just pulling
something really and be like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - People turn it into gambling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's flat return.
- Pretty much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause if you turn
anything into gambling, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's 10 times more fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is this how people feel
when they watch us roll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for fucking "Gacha" you on this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, the exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> This is why I went on a rant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is why "Gacha"
streamed for a long time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Did so fucking well cause
people love it when. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that dude who fucking, that Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like streamer, who was,
what was he fucking doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> He was doing Arknights rolling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - There was a guy rolling in Arknights, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> he was dressed up as a Yogi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, that's
right and he had life? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, every
time he did a "Gacha" poll, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like his life points would go
down and the Yogi was like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he was like screaming </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - He did like a fool, voice acting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, he was voice
acting and then he was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and when he pulled every
time he would make it sound </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like he was like summoning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He would like draw. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, he was like draw and then-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It fun really fucking good clip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Hopefully we can play
it for like one second. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, God, that's way too much act. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't be bothered to like come up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like exciting things
like that for streams </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is why I'm always
impressed with like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how recently you've been doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I feel like at that point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to treat streams
the ways the same way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you treat YouTube videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's what I
kinda I do sometimes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, right now when
I'm just playing Apex </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over and over again, I'd
already say it that way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like when I'm doing certain things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I do think of it as like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, just think of it as
if you're making a video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then just talk to the audience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that happened to also be
watching you made this video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the way I see it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think that when
you think of it like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a lot easier to
actually make good content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> live streaming, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but if you don't have
that frame of reference </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of how does it feel to make a video? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause obviously we have like
five years of experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of talking to the camera, making a video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but if you'd never had any of those, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, how do I explain
how you should behave? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Good content, but then again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I've still like a
lot that I can improve on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so I'm getting there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's a different field, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the way I see it is
that, I think either of us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can become successful streamers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just think I don't have
the energy to put into it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I would have to use the energy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that I put into making YouTube videos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into making Twitch streams. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> They come like whole and-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, there's, there's
so many YouTubers here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> end up just stopping YouTube
and gotta be a Twitch streamer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or vice versa, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's normally YouTube
has become too expensive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - For me, the thing
that is just stopping me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from making that transition is the fact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I wouldn't be able
to take a vacation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's like YouTube. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Before I moved to Japan,
people didn't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that I didn't do any work for a month </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause I was busy doing stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I prepared enough videos in advance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like everything was
running perfectly smooth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I was able to take a month off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is like, oh my God, that's nuts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You take a month off as a streamer, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like basically your fucked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - People would know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You just disappear off
the face of the earth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, pretty much.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, which is why, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Right now it's just like a fun
little side hobby right now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I've noticed that
I tend to, I use still, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> when I would do YouTube videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> once I finished with the video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would think about, alright,
what's the next YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video I'm gonna make? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I would think about that all day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What am I gonna make? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What am I gonna do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, I can make this, I can make that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like now I don't
really think that way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think like, I plan what
videos I'm going to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I don't really think about them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just kind of, until the
day comes where I'm making it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, all right, trying
to make a YouTube video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I feel is more
healthier in some ways, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but it feels weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It feels like I care less,
but I think it's a good thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've had to try and change my mentality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> towards that as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where especially hanging out with you guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just all constantly
compared to you guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feeling like I'm behind schedule </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's because I'm very like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my content is very like inspiration based. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I find it so hard to work on a video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if I don't feel like working on the video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't just like force the video out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I have to basically try
and schedule enough ideas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> ahead of videos I wanna work on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in order for me to be able
to meet that like schedule. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - See, I think inspiration
is a little bullshit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I think, I think you can't
rely on inspiration at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think if you did
what you did for the BBC. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't have a choice
if inspiration or not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, it's a
different career path, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it's comparing like a
office job to a creative path. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but I think for any creative field </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's important to discipline yourself to-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's something you have
to learn, but it's just-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I get inspiration,
it's fantastic, I love it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's so fleeting and
motivation is so fleeting as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, you just have to
discipline yourself to work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm kind of like halfway
in between I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, yeah, of course if I
have to, if time is crunching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I have to record something
in order to make the deadline </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then obviously, regardless
of if I'm feeling inspired </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or not I'll have to do
it, but for the most part, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, I wake up in
the morning and I think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, do I have to record today? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then okay, I'll record,
but if I don't have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I don't feel like it, I'm
not gonna fucking force myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean there's some
days where my mood is so bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm clear it's gonna
come off in the video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I just don't wanna do it,
but then it also in that time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, if I was gonna make a video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> well, I can't do that today, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll do something else that's productive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that can force me to
keep on top of things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like recently I feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I haven't really had that
choice because I think the past </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like four videos I've recorded this week </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> have all been pre-scheduled
on like certain days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and certain times, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean that's what I try and do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I try and leave a lot of
videos that are in the works, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of videos that are ahead, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so there's always something I can work on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't like to just
finish a video and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got nothing, what am I doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's next? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Huh? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it's good to have
multiple things your working on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, you have
to plan for the next one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> as your making the previous one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, which is also a thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's quite difficult for
the way I used to work. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I used to like, I had
to do one thing at a time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, same, same.
- But now yeah, I've got-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now I'm juggling like
seven different videos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, something like
that, I've got quite a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - For me, I'm either working on seven </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or I have no idea what I'm working on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No in-between and I need to change that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's why I feel
like I find it so scary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> if I was a Twitch streamer,
cause the Twitch streamer, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to start streaming
no matter what mood you're in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I feel like that it's
so much harder to hide that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> on a Twitch stream rather
than a YouTube channel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where you can just-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because it's constantly on camera. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- It's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I think the one
thing that's even worse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than starting the stream
when you're in a bad mood </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is when your mood sours midstream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah.
- You totally shit God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can call that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - When you'll start, liken whole happy-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You'll start in like an hour </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then maybe you'll get
like a text from someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like telling you like bad news </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or maybe someone will say something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like real fucking mood
or maybe something happened, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like the stream starts to go wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like when stuff starts going wrong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whilst you're streaming, it is
so much more mentally taxing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> than when if then starting
the stream in a bad mood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause you're like, it can't get worse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm already in a bad mood. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like fucking up on stage </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in front of an audience, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Versus just up in a recording booth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, right, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's big difference. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like some fucking clown. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This actually didn't bother me that much, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but this is like an example of something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that could happen, so like
whilst I was streaming one time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> something happened on my discord server, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where one of the mods
made someone else a mod </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who was pretending to be a mod. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So someone joined my
discord server saying, "Hi." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For some reason, I'm
not a moderate anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they have the same profile picture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the same name as a moderator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and someone else on my server thought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh yeah, that checks out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "That makes total sense." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Gave the moderator and then
they just start injecting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a bunch of bots into my server
and started like spamming it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so my discord server completely got raided </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whilst I was streaming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the whole purpose of
this person doing this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was to do it to people
who are streaming live, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they could get a reaction. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm there, it's happening
and all my chat is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Connor, Connor, your
fucking discord's on fire" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it'll get dealed with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Who cares. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's something
you can deal with later. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, that's like that,
but it's frustrating </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> when everyone was like, "Bro,
bro, you need to look at this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Look at this thing." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, I don't really give a shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like I'll deal with it later. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I was good cause
that guy was going around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to film TikToK reactions
of streamers getting angry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like glad I didn't
know that at the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but I was like, I'm glad
I didn't fucking react </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause I was like, oh, okay, cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sounds like an asshole,
dick thing to move. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, don't do that.
- Who does this shit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> People want attention, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It is what it is, nothing new. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, nothing new you in the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You just gotta deal with people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who always look in to attack you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, I get that sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get every now and then
these like obviously people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> who are just coming into Twitch chat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just to fucking get a reaction out of you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just spam bullshit and the
best thing I do that just works </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is like, I respond to them,
but in the most dead pan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking voice ever where it's like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Your normal-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, literally just my
normal like talking voice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as if I'm like responding
to chat and sure enough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they eventually just go away </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because that's what they want in the end. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> In the end they want you to
be like, how fucking dare you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> say something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're such an asshole. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, I already
worry too much about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I just stare at them,
do what they wanna do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but like a lot of streamers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> who are just starting off can't
really process that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're just buying into the bait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's hard to wrap your head around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that people are just gonna
do mean things to you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you don't know why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's nothing personal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's nothing personal,
people just do this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's sad that, that's
part of the job, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could like, there's someone
out there who I have no idea </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who they are, I have no
interaction with them ever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never spoken to
them and for some reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they just wanna see bad shit happen to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like that's really
difficult to accept that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a reality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause it takes you a few years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think to like actually accept that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Absolutely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know when I started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just kind of like getting
over it and just being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> all right, you know what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's gonna happen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like it was like
two, three years ago, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Probably when it happened enough times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you just kind of get used
to it and it's sad enough-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you can't do anything about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> You just gotta not let it ruin your day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You think about a logically, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Your being like, well
I've never interacted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> with this person, I don't know
what this person looks like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or what they're like as a person. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> They don't know what
they look like, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never interacted with them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So they're obviously
not saying all this shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> out of any logical basis. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So why would I take any logical basis </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> out of what they're saying? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's true, it's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess it was always to
be sad as long as I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> man if they actually just spoke to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure they'd pretty
see that I'm a nice guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and they wouldn't wanna do this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah, that's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Speaking of assholes online. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna quick rant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, go for it.
- Because I know we've talked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> about "Attack On Titan," like plenty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right, all right, here we go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Great start.
- Is it the weekly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Attack On Titan". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The weekly "Attack
On Titan" rant segment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm getting so fucking tired of spoilers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's gotten to the point now
where my enjoyment of this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is getting fucking ruined
because of spoilers online. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like logging on to Twitter now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> especially on a Monday, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like I'm trying not to be spoiled </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the "Attack On Titan." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like trying to go to
like a crowded hospital </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without a face mask and
expecting not to get Covid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like it's, I've been spoiled now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on so many plot points
of "Attack On Titan" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I feel like as someone
who likes to binge shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and as someone who doesn't wanna, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't wanna keep up with
it like weekly, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I feel like I'm being held at gunpoint </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just to keep up with this weekly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I feel you on that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You should go through the Wiki </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and get every character name </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you should mute them on Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I've done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've done that and yet still
I would be on a run for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It sips through the cracks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's no way to stop the cracks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and what I don't understand
is why is it that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when we talk about spoiler culture, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why is it that with a show
like "Attack On Titan" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's fine to talk about
it as soon as it airs? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's because everyone, all
the "Attack On Titan" fans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expect that everyone is watching it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as the episode comes out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because we have something
like the "Avengers." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So wait, so wait, you think
it's not okay to talk about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after it airs? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I think there
should be a buffer period. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like we have this for the "Avengers." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why can we not have this
for "Attack On Titan" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or any other TV show? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's your buffer period? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't remember. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, there was a
massive fucking buffer period </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where like the directors
and everyone was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Please do not talk about
the "Avengers End Game" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "for like a good two, three weeks." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there is just no buffer
period for like TV shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like, we're living in an
age where it's like on demand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's not even the same as it was before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where things are airing on TV </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and people are watching at the same time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's watching at different times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's literally an on demand service. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> the "Attack On Titan" manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that a good manga? </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I really like the community
aspect of when an episode airs, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone talks about
it, I kind of like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, but there're ways to talk about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in ways that are not
spoiling and there're places </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there're like open forums
that you have to physically go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and look up, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - When I talk about the show on Twitter, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I try not to mention spoilers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I know.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every tweet you've tweeted
about "Attack On Titan" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's fine because you're not spoiling it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but you still leave open
for discussion, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But there're some-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I still mute it right away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There're some fucking kids
who just do not understand that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, of course everyone is watching it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - (indistinct) 4K picture, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't believe this character died. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is like there's
like some motherfuckers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who will literally like put a full spoiler </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like put a spoiler warning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> five minutes after they just
spoiled with the fucking thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they talked about man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Right now, social media is
like setting a minefield. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've understood the
whole like spoiler warning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the beginning of a tweet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like, how about
you just don't tweet it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually it's I honestly not gonna lie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it saved me a few times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause I'll read the
top of it about a show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'll see a picture
and I'll quickly scroll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause I'm like, all right, sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's for the warning actually saved me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, to me, it's
just the most pointless </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking warning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's better than nothing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I would rather just you
not spoiling it to be honest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I understand, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause "Attack On Titan," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I wish I could tweet about
like the details of the show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a little bit more, but I know that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because I've like quite a large following </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm gonna have
spoil it up for someone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I don't wanna do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I literally like every time I-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I do think that if you
go on Twitter on a Monday </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in Japan and you haven't
watched the newest episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> honestly, that's kind of on you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, thanks for the
victim blame right there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So if you guys don't
know "Attack On Titan" airs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think in the evening in
America, but it airs like 5:00 a.m </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on a Monday for us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So first thing I do every
Monday when I wake up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is I watch the episode,
I don't open Twitter, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't do any cause I'm not being funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I know the internet,
they're gonna spoil it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's nothing you
can say here or ever do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that will stop them from doing that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so why not just watch it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel though that this
"Attack On Titan" incident </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like almost unprecedented. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I don't think
there's ever been an anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that has been where the
amount of spoilers on Twitter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has been this prelevant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's been none and I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because "Attack On Titan"
season three, part two, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought, I got spoiled on
some like minor things, but-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it that bad? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't see that many spoilers online. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I see so many. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I see it on Twitter trending page. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah!
- Oh! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like that's how you
know it's getting bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When literally when you go to
Twitter trending some weeks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I've seen it some weeks,
it's it shows you the tagline </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or the hashtag or
whatever word is trending </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then underneath gives the
spoiler and I'm like what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, that is a little scammy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, I can understand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's never happened
to any anime series. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That has never happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like recently I got, or like I knew like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the equivalent of being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yo, something's gonna
happen with this character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nine times out of 10,
it's probably a death. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's probably gonna be about death </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the problem is that "Attack On Titans" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is one of the easiest like
shows to spoil out there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause it only takes like
one sentence or one word. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm pretty sure I've
seen pictures of stuff, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> of like where the current manga is at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that like I'm sure that I
have seen very glimpse vicks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and when I see it and I
recognize a character, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, I skip, but I've seen it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I don't know what it is, so I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well, if they have no
context this picture, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what's going
on, I'm not gonna be spoiled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until the moment I see that frame. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, I actually disagree about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I disagree too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it's still like
spoils your experience a bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause there's been like for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's been so many, like,
let's say anime or manga </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or where you see like a meme panel, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this meme gets passed
around and you don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the context it, but then you finally read </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or watch whatever shows
everyone's memed about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it could be like this read, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some of the most serious
moments in like media </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has been like, just ruined for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I've seen the meme of
it and so the moment happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it takes you out and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, that was, that was
the moment they got memed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, right now I'm reading "Tokyo Ghoul" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I wanna see if the "Tokyo Ghoul" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> manga readers are right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I know when that fucking
Carnegie final comes up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna laugh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't know what
the context of it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Isn't that fun though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's fun?
- No, it is not fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's fun, that's fun, I had fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Biggest to me, like I've
had this happen where I-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not saying that
it's okay to post pictures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from the manga, I don't think anyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> should be fucking posting
pictures in the manga. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, but what I'm saying-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - People are still posting
pictures from the anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fresh after the anime just airs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What I'm saying though is
that people should just avoid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> posting it entirely
because even if, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You like read the spoiler
warning and you see the picture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like a fraction of a second, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, wait, just like no,
I'm not gonna watch it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Somewhere in the back of your head, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that image is subconsciously planted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, it is, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - But here's what I've realized, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When you see an image of a show, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That you're really into and
it's like it could be ages away, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you're making your own theory in your head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of why that image is happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you've seen it, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so most of the time
you're gonna be wrong, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not gonna be accurate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So are you technically spoiled? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because you've sort of seen something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's given you a vague
idea of what you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could be happening, but
you could be totally wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Are you spoiled that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I honestly want to come into a show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> with as least </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a zero expectations as I can.
- Me too, me too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But what I'm saying is that
like, if seeing one frame </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> of a panel of a manga and anime, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously if it's literally a
character dead on the floor, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, okay, that's very obvious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's being
heavily posted around, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, but if there's
a shot of something happening </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I can't quite make out, I
don't look at it long enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just have some kind of vague feeling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the back of my head. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't really think that's a spoiler </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because something
like that happened when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I decided to finally watch "Demon Slayer." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like the first
example we ever had at that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was when episode 19 was
trending on Twitter, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And everyone was posting
pictures and gifts of that scene. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And of course, because I knew immediately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the trending page, it says
"Demons Slayer" episode 19 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and at that point I hadn't
started here, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, wow,
eventually I wanna get to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So obviously I'm not gonna look at it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna try and avoid all pictures, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but obviously when you're on Twitter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or your on the internet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're gonna see like fraction of a frame </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or a fraction of an image, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And not gonna lie, when
I finally caught up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to "Demon Slayer" and I got
to that scene in episode 19, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, this is impressive, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I feel I would have
been even more impressed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if I had no idea that this was coming up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like everybody else, if
I'd not experienced it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does it take away? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - A little bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It does take away.
- To be honest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like it does absolutely take away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can understand that, but I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like this is epic, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but this could have been
fucking mind blowing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it was for everybody else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I mean, like I said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we we've thought about spoiler culture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when something as big as the "Avengers" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> was aired in cinemas. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, like "Game of Thrones." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hope to put that, but you can argue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that when it is such a big moment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in any media that obviously
it deserves to be talked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about the moment it happens
that you're like, oh my God </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> please tell me someone
else has watched this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> this is insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like it hasn't caught
up with the culture right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I could understand
that for example, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when things were airing on
TV, you had one run of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and people would go
around the water cooler </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and discuss what just happens,
but now, we're in a time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> when it's on demand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> People watch things when they want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and yet we still have the same like idea </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around spoiling things as if
people were watching things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on TV because I don't wanna watch things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> as soon as they are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I like binging it, hat's
just how I enjoy it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You should adapt to the way
that you can't on Twitter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is why I missed
like dedicated forums </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because with a dedicated
forum on a show, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You won't know anything
about the spoils of the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unless you decide to click on the forum. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, cause the way to
adapt is just like I said-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How do you solve this
problem on Twitter? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There is no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is never gonna go away, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so why not just adapt to what's happening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause you can't change it all the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> change with the time bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I don't wanna
fucking wait an entire week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for the next episode, I wanna binge it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, cause like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate watching shit weekly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The reason I said it was
because when this idea came up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the "Avengers," everyone
was like, yes, good, finally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> someone said it.
- That is bullshit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I saw people swirling it on Twitter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but probably not
nearly as much as without them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But the thing is--
- I don't think it mattered. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like everyone got
shamed for doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone was just like,
"Yo, you did a bad thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Don't fucking do this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, when we talk about TV shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and especially now with
the "Attack On Titan" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just everyone's
just doing it willy nilly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the mentality is,
well, everyone's doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I guess that's okay and
that's just acceptable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is such a hard topic to discuss. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I wish I had like more time to prepare </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like an actual rebuttal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I mean, I understand
where you're coming from. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just think that in
the age that we live in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> now, it's always gonna be like that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so why not just adapt to what's happening. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, I like for
me, I grew up watching anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and manga, I mean, I've gotten
used to just watching it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in a bubble, I like enjoying
like my entertainment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a bubble and it's only recently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I've gotten a different
kind of enjoyment to see, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like to discussing it with
friends and everything like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but when it's something that's, I mean-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - In a perfect world, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You'd go in a coma and you would wake up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the doctor's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Bro, here's your crunchy roll account. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Here's "Attack On Titan." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Don't get up yet, just
pretend you're still asleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Watch the rest of the
episodes and then leave </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "and then go on Twitter." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the perfect world, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where you can experience it,
full run, no breaks, no weeks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> no bullshit on Twitter, but
that's just not how it works. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I know it's not how it works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All I'm trying to argue
is that, why is it this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why is it like, why do people
not have a problem with this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think people do
have a problem with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're just kind of like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think especially in time like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can't do anything about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In times like now, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Where everyone's also
at home all the time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who you're gonna talk to? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Your mom about "Attack On Titan?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> No, you're gonna go on Twitter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and talk about with your friends
cause everyone's at home. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - But there's other venues to do that in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like isn't that the whole reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why fucking discord was invented? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just so you can create a private room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you know the people
you're discussing it with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - There are some people who, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> not me personally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They don't really talk about
stuff with their friends, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they just like to throw it
into a void, which is okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But people like that need to understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that no one gives a
shit about what you say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like what I'm trying to say
is if you want to discuss it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> why not discuss it on like
the relevant subs vitus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Probably where it belongs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, there's
a difference between </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> discussing spoilers in a
dedicated here are the episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> here's the episode, let's
just go on a thread versus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's just post screenshots
and stuff publicly on Twitter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that anyone can see. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the whole assumption that, yes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everybody who was a fan
of "Attack On Titan" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and anyone who had ever
search the "Attack On Titan" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is searching it because
they're watching it weekly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's that whole missed
assumption where it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's why, again,
like if you wanna discuss </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fucking episode that just happened, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> do it on a private discord server, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do it on a fucking subreddit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do it on a fucking closed forum. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What we need is spoiler etiquette. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We need a system in place
where everyone just agrees, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey, this is how you're gonna spoil it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, that's
all I was talking about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was talking about--
- That's never gonna happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's never gonna happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What I was trying to say is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's never gonna get to
a point where everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> follows this etiquette and everyone like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like a hard and fast
rule that everyone will follow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No, all I'm saying is like,
why is there no ethicacy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> around this where people were just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah, that would be--" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - There should be common sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's all also you gotta
think to the fact that okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 90% of people who were posting stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> aren't intending it so they ruin your day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's 10% of people who are hoping </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that they get people who they spoil. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They get enjoyment
knowing ruin someone's-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What I'm saying is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what it seemed around the "Avengers" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that it was that 10% of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that the only spoilers you got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> were people who are really looking to ruin </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other people's day, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But at least we can all
point to them and say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, they were an asshole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you wanted us to become
more of a normalized </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> asshole thing to put any-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fact that 90% of people
who were posting spoilers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> on Twitter about a "Tap On Time" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> aren't being called out for
it, I think it's the problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you think it's,
I mean cause the anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is arguably more popular than the manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's a little
dickish people to post panels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from the manga when you
can just talk about them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> not post them to Twitter when,
you know that the majority </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the people are anime only. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right.
- Right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That kind of annoys me cause
that makes sense to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - But even still just,
just keep it privately bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I get it posting the
anime cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> all right, everyone's watching the anime-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I found it a real problem
where the last time I stream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> literally the first
thing I had to say was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't ask me questions
about that "Tap One Time" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because of the fact that
people will like type to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in the chat immediately, like five minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> into me streaming binge, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Hey Joey, what are your
thoughts on the "Tap One Time?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, I'm not gonna
fucking talk about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause why would you assume
that I've caught up to it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why would you assume everyone in this chat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has caught up to it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not gonna do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So to avoid spoilers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> let's just not fucking
talk about it at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the best way to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You wanna talk about
it, do it in your own </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking DMs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean like it's a
different conversation to say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how much spoilers do ruin
a show or ruin something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, that's a different conversation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a good conversation going. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just wish there was
some basic etiquette. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what I mentioned
earlier about the picture, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that when you see a picture
or a frame or an image </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> from an anime, you're like, oh man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wonder what that's all about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Why has Conoci thrown his head back? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why he been doing that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I kind of think it's pretty
cool when you have an idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of why this is happening
and that it's totally wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, oh, that's how it happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought this was gonna happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I kind of liked that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's kind of cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Not that I want, please don't do this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but sometimes when it happens,
you don't feel too spoiled </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but I feel it's a
bit of a different story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the Conoci thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it's like in the manga
that's a really serious scene </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and all I can imagine is (indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> That's all that is playing in
the back of my head, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But like in the funny way, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it really does kind of like,
it's not so much a spoiler, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just kind of like the
gap between what you expected </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and what actually happened is
like a disappointment, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause I feel like it really
much depends on the show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause like, for example, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think it's physically
possible to spoil with Jojo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's not, you can post a panel, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you can fully explain what's
happening in the scene </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it won't prepare you for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah yeah, exactly.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember that time that
limp dick fought biscuit soup </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and they kissed each other
to death and you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, is that spoiler? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, I mean, yeah (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, to her I know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> That is how the fight ends. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but like something like Jojo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it doesn't hurt your
enjoyment of the series. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Part of that is the
enjoyment of the series. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, it pretty makes it better </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> if someone explains
what's happening to you-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You totally understand it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, you're like, oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But a character dying
in "Attack On Titan," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anyone can understand
that and it ruins it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's a minefield right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just wanted to go on a quick
first world problem rant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This isn't actually an important problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just wanted to go in an off Titan rant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah and the spoiler culture
is pretty fun to talk about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Just discuss it, what's
going on with that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because like,
have you ever been spoiled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like any big plot points
that has kind of ruined </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your enjoyment of every, any show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> or you think you would like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm amazed at some shows
that I didn't get spoiled, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like with certain plot
points in "Attack On Titan," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I am like, how the fuck did
I not get spoiled on this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This shit was so goddamn obvious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that everyone was pretty talking about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm the only idiot that didn't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, obviously I won't say it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But there're moments. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> In recent memory, I can't
remember last time I got spoiled. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got spoiled on the
"Code Geass" ending. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh!
- Oh no! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is why I'm so fucking
passionate about this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - My condolences man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is why I'm so
fucking passionate about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I didn't even finish season one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I got spoiled on that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How did you get spoiled? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> What happened? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I was on some
forum where they were talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about "Code Geass" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I didn't realize that,
oh there's a second season </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of "Code Geass" and
people were talking about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, so the last three
episodes of season two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "was like, that was a crazy ending." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Was it?
I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is there's two seasons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can talk about the "Code
Geass" ending now, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like Bruce Willis at the
end of, everyone knows it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think my buffer is like 10 years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like everyone has seen it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You can spoil it, it's
common knowledge, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe we shouldn't be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> cause otherwise it will sound
really fucking hypocritical. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Once enough time has passed
and a show is iconic enough, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it is totally
fair game to talk about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause it's part of pop
culture at that point, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but the cookie you're
sending is universally loved </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and often cited as one of
the best endings in anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You should know how it ends. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - To me though, like that buffer
is still too small, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I can go ahead </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and spoil like something
like, "Soylent Green" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause that's like a
60-year-old movie, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, I feel "Code Geass" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like they're still
kids today coming in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably having no idea what
the show is about, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I don't want, look,
I've been through the pain, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> especially with "Code Geass," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I'm not gonna say shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, like I
got spoiled on something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of a similar capacity I'd say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I got spoiled on like the
halfway point of "Death Note" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where saw something big happens. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I was a manga spoiler as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the worst. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the worst. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel that's worse than
getting spoiled on the ending </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of "Death Note." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is worse than getting spoiled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on the ending of "Death Note." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's worse than
getting spoiled for in the end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause that was the ending
of "Death Note" for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So that's, you talk about that, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That's so iconic, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like there's some things in anime like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like I need to
like make a survey of this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, depending on the survey results </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is whether I can spoil it or not, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like dude 90% of
people who know me know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the halfway point of "Death Note?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like saying like fucking
Walter White makes meth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like yeah, that's universally no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Come on.
- It's not even close. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I just think
that after a certain point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where something is so well
loved and so well-known </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so universally like
watched by everyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> instead of community, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that it is fair to just openly discuss it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - By the way, please
don't spoil "Code Geass" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and "Death Note" in the
comments of this episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's been how many
years since "Death Note," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is like what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 13? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, played early 2000s, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 2006.
- Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Code Geass" was 2007, I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's been a lot of time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not gonna do it just in case, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think that it should be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's your buffer? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> What's your buffer? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I'm an anime fan, I would be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the first thing I'd be like,
what do you think of that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Think of that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow, you really just said that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - There're some things, if
you say you are like a fan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of egg genre that you should know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like if you're like, I
love Bruce Willis movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you should know that he's dead
in "The Sixth Sense," right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone knows, that's
like the meme spoiler. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's just spoil all
the B plot twist of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but no, no, I get it, I get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's that's like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Making me out to be the fucking bad guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, I mean, I get it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> cause that's become
like part of pop culture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now I would say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly, it's
not the show anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> The twist is so iconic that the twist-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Has become part of pop culture itself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> rather than watching the shows. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've never seen "The Sixth
Sense," but I know the twist </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because everyone's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause it's always used
as like anecdotally like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh it's like the ending. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck, I haven't watched it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not gonna watch it now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you really not gonna watch it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's still a really good movie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm pretty gonna watch it at some point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, it's a little good movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because like,
I feel like right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> how would you feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> if someone's spoiled
"Attack On Titan" for you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I'd be crushed
and I'd get over it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Would you get over it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I was not over when I
got spoiled for "Code Geass." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It depends, what, how bad of a spoiler </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're talking, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm talking like ending of "Code Geass" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> levels of spoilers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the ending of "Attack On Titan." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Someone spoiled the ending
of "Attack On Titan" for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It depends what it was, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause if I already feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's going in a certain
direction right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and if the film was like
confirmed that it was going there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd be like, kind of sucks that
you confirmed my suspicion, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'll get over it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Would you though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, cause I've
been spoiled on stuff before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I've been like, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> At the end of the day, the
experience is still a banger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and this ain't gonna ruin it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, look, yeah, like granted, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I finished "Code Geaas" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and even after knowing that spoiler. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It doesn't spoil it, it
doesn't ruin it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> The scene's so goddamn good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It didn't ruin it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm thinking of like
the what if scenario </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of if I wasn't spoiled, like
how much of a mind factor-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - If the scene is so
reliant on the fact that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like don't need to know this plot point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that like the emotions, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the voice act in the music, the animation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but all of that can't bring
in like an emotional reaction </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of you, then I don't think it deserves </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like guarded in the first place. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - But at the same time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like it took
something away from you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It took that fresh experience from you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they're like, there are shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I've re-watched "Code Geass," right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Fucking the ending is excellent
every time out of none, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the like by far, the
most unique experience I had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was that first time that holy shit moment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I experienced it for the first time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you can only get that once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I'm just trying
to be positive here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Should I say if it gets spoiled man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> don't watch at the end of
the world, you gonna be okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The scene's still good,
it holds up, don't worry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, there are even
shows where you enjoy more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the second time you watch it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but I still value having
that first fresh experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I don't know what's gonna happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's that first
moment that's so strong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you look back on it years later </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like it's that obligatory like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I wish I could erase my mind about X show, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I could experience it all over again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that, to me, that was "Code Geass." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I was like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably because you
don't re-watch shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is why you don't care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Your taking one, you've
put in a zip folder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you file it away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Compress that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You compress that shit and
then you throw it in the trash. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not really (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think that I'm in like
the middle of like, I care, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't really care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's not gonna take
away my, if the show's good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm still gonna enjoy it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I definitely feel that
most people are on the end of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't want anything spoiled for me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't tell me anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I want like the full on experience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't want someone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, I'd rather fall on the experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> than someone just paraphrasing
it to me in a shit way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm tired as fuck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so we're gonna end this episode right now. </SPEAKER_05>
