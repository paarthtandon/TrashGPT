<SPEAKER_05> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey groans) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Trash Taste.
(Connor groans) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (relaxing music) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Hello, you fabulous fun bags. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Welcome back to another episode </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of Trash Taste podcast.
- Oh, god. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh my god.
- Oh my god. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm fun bag number one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with fun bag number two and three. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Are you filling fun today, Joey? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm feeling super fun today. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I gotta say, you kinda look
like fucking Rocky Balboa </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> about to run up those steps right now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey screams) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is a very sports-like jumper. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - It does look like the
stereotypical I'm about to montage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I walked in the office and
Meilyne called me a fuck boy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know if I appreciated that or not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's because you have
short hair and a beanie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the short hair, beanie,
and the rings, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You shaved your facial hair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, we all did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, we all did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - For the charity stream
that we just finished. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - People are gonna be like,
oh my god, this episode's so, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> they recorded this so long ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know. (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Really dating ourselves. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We're like, yeah, we just
recorded the charity stream, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which was probably- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - For you guys was like a month ago. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> For us, it was two days ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think it was a month
and a half ago, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Oh, more than that, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, we're trying to get ahead </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> before we fly off once again. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - But yeah, if you guys
didn't know about it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we just finished a 24-hour charity stream </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for Doctors Without Borders, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was extremely successful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I was very surprised. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We raised 176, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> but we haven't added the amounts- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's about 180, I think, total. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - About 180, adding everything
that we collected in total. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's crazy.
- That's nuts. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is absolutely fucking nuts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know what we expected
out of this charity stream. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - There was a part of me
when we were deciding, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay, what are we gonna make our goal? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And someone was like 100,000. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, in 24, that's
a lot of money, dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, maybe if we are like doing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> a week-long subathon maybe. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, or something like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I don't know, I only
did one charity stream once, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> years and years ago with Aki, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we did not raise
nearly that much money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I think, in the back of my head,
I had that as my benchmark. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So when I heard a 100,000, I was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> dude, we're not fucking
PewDiePie or Jacksepticeye. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We're not gonna hit those numbers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Turns out, we kinda did,
because we were number one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> on Twitch for that night. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Which was nuts.
- Yeah, yeah, I mean, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I think we peaked at 53,000
viewers, which is insane. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - PB.
- Quite a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, personal best, personal best. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Quite a lot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> That's definitely the most
I've been involved in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's definitely the most I've had, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Definitely by far. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, I'm not even the streamer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> So that's definitely the
most I've been a part of. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it's just ridiculous. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - But how was the experience for you boys? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Even though I went into
it with zero sleep, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it was probably the most fun
stream I've ever been in. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I would absolutely do that again. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Part of me is just like, I
would absolutely do that again. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> And part of me is-
- Not anytime soon. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, a part of me is just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> man, I remember those
last six hours, that was- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll do it again once
I forget about how hard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the last six hours were. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, yeah, this is
fine, we can do this again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, at least I had you
guys and Chris and Mouse there, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because, if I had done it by myself, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would not have lasted 10 hours. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I remember the last two, three hours. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was just running on complete autopilot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> You know when you're just
using the part of your brain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that isn't even thinking? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like habits you've built up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> That was just me, I was just like- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I saw bits and pieces of the board </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it's just you alone on the couch, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're just like, "Thank
you for the $20 donation." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - It kind of got to a point </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where I was just
questioning my own insanity. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it was just-
- Is that sanity really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Sanity? Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Or insanity? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I questioned my own sanity. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Questioned my own sanity. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - My favorite clip though
is where you two were </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> on the couch and you just started going, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Well, let's have all the boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, let's have all the boys." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they Garnt, in the most
unenthusiastic way, goes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "Get hype, guys." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like the most
not-hype "Get hype, guys" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I've ever heard. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just had such house party vibes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like when you stay up too late, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's that one guy
that just wouldn't leave. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that was exactly
what it felt like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> where I'm just like, I need to go to bed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Garnt is that one guy who doesn't leave. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you are, you are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> At every fucking all-night
karaoke, Garnt is the last guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, I was the last
guy in the stream as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm just like, you boys... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, this wasn't the
competition obviously, obviously, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I was the only one to
stay awake the entire time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know, I know, I know.
- Right, right, right, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - If it was Connor that
was in your position, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> he would've been like,
"Weak, you're all weak. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I won that competition." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Absolutely.
- It was me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I carried. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think, 'cause I knew
you guys were there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was like, so I can sleep. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Then I was like, I will. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I think if it was just
me alone, I would've had to, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I would have just ducked out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah, of course, of course. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And just been more miserable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, the reason I didn't sleep </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was because I knew as
soon as I closed my eyes, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they were not going... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I could not go to sleep and
come back up to stream again. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I couldn't stop yawning. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I just looked horrible. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember the last 30
minutes when I came back, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I looked half dead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, oh god. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I used all my
energy holding in the laughs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I used an exceptional </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amount of energy.
- I used so much energy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not saying anything during
the try-not-to-laugh segment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> That took a lot more energy
than I thought it did. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It actually took more
energy than doing the quiz, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> talking, or just hanging out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Also not to mention that I
think we greatly overestimated </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> how much energy we were going to have, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> because we had a schedule, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a preemptive schedule that staff made. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And we probably did maybe 40% </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of what was originally scheduled. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I mean-
- 50. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was a few things, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause obviously Chris was
scheduled for two hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Stayed for six hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which I'm not complaining,
I'm not complaining. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was obviously having fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But then we also had a bunch of things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we were meant to
be doing with Ironmouse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But by the time Chris
left and Mouse came on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was just, we were so out of energy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we were just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we can only manage talking right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - How did you guys manage
to recover afterwards? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Did you recover easily? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, recover is a strong word. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I went home, and weirdly enough, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I think because I was
kinda reliving the moment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I was on the train ride home. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So by the time I got home, I
was wide awake for some reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I was doing a little bit of work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and then my body was just
like, I don't think so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I literally passed out on my desk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my god.
- For like an hour. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was just like, (sniffling). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, I need to go to bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> And then I slept for
like 14 hours, I think. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And then I just completely fucked </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> my sleep schedule for the next day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> My body's so weird after an all-nighter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate it, I absolutely fucking hate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause, during the stream, I'm
like, I'm going to pass out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's well documented how
close we were to passing out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And so I remember, the stream finishes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I do not even remember saying goodbye </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to anyone in the office,
even though I know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we were all just like,
"Hey, congratulations!" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they were like, "See you on Tuesday. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> See you in like two days or whatever." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I said, "See you on Tuesday," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think I just left as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if it seemed
like I was rude or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need to go to my bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're so rude, Garnt. You're so rude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember like-
- Such a diva. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember going to my
bed, being like, finally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've stayed up all night for this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Didn't nap, didn't sleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going to finally go to sleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Get on my bed, and my body's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nope, you don't sleep now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You stay awake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't need sleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is sunshine now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So how long did you stay awake till? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I stay up for an extra... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It took me three hours to get
to a point where I could sleep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I slept for-
- So what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like 3:00 PM, 4:00 PM? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that was around when I passed out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I slept for two hours. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - So I was just, my day
was just fucked, I guess. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - When did you go to bed bed then? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like 2:00 in the morning. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my god.
- Oh my god. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - But then I did sleep for
like 16 hours, so that's- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, so you woke up at
like 4:00 PM the next day? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my god, Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's why I woke up to
Connor streaming "Jump King," </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like, fuck's sake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> How are these boys awake
and streaming right now? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm fighting for my life. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - On Sunday, I went home and
then I had three hours sleep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I went out for
some drinks and a meal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How the fuck? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was fine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - How?
- How? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I got tired at around 10:00 PM. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I went home and then I slept, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> woke up early, and played "Jump King." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> But I finished it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You finished it, yeah, congrats. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> You've both finished it now.
- So did I. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I finally finished
"Babe of the Ascension," </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which is the worst thing ever. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't ever wanna do it ever again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Finally finished the base
game, that was fun for- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - When you gonna do the DLC, Joey? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know what sucks? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> At the end of that stream, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't pay me to play the DLC. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want my happiness back in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then the moment I
turned off the stream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, fuck, I wanna keep playing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because you're
like, but there's more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because it was the fact </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that there was so much
encouragement online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I posted my time
and people were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Dude, you're actually cracked." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Maybe I am. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Maybe I am. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Give me a little more praise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, come on.
- Give me more praise. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - The game has a way of humbling you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I thought the same
thing when I did the third DLC, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, I'm cracked, dude. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'll be able to do this new one easily. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was actually worried. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, what if I
beat this DLC too fast? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Too fast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's like not a good stream arc. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then the first
eight hours of playing it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, oh no, oh no, this is hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> This is really hard. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it too me 48 hours- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Damn.
- To beat the DLC. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - 48 hours.
- The fan-made DLC. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But now I know what it feels
like to be an alpha gamer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And now I can finally say, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hey, Garnt, when are you
finishing "Jump King," bro? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, when are you gonna do "Jump King?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll do it, guys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I fucking feel like fucking that scene </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> in fucking "My Hero Academia", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like All Might is
just pointing at you saying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "It's your turn now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's your turn.
- Fuck's sake, All Might. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You gotta do it, you gotta do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just here watching on TV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not even involved and
here you are pointing at me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> being like, "It's your turn." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You've done half of it, so
you have to do the other half. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is it half of it? Is it half of it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, Garnt got to maybe 40%. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I got 40%.
- Where did you get to? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I can't remember. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - He got to the fucking- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] The poles? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, not even there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Before that, the town in the sky. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bargainburg. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bargainburg, that's it,
he got to Bargainburg. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, I will finish it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just because I knew it's one
thing, when I started it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was just like it's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have the same inkling feeling in me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where it doesn't feel
comfortable until I finish it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Taking your time, aren't you, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's been a few weeks
since your last one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're gonna get rusty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You'll start from zero again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll be fine, I'll be fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It'll be like pure muscle memory. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It'd be like you never left. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's gonna be like
dementia the game with Garnt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Every time he goes back to it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he's like, oh, I gotta
learn this section again. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - It'll be like 30... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> My playthrough will be
like 50 hours or something </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> spread between an entire year.
- Look, if anything, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you now have someone else
to compare yourself to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's Meilyne, because
she also started it as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That stream last night was hilarious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - I saw Mudan started it as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, Mudan started it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Jesus Christ, it's like a virus. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - But don't worry, if you thought... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Look, Meilyne just got to
the bottom of the sewers, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it took her a couple
of hours to get there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just think it's one of
the best games to stream. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so intuitive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no explanation needed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, some games there's
like power-ups, level ups. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then there's like, oh,
you can unlock this thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and then everyone's like,
oh, what's going on? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But "Jump King" is literally just- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - One mechanic.
- You can see. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - You jump, one button. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You understand immediately from watching </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that they're trying to go
up, and when they fall, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like, oh, I get
it, this is fun to watch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's also just a pretty game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's good, right?
- It's a really pretty game. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I love the aesthetic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I will say, I thought you were
bullshitting when you said, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, it's a fun game, it's a fun game." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But no, it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I do actually genuinely
think it's a fun game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a high that you get when you reach </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your new personal best. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, damn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey panting) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> This is a good feeling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then that lasts for like three seconds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before you fall for the first time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, aw. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know we've spoke
on "Jump King" so much </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> on this podcast now, 'cause
it's like taken over my life, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but on the first map, there's
a very solid checkpoint. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When you get to that, you
feel like, I can do this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The 70% one, right? Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, when you get to the- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The church? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The church.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then you're like,
oh my god, I can do this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's when it feels good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's when I was like,
all right, I got this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You got this, king. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, you can do it then. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If you can get there,
you can do it easily. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So DLC for me is a hard maybe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, you should do it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think I want to maybe put
in a couple of other games </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> that I've been wanting to play. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hard maybe. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What does that even mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a hard maybe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - What were you, being like- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey won't ever commit to anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So maybe is about the
best you'll get from Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it's better than "Arcania," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> where he just will flat out say no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] A hard maybe. (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - A hard maybe is like a- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I am committed to my neutrality here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It could be yes, it could be no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Do you want to marry the bride? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you wanna marry the bride?
- I am firmly planted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a hard maybe, dog. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's a hard maybe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - My ass is firmly planted on the fence. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was your viewership higher than normal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> when you were doing "Jump King?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But you know, it's like,
what do I prioritize, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> clout or happiness? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a hard choice for every YouTuber. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can have both. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm just waiting for when
the Kirby game comes out, dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That's when real happiness comes out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I play games now, when
I play "Pokemon: Arceus," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> there's just not enough challenge. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Even though there was,
there literally was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There definitely was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But the thing was is
that I never once thought, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> for a moment, I wasn't
gonna be able to do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Whereas "Jump King" has
that thing where it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if you can do it, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait, but you did
that last fight, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - The Volo, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, and you
struggled a lot with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I did, but, at no point,
did I ever feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is too hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because to me, that was easily </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the hardest in-game Pokemon fight ever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is, it is, it is, but even then, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> there's no point, when I'm doing it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> where I'm like, I don't
know if I can do this, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I just felt like I just gotta
grind a little bit more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've gotta admit,
Arceus was hard as fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, yeah, that one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wanna see you do that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Whereas New Babe+, when
I was playing that game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of "Jump King," it's the second map, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did it over three streams. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One stream, second stream, third stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The second stream after it and
I went to bed, I had anxiety. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, what if I just can't do it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Just can't do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What if I can't do it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm never gonna be able to
forget this if I can't do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I woke up the next
day and just bossed it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> just destroyed it in one hour. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Damn. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think you have an addiction. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] There's definitely
an addiction, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I kind of got out of multiplayer games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That was kinda where I got the kick from, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beating other people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a hard ceiling
in multiplayer games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> if I wanna be able to
to improve at this game, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I have to put an absurd amount
of hours in consistently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait, but is 45 hours
in one "Jump King" map </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> not an absurd amount of time? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - What is a lot of time? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You could finish 13
Sentinels in that time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Think about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> An FPS first-person shooter
multiplayer game, whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 45 hours is nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true.
- That's absolutely nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're competing against
people who do 45 hours a week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How many hours have you put into all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> of "Jump King" right now? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - 100-something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's quite a lot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> That's a "Persona" playthrough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's a "Persona" playthrough. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - In "Apex," I have over 1,000 probably. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, that's true.
- That's true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And even then, I got to master once, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and that was me going insane grinding it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, why don't you get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in some more challenging games then? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause you said you don't really play </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> the "Souls" types games
or that kinda genre. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm gonna do "Elden Ring." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like it's a
different type of challenge, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because, with "Jump King,"
it's just one mechanic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you have to hone-
- Master. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And master, whereas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with something like
"Elden Ring" or "Sifu," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a lot of things going on at once. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a lot of different approaches, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of ways to master the game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I just like "Jump King,"
'cause there's no bullshit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> If you fucked up, absolutely nothing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's no other single factor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because with games
like "Dark Souls" or "Sifu"- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] There's some
bullshit that can happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, you can
blame it on the enemy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck? That one frame hit me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know I'll make up excuses. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But in "Jump King," there's
no enemies to get in your way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just you. You're
in the way of yourself. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You are your own enemy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Almost like fucking- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Don't trust anyone, not even yourself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That is "Jump King." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Each DLC gets more brutal though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The first "Jump King," you
can only fall two screens max. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what I'm dreading, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I fell 20 in the latest one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What if I actually start raging? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't want that though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't wanna get angry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not like an actual angry though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like an angry video-game angry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a different kinda anger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how to explain it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's an anger where you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you shout, but it doesn't
actually get you upset. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're just kinda like, (screams). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> All right, back to it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like a slight
frustration, slight annoyance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like stubbing your toe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, no, there's different
kinds of video game... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what that analogy was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm not angry when I stub my toe. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not like a 13-year-old
on Xbox Live angry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I just test out all the
new bad words I've learned, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not that kinda anger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just from out of frustration, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when the website, when
you fill out the whole form, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then it reloads for some reason. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, (screams). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Really? That's the anger you feel? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude, when you enter a... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have you not had that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I get so angry when that happens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You've filled out a whole signup form, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> put the credit card
info in, the address in, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all in the right space. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You're about to go to the checkout. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> For some reason- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] It times out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it times out, or it reloads. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Fucking Guts' theme goes through my head. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, is it even
worth signing up again? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know if this is worth it anymore. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even want the trampoline. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - The worst part is when you
fill out everything correctly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> except for that one field, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but the website's designed in a way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that when you press send, it goes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this one field is incorrect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've reset the whole thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But they've reset the
entire fucking thing- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, dude.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's the level of anger.
- Except for that one field. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, I hate that.
- Imagine that happens, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> but it happens to every
website you sign up for. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - There's so many Japanese
websites like that as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Every Japanese website, dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know if Japanese people
are aware of UX designers, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but they certainly need some more. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - The amount of times
I've been fucking cucked </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> by not using half-width Katakana. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> My fucking god, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is the biggest joke in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's something you'll never experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> unless you either try to buy
stuff in on a Japanese website, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but, for some reason, they have full-width </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and half-width Katakana and Hiragana. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Can you explain that by the way? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> What is the point of full
width and half width? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll tell you exactly the difference. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There is none. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's what's so frustrating about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Someone explained it to me one time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It had something to do with
how they coded way back, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> the initial internet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Here in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it was a layover of that essentially </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that they just kept using.
- Probably. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they never decided to sort out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean, I've told the story </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> of how I interned for an IT company here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I got to fix a bunch
of clients' websites. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I had to go through the HTML, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and I almost had a stroke
looking at some of these codes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's like, oh my god, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you said you built this website last year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're using code literally from the '90s. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Of course this page
takes 20 seconds to load </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> even though it's just text based, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because there's so much
bullshit code here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so weird-
- It's the worst. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause it's almost like convenient stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and crazy stuff you can do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can't do in other countries. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then they're like,
how about websites? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> We just keep them shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We just keep them shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Weirdly enough, the
best designed websites </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> are the fucking anime trailer websites. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, the ones that are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they use fucking pretty Java and CSS. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, oh, that looks fancy as fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, when that website </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> of when the last "Bakemonogatari"
volume was coming out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was just scrolling down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the entire history of the series, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I was like, damn, this is
beautiful-looking website. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my god, an actual coder, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> an actual programmer made this, dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why can you not add
this to your UI design </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I'm trying to fucking buy something? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Exactly.
- Or sign up to a site? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Rakuten is just a hellhole of a website, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because you don't know, you go to... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause on Amazon, for example- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You see why Amazon's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They don't do this shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because on Amazon, it's like, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's the fucking picture
of the thing you wanna buy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's how many is left,
when it's gonna arrive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Here's all the information. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everything is perfectly laid
out with every single item. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Meanwhile, with Rakuten, it's
just a fucking free for all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, would you like 17
banners that have nothing to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the product you're actually buying? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> By the way, where is the purchase button? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, it's buried deep beneath
this fucking wall of text. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And every time I go onto
Rakuten, it's so handy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you get so much stuff on Rakuten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can't get on Amazon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's just a struggle
to try and buy anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> because it doesn't even
tell you when it arrives. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, no, that's not the final boss. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The final boss is Yahoo! Auctions. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah, Yahoo! Auctions.
(Joey groans) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where you can't even sign up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with an account that you want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> You need a special Yahoo! account. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So you need to just sign up to Yahoo! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's not your normal Yahoo! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's Japanese Yahoo! as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I have a Yahoo! email account, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> some Duncan or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know, they chose the name for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's really weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course it's a Yahoo! Japan account, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because no one outside of Japan
uses fucking Yahoo! anymore. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Exactly, right, exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So you just need to just sign up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with a special Yahoo! account </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to sign up to this Yahoo! Auctions account </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to then just not even, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't even know what the etiquette is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> in terms of bidding stuff
and how to buy stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dude, I dead ass never
even used Yahoo! Auctions </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just because I refuse to
make a Yahoo! Japan account. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have a bad rating on it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I forgot one time
to say I got the thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got that on Mercari as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got a really angry message
from a dude who was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Why haven't you told me that you got it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This has been an awful experience for me." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, I just figured
if I didn't say anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that means I got it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, you'd think so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But how'd you pay? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Can you pay with credit card or something? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so it's really confusing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When you auto-translate it
in Google, there's online pay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and something else that
sounds like online pay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I remember that I was confused, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I clicked one of them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I had to do this
whole weird kind of thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with my bank where I had
to then contact my bank </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to do the online payment. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Oh my god. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where there was just another field </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that just let you put your
credit card information in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It isn't clear, 'cause it
didn't say credit card. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It said something else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Really annoying, really, really annoying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hate using it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just don't bother. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why I mean, as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of the websites that
offer English, they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> okay, you click English, send
you to a brand new website </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that doesn't have half the
shit of the Japanese one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Whereas Amazon, it's
like, you change to English, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> nothing changes except the language. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- It's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's exactly like when you
go to a Chinese restaurant </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> with your one Chinese mate, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're like, bring
on the special food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bring on the real menu.
- Real menu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know why it's Chinese
restaurants in particular, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it seems like every
Chinese restaurant has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> the special menu that you can only get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> by asking in Cantonese
or Mandarin or whatever. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I bet they're not even
saying bring out the real menu. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's probably just like
a codeword, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, mandarin is an orange. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, he said the word. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> All right, bring it out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It just plays with my mind, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I go to a Thai restaurant, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and I can ask them in Thai
whether they have a Thai dish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they only do in Thailand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or only most Thai people would know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is it that Chinese
restaurants just have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> an unspoken understanding </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> that there's gonna be
so many people asking </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for a special menu that they're
gonna make a special menu </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> in every single Chinese restaurant? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why are they literally gatekeeping? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like they're literally gatekeeping, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> being like, if you're not Chinese, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can't get the real shit, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It makes me feel sad though,
'cause I love Chinese food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I never wanna go to a Chinese restaurant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> without a Chinese friend. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I know, right?
- Yeah, I know, it sucks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - 'Cause it feels like you
just unlocked the starter, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the starter kit, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And you need to learn Mandarin
to get the actual good gear. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause I love Chinese food, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> but the best Chinese food I've had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has not come from the normal menu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I go to a Chinese restaurant, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I see fucking orange chicken, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sweet and sour chicken,
fried rice, all this stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, no, no, give me the real shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Please give me the real shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how to access it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where is your Chinese friend, huh? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do not know how to access it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't see him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just speak Chinese for it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Just speak Mandarin.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's easy, it's easy.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Could you imagine if McDonald's did that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, oh, where is
your American friend? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, I know Shake Shack does though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do they? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they have secret items. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You didn't know this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No, it's not Shake Shack, sorry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> In-N-Out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - In-N-Out.
- Oh, In-N-Out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, I don't go to
In-N-Out, so that's fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - What possible special
menu could they provide? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can get the... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, I don't know,
it's animal style fries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's a secret menu item. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah, yeah, I know that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then there's a- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is that a secret menu though? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel that's so well known now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but if you're a tourist from Asia </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> who doesn't speak English- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Oh, that's true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And you're like, what's that guy got? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck? How do I get that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No one told-
- I'll never tell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know you can get a flavor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> where they mix all the
milkshake flavors into one, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which sounds interesting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It sounds interesting, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know if you want that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think there's something else. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> There's another secret
burger or something as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I know there are secret
items at fast food chains. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - There are secret items. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Items on the menu.
- Where would there be secret- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Not like an entire- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know that- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because they're a
pain in the ass to make, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but if someone asks for it- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is it a marketing thing, you reckon? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Also that as well, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It makes you seem like you're- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - In the club.
- In a club. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Part of the secret society. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I got the real stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Give me the real stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you ever been to those places </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that are secret bars or clubs or anything? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, like the invite-only ones? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You ever been to those? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, one of my friends took
me to one where it literally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm obviously not gonna say
where, but it literally- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'll never tell. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'll never tell. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'll never tell. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've been there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It literally looks like a concrete wall. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I was with my friend, and
he's like, "Okay, we're here." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "What do you mean?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's in Roppongi somewhere, I think? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause we went to one in Shibuya, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, that speakeasy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - It said closed, and it
was closed due to corona. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Someone knocked on the
door, and they came out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It wasn't even it looked closed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It was just scaffolding, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and a wooden door.
- Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like the place was being
built and boarded off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you just knock on the door. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And like an actual speakeasy, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the fucking thing opens up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, my one had that
as well, so he knocked. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He's like, "Oh, I have to
knock a specific way as well." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, "Bullshit you do." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he did a secret pattern. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the thing came up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was like, "Password."
(speaking in foreign language) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he said the password. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was like, "Friend?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He pointed at me, and he's
like, "Yeah, yeah, friend." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he opens it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's just this tiny
maybe three-person bar. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was all right, I guess. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was all right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was cool that I was in there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The coolest part was just going </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> to what looked like a secret bar. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - The coolest part was
just the dude opening </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it up like this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I've only ever seen that in movies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I went to one where, it was in London. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I went to it, and it was
a breakfast restaurant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something on the top. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We went in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I didn't know the password, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and neither did my friend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then we were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "We don't know what the password is." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was like, "It's
a Daft Punk song lyric." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was feeding it-
- He was giving clues! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He was feeding it to
me, and I was like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was something like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm up all night to
get lucky or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - So he said it, then he was like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not even an obscure Daft Punk song. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You just go through
their entire discography. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah, which album? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which album are we talking about? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay, okay, can't be too many lyrics. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If it's Daft Punk lyrics,
that narrows it down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it "Around the World?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So then we're here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then some guy comes and greets us, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and we start walking through
this restaurant that's closed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then, like in a movie,
we go in the kitchen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's people
working into the kitchen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're just walking through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their working in the kitchen.
- Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we go down into a
basement in the kitchen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's boxes of fries
and shit all around us, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and we're going in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like in a fucking spy movie,
it's got the fucking beads. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, shit!
- For the door. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And it opens it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There's this room, I mean, it's fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Like a dimly lit room? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's okay, but there's
no real chairs or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's kinda like a very small
room that's very dimly lit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It wasn't that good, and
the drinks were okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> The coolest part was
walking to this thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And then I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> now I wanna leave. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've always wanted to know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Why would you opt to make
a business like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Novelty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel clearly if you're
going to opt to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, I'm gonna make this so exclusive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's near impossible
for a regular person to find. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Then it's like you're clearly not doing it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> as a sustainable business. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You're clearly just doing it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> as a fucking hobby or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - The assumption is
you'll be able to survive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on word of mouth, I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the hope. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A lot of people are like,
"It's so cool, you gotta go." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> And then the drinks are very mediocre. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> But the experience feels worth it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause you feel exclusive. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but it's just
bragging rights, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you pay for the experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and not so much the bar or the business </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or the drinks itself. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like bars that are membership only. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And you can only get membership </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by having someone recommend you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That always seemed really silly to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But there's so many of them in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's like half of the
Golden Guy membership. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, half of Nichome, as
well, is like that as well, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it's like, if you don't someone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who either works there or
goes there frequently enough, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they just won't let you in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, but at the same time, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I get it with the bars in Golden Guy, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because the bars are so small </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm sure that their regular customers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can keep their business
up and running anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just need one or two patrons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So you get yourself going,
and then you're basically set. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's true.
- That's true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're basically set. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It'd be really cool to own </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a tiny little bar in Golden Guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I've always thought about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How hard is it to get a bar there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's what I've always wondered. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> All those bars, even
though they're so tiny, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sure they're paying out
the ass to have that space. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - We should put a Trash Taste bar there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - A Trash Taste bar in Golden Guy? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - A Trash Taste special, build a bar. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Build a bar in Golden Guy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> All three of us build our
own bars in Golden Guy, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> see who makes the most money
at the end of the night. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't even wanna do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't even wanna think- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - A logistical nightmare. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't even wanna think
about how much it must cost </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to rent out a space there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'd get really claustrophobic
working one of those bars. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's cozy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - You think it's cozy? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I think it's cozy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It depends. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've been in some where it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I literally can't stand up
straight inside of them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's literally a shoebox. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - And I don't even know
how they get into the bar </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> let alone work behind the bar. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, most of them are four feet tall </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like (speaking in
foreign language), right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - They probably don't have any problems. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not built for
someone of my stature. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> If I stand up, my head
literally hits the ceilings. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like Gandalf in Frodo's house </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> in a lot of these places, all right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just constantly, can
I get a drink please? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's normally if you're wide
that's the problem though, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not if you're tall. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - But that's why going in
the wintertime is the worst, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because you're all puffed
up with jackets and shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> You're just like, all right,
out of the way please. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Sorry, excuse me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think it's best to
go at winter though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> In the summer, it feels weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel, in the summer, it's way too hot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's hot, it's really hot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even when the AC's
going, it's still there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Either way, it's very much a gamble. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've heard so many horror
stories in Golden Guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and Nichome and all that stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just don't go into a bar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> if someone tells you to go into a bar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's the rule of thumb. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - If somebody is trying to
tell you to go into their bar, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that's a good sign to
not go into that bar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably a bad idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Gentlemen, this episode of Trash Taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is sponsored by ExpressVPN. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Going online without ExpressVPN </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like using your
smartphone without a case. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's barbaric. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Most of the time, you'll be fine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but all it takes is one incident </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for you to wish that you used a case. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Every time you connect to an
unencrypted network in cafes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hotels, airports, et cetera, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your online data is not secured. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> It doesn't take much technical
knowledge to hack someone, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just some cheap hardware. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> So hackers won't be able to

<SPEAKER_04> And it's super secure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It would take a hacker
over a billion years </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get past ExpressVPN's encryption. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And me and the boys have

<SPEAKER_04> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I've only been
to Golden Guy two times. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I haven't been that many times. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's been a interesting
experience every time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, the last time I went
was with you guys at that bar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think that was fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, which was really, really fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was a good time.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - When was that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the one that Jan came to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, that one, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And he immediately went behind the bar </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and starts serving drinks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - He just took over the bar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - He just took over, yeah! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it 'cause the
woman who was at the bar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> got tired or something? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it was owned by this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what looked like a, at least,
70, 80-year-old old lady. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> She was really, really nice, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but she was clearly standing
at the bar all night. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And the moment Jan came in, she was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, that looks a charismatic enough guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to take over my bar for the night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She literally ushers Jan over, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there were no seats left. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause there was us three and
two other Japanese people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so small. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So Jan comes in, he's like,
"I got nowhere to sit." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Old lady just ushers Jan over
and is like, "Take over." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then she just goes behind the back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we never see her for
the rest of the night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, we can
just leave if we wanted to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Obviously, we paid at the end of it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like 1,000 yen a drink, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but it was like you
were pouring the drinks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was like you could just make
it as strong as you wanted. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Exactly.
- It was really strange. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> It was a really fun time though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It became a self-service bar, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and I don't know how Jan has this effect </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> basically everywhere he goes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where he just sweet talks
the fucking restaurant, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the waiter, or the bar lady
to give us the special service </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or the special menu, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the menu that doesn't exist, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's always someone like
Jan who is able to to get- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Jan is the only man
that can somehow pull out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a secret menu from a restaurant </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that doesn't even have a secret menu. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just like, oh, I guess we
have a secret menu now, fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> All right, bring it out for this guy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can you imagine going to a
British restaurant or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like, you gotta
get out the secret menu, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's just toast sandwich. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unfortunately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Toast sandwich, crisp sandwich. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Unfortunately, I think
the UK is the one place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where sweet talking doesn't do anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They just tell us no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really?
- No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never seen anyone sweet
talk anything in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe in a bar with one guy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but in a restaurant, it'll never work. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Or maybe it's because
they just don't have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> secret menu culture maybe? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, we don't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - What would be on the
Japanese secret menu? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> If you went an abroad- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Something slimy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Natto, natto? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cognac or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, I feel like we don't have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> secret menus here either, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just because we don't even
have tipping culture here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because we're just so
like, these are the rules. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> We can't make any kind of exceptions. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why would you wanna hide
something if you're proud of it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - What I'm talking about is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> if you go to a Japanese
restaurant not in Japan- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, I see. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What would be the foods on there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that would be something that you, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a Japanese person very accustomed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> to Japanese cuisine would know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but is, I guess, not
mainstream enough to be- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - So you're asking what the most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> underrated Japanese food is? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Or unknown Japanese foods. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would say it'd
probably be something slimy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like most of the shit that
we've ended up feeling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the What's In The Box
on the charity stream. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like mozoku or natto. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, shit like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like okra, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probably, something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Maybe like, I don't know,
natto in curry maybe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - 'Cause I feel like
a lot of izakaya foods </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> would be on there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, like the blended squid </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and stuff like that, or takowasa. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> That shit's bomb. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That shit's bomb. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, no way, no way. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hey, man, you're part of my team now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> because you like natto. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, natto was actually all right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> It was all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The taste is fine, but
the slime is just dreadful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah?
- Really vile. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - The slime, it's not
even the worst texture </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I've had in Japan, I feel like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It looks a lot of worse than it tastes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and feels in your mouth, I think. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I think the beans taste pretty good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, it just tastes
like soy sauce, I think. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, it smells- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's basically what it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, that's what it is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just soy sauce on soy beans. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, right?
- It's just like soy overload. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel though, because you guys ate it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> straight out of the packet, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you got the full brunt of the
sliminess and the texture, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but when you put that on a bed of rice, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because you're eating it with rice, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it doesn't feel as slimy as it should've. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel like, with a bit of
rice, it would be perfect. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It would be absolutely perfect. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] It's fantastic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean, I guess, you gotta open- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Just give it a go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Give it a go, give it a go sometimes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And if you don't like it,
it's totally fine, I understand. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe you like it, maybe you're not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> To me, I learned that I
just can't handle ketchup. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was a first- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - To be fair, that was a lot of ketchup. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was the first time... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Garnt's referring to
the 24-hour livestream. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To explain, we all had forfeits to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had to eat pizza crusts drenched </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in ketchup and mayonnaise, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I hate ketchup and mayonnaise. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you don't eat the crust. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I don't eat the crust. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna give this the best
go that I can possibly can, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's for charity. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's the first time where
I've put something in my mouth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I had immediate gag reflex. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's 'cause it's your mind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Your mind is telling you
that you don't want it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Mind over matter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To me, like the natto, I was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> maybe I'm gonna gag during the natto. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I had it, and I'm just like- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's 'cause you expected to gag. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think you expected to throw up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> so you were psyching yourself out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> So the moment it touched
your tongue, you're like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, to be fair though,
that smell was pretty dreadful. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I had to do the ghost
pepper. That was dreadful. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - How was that experience? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That hurt. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> See, because you guys were saying, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everyone in the chat was saying, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, look forward to the next morning. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're gonna be shitting through a straw. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, oh, god- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, the ramen was way worse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, the ramen was
way worse that we had. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I was fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I had maybe one painful shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then, I thought that was
gonna the beginning of the end. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, no, just one.
- No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - The one that's spicy
is the only one you get. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But yeah, I was fine after that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I look back on the clip of me shivering </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for 15 minutes afterwards. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I literally look like
I'm about to fucking die. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I was getting slightly worried </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> when you started shivering, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but I know it's because your
body is just going into shock. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your body is rushing
you of fucking adrenaline </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and endorphins and all that kinda shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I just remember seeing you go like this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm just like, "Joey,
are you all right, man?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think the worst part about it is, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> when you watch that out of context, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you see a dude who looks
clearly sleep deprived </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with huge bags under his eyes shivering. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I just looked like a crack addict. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I just looked like I
was having withdrawals. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I was sleepy just going like, (panting). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was not the best look. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think the sleep
deprivation helped as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I can't imagine trying
a food that you really- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like seven in the morning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it was seven in the morning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> We were up for like 20 hours
at that point, and you're like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It taste good?
- Perfect time, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> perfect time to eat a ghost pepper. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> To be honest, I couldn't taste anything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh.
- Yeah, there was no flavor. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Was it as painful as
you thought it would be? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I find that sauces, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like really heavy sauce-based
dishes that are spicy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are the hardest to eat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the Hot Ones stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can eat all of those Hot Ones sauce, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the hottest ones, on wings, no issue. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't need milk or anything like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It tastes good, like the Last Dab. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I slather everything in that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's all good, 'cause
it's just a few bites, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's very solid. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But we did the ramen video for yours. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that wasn't that spicy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I'd say it's not as
spicy as a ghost pepper </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or a Carolina Reaper,
because it's just sauce. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> It coats your mouth, coats your esophagus, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it goes into your stomach. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It hurts so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And then it takes a while, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so you just keep eating and eating. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I definitely struggled more, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think, with that than the ghost pepper. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - One burst of spice is not that bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's when you keep eating bursts of spice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that the pain just multiplies.
- It builds up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - You don't give yourself a break. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why eating one
Carolina Reaper, for me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is totally chill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could do it now, and we
could still film the episode, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it'd be chill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Those competitions where they eat 40, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, that's fucked, that's fucked up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - How has anyone not died from that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know, 'cause- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, I don't think- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Can you die from spice? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, you can go into shock though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can go into shock, but I don't... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Has there been a recorded case
of someone dying from spice? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm not sure if there is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There has been? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] You can burn a
hole through your stomach. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't necessarily think
that's true though, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You'd have to have a
pretty weak stomach though, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel, for that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's a factor of things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - For me, as someone who loves spicy food, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> trying to explain why I
eat spicy food or why... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Jerry's said to me all the time, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, I don't know how
you can get through that" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think, one thing
that's really underrated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about why people eat spicy food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that the spicy food needs
to taste good, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When we think of spicy
challenges, we just think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about getting through how
spicy this spicy meal is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or getting through this
fucking pepper or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> A big draw of spicy food is that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> even if you're in fucking pain
and your mouth is hurting, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if it tastes good with the spice, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you wanna finish it, and you wanna eat it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it tastes good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, that was it
with the ramen video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would not have finished that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if it didn't taste as good as it did, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it tasted really fucking good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If that did not taste good, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would've just been like, no, fuck this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I've had, for example, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the Coco Ichiban level 10 spice. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And it is spicy, but it
doesn't taste good at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> It just feels like you're making
it spicy to make it spicy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just artificial? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just artificial. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Sometimes it just feels like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is just a flex at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> where we can make it this
spicy, but it doesn't even, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the taste doesn't marry
well with the spice at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Proper good spicy dishes
need to taste good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It needs to complement
the actual base food. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> For example, I have Thai
food without the spice, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> and it literally does feel
like there's a component </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's missing from the food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, fuck, so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, what are you gonna say, Ashley? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] Capsaicin does
cause tissue inflammation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so a large enough dose
could cause serious damage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to your stomach and intestines. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel you'd have to have
an egregious amount though </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to hit that point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] Or something really spicy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd have it all in one sitting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could do enough damage
to potentially kill you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - My ex-girlfriend was Sri Lankan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember when I went to
meet her parents and stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything had chilies in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was amazing. I loved it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was breakfast, omelet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We had five of those peppers
that you put in Thai food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I ate 'em all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, I don't know
if I told this story, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but her mom came in and was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Why did he eat the peppers?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Am I not
supposed to eat the peppers?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she was like, "No,
you'll get stomach cancer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you eat the peppers." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Why would you
put them in the food then?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They were delicious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was also another restaurant, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause she took around to a
bunch of the local restaurants. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there was one thing
were it was deviled mutton, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it was called, or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds badass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like the most
delicious marinated mutton </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd ever had in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Damn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it was like doom level of spice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, if it's got the word devil in it- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Devil, yeah.
- Devil's blood. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm tearing up, but I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fuck, it's so good. (whimpering) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Even though I was in so much pain, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, just another bite. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the thing about spicy food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If it's really good spicy food- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You power through, you power through. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck me, just one more bite. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When you take the bite, you're in a pain, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but you're just like, oh,
it just tastes so good! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know how to explain it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but when it's super spicy
and super delicious, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's almost like it's
searing in the flavor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> into your tongue.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I'm like, this is
so much flavor! (screams) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it's almost like,
if you take the spice out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for example, I've had unspiced Thai curry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've had unspiced Indian curry as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause we live in England.
- No, don't do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Come on now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The best way I can describe it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is that it just tastes flat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It tastes flat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> There's something that's
missing from the taste. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like uncarbonated soda. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, kinda. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> That's a good analogy actually. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> The flavor's there, but there's a texture </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or something is missing.
- The flavor is there, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but the personality is gone. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Exactly. (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Indian curry, if you
have rice with it too, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or you have naan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like that's so nice
to have spice with it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause then it kinda
helps mellow it out a bit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
- That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, see, 'cause I never,
for the longest time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't understand that
concept of spice enhancing food, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because up until, I'd say,
maybe three or four years ago, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could not handle spice at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If I went to Coco Ichi,
I would do level one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> which is like the most basic shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'd just be like, "No,
too spicy, I can't do it." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then, I don't know what it was that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where just one day, I
kinda just flipped a dime. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It hurts, but I'm enjoying
it for some reason. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What is this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had the opposite journey of Joey, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone who's grown up with
Thai food and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember, when I was a kid, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I really did not like
Japanese food at all, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because a lot of Japanese cuisine revolves </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> around the natural flavor of stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Savory. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Savoring it and just bringing
out the natural flavors </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the ingredient. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And me, a Thai person, being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there is not enough
ingredients in this dish. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What, sushi? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sushi, what, that's just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Two ingredients. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's rice and fish. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where's the spice? Where's the flavor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wasabi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But yeah, three ingredients like rice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have rice with a bit of
vinegar in it, fish, and wasabi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, where's
the five million spices </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to go with it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What? You dip it in soy sauce? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Where's the chilies in the soy sauce? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where's the kick? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, where's the kick? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Japanese cuisine was my
least favorite cuisine, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> because to me, there just
weren't enough extra spices </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> or extra ingredients
to enhance the flavors. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is this unseasoned sushi? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And then, as I grew
older, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> as I grew older, I learned
to really appreciate </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the subtleties in the
flavor of Japanese cuisine. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> It really enhances the good ingredients. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just rice, isn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's just rice.
- It's all just the same. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Sushi chef straight up for 20 years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to get the perfect rice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's all rice, isn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's all the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is this, Uncle Ben's? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> What is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you put it through a colander? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is this microwaved? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you wash this rice? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you wash this
rice through a colander? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's microwave rice, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Five-minute rice? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Minute Maid rice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I fucking love the golden rice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> in those microwave packets though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I fucking love that rice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, the ready-to-make ones, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, dude.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It tastes so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah, they do taste good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably 'cause it has all
the artificial shit in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fast food rice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> How do we make rice
unhealthy, super unhealthy? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We found a way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, honestly, the fast
food, the packeted fried rice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that you can buy is actually pretty damn- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - In Japan, it's pretty good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - The one that you buy in the freezer? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah.
- I used to live off it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, oh, well, I made
curry, and I don't wanna make, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't have a rice cooker at the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I hated making rice the
way that my mom taught me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> which is just boil a pan
full of water and guess. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Which sometimes works, sometimes didn't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - But doing it in Japan is blasphemous. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know, I know, I know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's weird, 'cause you'd
think that the first people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to adapt an easier way to
do it would be white people, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause they love being lazy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] That's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You'd think rice cookers would go down, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> especially for the UK where we love rice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We love eating it with
curry, so you'd think that- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do people in the UK love rice? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - With curry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's pretty much it though. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - But that's the only
thing we eat half the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> We eat chicken tikka masala,
it's like every week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You'd think that we would figure out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hey, these rice cookers aren't so bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - 'Cause I remember growing up in the UK, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> whenever I'd have my
packed lunch of whatever, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it would be like something- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, you'd never make
rice for a packed lunch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's a dinner thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, no, it's-
- No, sorry, tea, tea. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> No, fuck, it is dinner.
- Supper? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It is dinner.
- Supper. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Whatever you wanna call it.
- Tea is a Northern thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sorry, sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tea to me is the drink, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I could see that, tea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know, I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - As with most of the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know, I know, I know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - As with most of the developed world. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Tea for me is a twit longer. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Awful joke. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Awful joke, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, but I remember
having this conversation </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with my mates, and they were like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> "Wait, you eat rice every
day with every meal?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah,
you have it with every meal." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> They couldn't wrap their
heads around it, I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - You bougie motherfucker. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You eat rice with everything? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You don't take a break
from rice? It's everything? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, yeah, it's Asian cuisine. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You literally eat rice with everything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm sure the Asians are
asking the same thing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> being like, wait, you use
bread with everything? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Every meal is with bread? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's bread or potatoes? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that it?
- Bread and potatoes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why not both? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Carbs on carbs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I think it's grown
a lot in popularity though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> in the last 10 years especially. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Rice? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, definitely not when
I was growing up at all. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's become way more popular, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> rice-based dishes in general. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I say finally. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> What took them so long?
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I think there's enough dishes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where people are making
them where a rice cooker... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> People buy bread makers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> People aren't making
bread every fucking week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And those things are fucking massive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - My little rice cooker is this big. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But the point was, before I did this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I used to just buy the microwave packets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 300-gram packets, perfect
portion, tastes great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Slap it on the plate, you're good to go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Amazing, amazing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I actually think those, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I also survived without a rice cooker </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in university for a long time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause the microwave
packets were good enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The problem with a rice cooker, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I find, is that the rice
goes off so fucking quick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So either you cook a tiny bit of rice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> in this massive rice cooker, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I'm Asian, and of course, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if a mom buys you a rice cooker, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like the biggest fucking rice cooker </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can ever imagine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - How many families do you wanna feed? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like those restaurants
ones where it's this big. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Luckily, there was
a humanitarian crisis, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but it wasn't for long, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause Garnt had his rice
cooker that his mom gave him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, 'cause my mom bought me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a rice cooker for university, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause that's one of the
essential pieces of equipment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you need for university </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for every Asian kid
that their mom provides. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They provide you a rice cooker </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> that could survive a nuclear winter. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm pretty sure you
could hop inside of it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and survive a blast, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But the problem is, I would
always cook too much rice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> or too little rice, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It would be either too much
for the meal I was cooking, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I would have some leftover rice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Or I would cook too much rice, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the rice just goes off so quickly, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even if you put in the
fridge or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Because unless you're really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this is the Asian trap, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because with the rice cooker, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to eat rice every day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in order to eat all the rice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you cooked with the rice cooker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Otherwise, it's just gonna go off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So that's why actually
the microwave packets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> were just the perfect
portion for one meal, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it was just a lot less effort. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because then you
have to start experimenting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You look in your fridge
and be like, all right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what can the rice go with
that I haven't tried yet? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - However can you dehydrate
the rice that you've cooked, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> turn it back into a rice grain? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is that possible? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, I mean- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Could you do that if
you had the technology? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm asking is it possible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, I mean, I've put a- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you tried? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] No, it's like popcorn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't turn back the popcorn to its- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, that form is
completely different though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The rice stays the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think if you took the water out somehow, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe we could do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Scientists, can we un-hydrate rice? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - My family, or actually a
lot of Japanese families, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> what they do is, if
they make too much rice, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then you put it into small
maybe microwave-sized packets, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then you put it in the freezer. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yes, that was also
what happened as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - But it's not the same. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The next morning, you wake up being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay, there's some leftover rice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If I don't eat it, my mom's
gonna fucking throw a hissy fit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so let's just get it out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Defrost that shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But there was no space in my freezer </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> to put extra packets of frozen rice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you know why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> As a university student, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what happens when your mom comes over? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> She brings you eight Tupperware
boxes full of takeaway food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you gotta put it in the freezer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It lasts you the entire day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, you're that asshole.
- No, the entire fucking term. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I was that asshole, I was that asshole. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You're that asshole. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know when you go to share a freezer, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and some fuck takes up
the entire fucking thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause he decided that
he was gonna meal prep </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an entire month?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're a cunt, you know that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> We gotta share the freezer? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Where is my Ben and Jerry's gonna go? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where am I gonna put my vodka? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just wanted one Ben
and Jerry's in here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is that too much to ask? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You start playing "Tetris"
with all the rice packets. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, 'cause my mom would come to visit me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> once a month in university. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And every month, she'd
bring two full Sainsbury's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my god.
- Bags worth of takeaway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> boxes of food.
- Holy shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - And I'm just like, that is... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How many people were you
sharing one fridge with? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Six or seven or something like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So at best, you have
half a shelf to yourself. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you have one, a
freezer is even smaller. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - The freezer was smaller, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you had, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Two items to put in the freezer? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt, you must've been hated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They must've hated you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I probably was hated.
- They probably hated you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would throw a fit.
- I would've hated you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd be like, Garnt, mate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> either you're sharing this with me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's my real estate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or I'm putting stuff in there, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Now you gotta say bye bye. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're invading my
property a little bit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Gonna have to pull the short gun on that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're gonna have to
haggle with me here a bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> We gotta figure something out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh, god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What it's like living with
a Southeast Asian guy or girl. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's realizing it.
- Whenever their parents come </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to visit, they just
bring a shit ton of food. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why it's part of our culture. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like that's just
like an Asian in general. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is it true with Japanese? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause I know it's true with
Southeast Asian and Chinese- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know when I was living with, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I know when I was living on my own still, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my aunt used to come over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and just buy me a shit ton of food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was when I was house
sharing with two other people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I was also the asshole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that took up 80% of the freezer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I knew very well- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't believe I'm
cohosting with these assholes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> these barbarians, filling
up the fridge selfishly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Hey, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is our turn to colonize. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> We're colonizing one freezer at a time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - How does it feel? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hey, I'm Welsh, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm Welsh, bro, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] How does it feel now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Welsh can't get a
break, man. Fuck, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh, god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - One freezer at a time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> We're coming for your freezers, okay? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - This episode is sponsored by Levoit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Lads, something smells a bit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - What is this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Why is there a PC and
dirty laundry on the table? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Fear not, lads, for we

- Oh no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Joey, what's in it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Please tell me it's
not what I think it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] What's in the sock? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not cat poo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my god.
- It's a letter. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Meilyne didn't do anything! Thank god! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my god, the sock is telling me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that the GP lifespan and performance </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can be cut by over 50%- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my god.
- Due to overheating </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> commonly caused by dust? </SPEAKER_06>

- Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Did your parents send you care packages </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when you went to university? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I say no, they might say otherwise. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, how dare you don't remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They might see this episode and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "We sent you things, Connor." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think they did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna say that, no, I don't think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember the last house
I moved into in university, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like, we moved
in, it was a bit beat up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It wasn't great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And my mom was mortified. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She was like, "Oh my god,
this place is a shithole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my god, you can't
be caught living here." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "It's not that bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll get over it. I'll be fine." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just remember her reaction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought she was actually gonna be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You can't, you can't, you
have to find somewhere else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is too old." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "No, it's fine." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It wasn't even that bad.
It was just kinda messy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is this the one in Swansea? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that one was the
one that later had rats. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I don't think the rats were a part </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> of the initial moving-in thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> They joined later. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They moved in with me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They were the other roommates. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They weren't part of the package? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I didn't preorder
those unfortunately. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, no, I mean, fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm trying to think now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I only ever had white roommates actually. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It sounds bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I guess, in Swansea, there
isn't much diversity. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There wasn't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I did have some friends who
were from Chinese schools, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but most of them didn't speak- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like exchange students or? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - A lot of foreign
students come to the UK. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, right, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The UK has a lot of
foreign students in all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That makes sense. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, there's a ton of universities. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I think, every city has two. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, you guys have some of the highest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> universities as well, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - A lot of people come for that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - A lot of prestigious ones as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Not Swansea, but maybe
another prestigious one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe Oxford was full. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had some friends that were Chinese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they didn't speak much English. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There was such a, I
can't remember his name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I had did some projects
with him in first year, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he didn't know what
the fuck was going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We kinda just helped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We were like, "We'll just
help you. We'll just do it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was like, "Thank you, thank you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll return the favor." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then, he never returned- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We never saw him again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He never returned the favor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Never saw him again, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, two years
later, same engineering. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, oh my god, I saw him again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "How you doing, man?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And his English was quite
a bit better this time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He spoke a bit more English. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Still wasn't great,
but it was pretty good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was really
struggling with this thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And we had a spare slot in
our group, and we were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Just join us, 'cause we're
basically nearly done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And you'll get a passing grade." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was like, "Oh, shit, no way." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We were like, "What do you do for fun?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, "I'll show you." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Dead ass, we're in the computer libraries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just working on this thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this is when we
invited him to join us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're just talking, 'cause
he was sitting with us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we're like, "Oh,
yeah, what do you do?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, "I'll show you, show you." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So he takes us outside. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He just starts breakdancing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Insane.
- Fuck yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Insane, 'cause he didn't
wanna explain it or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember what it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> He just starts doing
insane flips and shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> We're computer nerds and engineers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we're just like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was so bizarre. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - The glow-up, dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then he was like,
"Yeah, I love breakdancing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's my passion and stuff." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "Nice, dude, nice." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "What are
you gonna do after this?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's like, "I don't fucking know." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, "I'm just here
until my parents drag me back." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "I don't
know, fair enough." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Breakdance my way to a degree. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And so, he was like, "By
the way, I didn't forget. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I wanna return the favor for
you guys helping me so much." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Oh, yeah? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't see him for a long time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then one day I was on
the bus back to my house, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he was there, he was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Dude, let me return the favor for you." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, "Oh, okay, sure, sure." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so we go into town. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's like, "Look, my friend
owns this boba store." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, yeah, I don't wanna
be racist, but it makes sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - It made sense, yeah.
- It makes sense, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your Chinese friends own the boba store. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It makes sense, it makes sense. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - My first time ever having boba. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he's like, "Yeah, you gotta
try this. This is amazing." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, really?
- He said, "You love tea?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Yeah, I love tea, I love tea." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd never heard of boba before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> This is like 20- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is this before it exploded, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, this is 2015.
- Before the boba explosion. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I've never even seen this stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they were putting these, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> what I thought were, balls into my drink, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> tapioca at the time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He puts 'em in, I'm
like, "I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> This isn't like tea I've had before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's cold?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I don't know about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So I have this, and he makes it for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's like, "It's free of
charge, free of charge." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, all right, I'll give you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how much
this work would've cost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I charged you, but all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Free boba.
- I was very grateful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I drink it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And immediately, I'm like (coughing). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm choking on this fucking tapioca ball. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like (coughing). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, you gotta Heimlich maneuver me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I spat out the boba in
the store. It was so bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I suck on it, and like
the whitest thing ever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I went (coughing). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is the whitest story ever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> White man tries tapioca
for the first time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Literally spat it out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "I'm so sorry." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, "No, it was funny." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "Oh, okay." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "But the milk part tasted good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Can we get rid of the balls?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's like, "Yeah, we'll
just make you another one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without the balls." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "No, no, no, you don't have to." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, "It's free, don't worry." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got you, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like, "Aw, okay, okay, okay." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's nice of him. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, he's very, very nice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - God, I remember when
the fucking initial boba </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> explosion happened in Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - How did that happen?
Why did that happen? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's so weird, 'cause
the month we moved here, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was like every boba store, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you would tell which boba store, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> what was a boba store, sorry, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> if it had a line outside. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - There were some boba stores
near my house at the time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it was like, legit, on weekends, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was legit like a four-hour wait. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I don't get it.
- And I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't get it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just bit a tea with some jelly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Man, did that die though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It fucking sped-run death. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dude, I like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did it speed-run death? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I think it's still-
- Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, you never see lines anymore. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, you go to a boba store now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's maybe one or two people there max. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, they're still a thing
in the UK from what I can see. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They still exist, the stores still exist- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, it's still around,
but it's not the hype. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The hype is nowhere near.
- It's just the hype, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I mean, rightly so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I thought it
was overrated the fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] I think so too. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I didn't get what the
craze around it was. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, I drank a
shitload of it during uni, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because we had a boba store
near where we studied. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but that was before the explosion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It lasts a while, 'cause it's cold. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> You can kinda just sip
on it throughout the day </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> if you ever get a big one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Also, if you're a uni student,
it's a great sugar rush. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And also, it keeps you concentrated. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I guess, everyone after a
while was, in Japan at least, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> were like, all right,
back to Starbucks now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah, back to Starbucks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Back to the way life should've been. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just saw nothing but just iced tea, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or iced coffee, I don't know, maybe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> To me, it was like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's not fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> There's no personality. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm a hot boy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I like my drinks hot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't really like cold drinks that much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - They had hot boba too
though, right, I think? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hot boba is just not the same. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - They have hot boba?
- It's not the same. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, I think they do.
- What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But it's not as good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I believe you can order
it with no ice sometimes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> You know when you can
customize your order? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's lukewarm though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is true, that's lukewarm. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like piss water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Warm boba? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's like pee water.
- Warm boba? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Gross. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know what maniac
would order a warm boba, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> but it was an option in some </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of the boba stores I've been to. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - If it was a specialty, I'd
be like, okay, if you say so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Was that a secret menu? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] The secret menu! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you have to speak
Chinese to get that one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, got my Chinese friend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can I get the lukewarm boba? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like, aw, you know your shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know how or why it exploded, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I remember, not just in Japan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but just pretty much everywhere in the UK, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> everywhere in Thailand, you
just couldn't get away from it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Even in the States,
I remember it was huge. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was fashionable. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I think it's just a fashionable drink. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I guess so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's Instagram-able. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's Instagram-able. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's be honest, 2014
was all the Frappuccino. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> That's what it was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true, that's true.
- It came out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Everyone just wants a photogenic drink, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and boba looked photogenic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I feel Japan took
the photogenic-ness of boba </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and just was trying to stretch it out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to such a high degree where
it was just so unnecessary- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's like everything in Japan now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Everything is about taking photos. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Afternoon tea, I love my afternoon tea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the most British
thing I've ever said. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really, really enjoy going for tea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and having crumpets or scones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That is a weirdly popular
subculture in Japan, isn't it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is, but everywhere I've
been just does it really badly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, I mean, not
badly. It's hard to say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Not as good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me, afternoon tea is just as much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> about the food you get as it is the tea. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And the food isn't great here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The food here looks so aesthetic. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But it doesn't taste good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, that's
literally all they do. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They arrange it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and they get these
beautiful colored things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Then you take one bite of the quiche. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're like, why does it taste bad? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I actually agree. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Afternoon is one thing
that England does the best </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that I've had so far, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because the afternoon tea
food is actually good, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> whereas in Japan, every
time I've had afternoon tea, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it just looks pretty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Also, yeah, it's
gotta be layered, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> The layers are to distinguish
the types of flavors. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bottom is for sandwiches. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Then maybe you get the quiches </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> or the more savory kind of the dishes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's always sandwich at the bottom. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like pastries and stuff like that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So it's savory.
- You got the sweets </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> at the top.
- Savory, and then sweets. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But in Japan, it's sweets, sweets, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> savory, and also sweets. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause normally, afternoon
tea, you kinda have it at, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'd have it in the afternoon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If it's a good place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you can normally skip
lunch or dinner with it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's quite a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Some places even refill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> In the UK, they refill the sandwiches </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or stuff in some places. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can chow down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you liked the sandwiches, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you liked whatever they're offering, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dude, it's good, it's so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You get your money's worth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Expensive though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In London, it's very expensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah, I bet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's good, it's really good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's an experience
you're paying for, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I get that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - One thing I've only seen
really in Asia as well, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> going off the boba thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before, I guess, the boba craze took off- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the most privileged thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've ever mentioned by the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I just realized that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - What? Afternoon tea?
- I sound so privileged, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> me being like, "The tea isn't
good enough, disgusting." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] No sandwiches. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it's one thing I
feel like Britain does well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so I think it's a good- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's no Greggs though, is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's no Greggs.
- It's not Greggs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not Greggs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> But yeah, dessert cafes, that's one thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I only saw in Asia.
- Oh, god. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know if there is more
dessert cafes in the UK now- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Dessert buffets especially. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sorry?
- Dessert buffets. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - What's that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's literally exactly that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Think of a buffet, but it's all desserts. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, 'cause whenever I'd hang out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with some of my friends in
Thailand, they'd be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Oh, let's go to this dessert cafe." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, wait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To me, growing up in England,
dessert was something you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the end of the meal at a restaurant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't go to a specific
place to eat dessert, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> That concept was just alien to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> To me, it still feels weird, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> If I wanted dessert after a meal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would order it at the restaurant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you go to a dessert cafe, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like half a meal, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause you never go to a dessert cafe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> after you finish eating at a restaurant, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you go to a dessert cafe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at really weird times at a day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Three. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, three or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I go to a dessert cafe,
I have the dessert, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and then it just fucks
with my eating schedule. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause then I just don't want dinner, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> but then it also doesn't
fill me up as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It's really weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - So you get hungry at 9 PM. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a really weird
time where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, it's kinda too late to eat food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I know I won't be able to sleep, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I'm gonna get hungry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, I get that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know, I just
don't feel satisfied </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if I've eaten a lot of something sweet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> But when I eat a savory
meal, I just feel happy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just feel sick if I eat
too much sweet stuff now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was always like that though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could never eat too... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like sweets, but I could
never eat too much of it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause then I'd just get... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd be filled up, but then that feeling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of being filled up by sweet shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just made me feel really ill, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> which just made me wanna
eat regular food anyway. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Man, I said this a year or two ago, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but man, I still don't
like themed cafes in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the collaboration cafes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The food-
- Because of the food? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The food and drink is a joke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It looks good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I hate the fact that we're
turning food impractical. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Okay, wow, we put a little... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I went to the Square Enix one. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And then they made me a latte. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, this
latte tastes really bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> But they put a Slime on it,
so I guess now it's worth $9. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, what? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've been to so many themed cafes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause Aki loves going to them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause she makes content out of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it's understandable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the only good one
where I would actually go back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the food is the Kirby Cafe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I know it's good-
- Lies. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Sus, sus.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I know it's good because- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The biggest Kirby fan of all- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no, no, no, no, hear me out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Says the Kirby Cafe-
- Hear me out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Has the best food. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It does. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What a coincidence, Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - It legitimately does, and I know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm not the only one who thinks that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> because it was a temporary
thing at fucking Tokyo Skytree, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> but now they made it a permanent thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So you know if a themed
cafe turns permanent, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that's how you know that the food is good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because if the food sucks,
then people don't come back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a novelty to it
that's really short lived. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And once you've experienced all the food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you've experienced </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that themed cafe's style and everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you've grabbed all
the fucking merch you can, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> because there's always a merch
shop attached to it as well, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then you're not gonna go back. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, 'cause to me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like the food itself is the art. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't draw all over my steak. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't reassemble the carrots
to look like a smiley face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not a toddler.
- But I think that's why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I like the Kirby Cafe,
because the Kirby Cafe, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they don't fuck around the food. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> They fuck around with the cutlery. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So the plates are shaped in certain ways, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or the cups are shaped in certain ways. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But the actual food itself is normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> once you put it on a regular plate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if I'm like
a Scrooge or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just don't enjoy fun or whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but I just don't want people making faces </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or shit out with my food. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't want my food to be a toy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] No, I get that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm exactly the same way where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I go to a themed something
of something I'm a fan of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> then I don't want them to
fuck around with the food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Look, look, I'm here for a good time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to enjoy the thing I like.
- I'll buy the merch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll buy the merch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Give me cool merch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Give me cool exclusive
merch that I can buy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - What better way to get one with the show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than to digest the show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, dude, fucking typical example </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> is when we went to the
"Baki" exhibit, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And I saw this poster that was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, just down the block,
there is the Baki Cafe, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a "Baki" themed cafe.
- Oh, god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And my friend and I were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it was hitting around
lunch time, early afternoon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We were like, all right, let's
go check it out, all right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's go see the menu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I saw the menu, and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the laziest
attempt at a themed cafe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One of them was Retsu
Kaiou's Neapolitan pasta. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, when does
Retsu ever eat Napoleon pasta </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> in fucking "Baki?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like they are really
fucking stretching it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They're really stretching
it to make it on brand. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's Mickey Mouse's
world-famous lasagna. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He loves lasagna. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - One of them was Yuujirou's cappuccino. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It didn't even have Yuujirou's face on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was literally just a cappuccino. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - $9. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - What makes this Yuujirou? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the thing about-
- $10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So many themed cafes are mental in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they have a dish on the menu </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just like fucking
Rin's special curry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from "Fate/stay night." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, when did this happen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> How is this on brand? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Why did you just add a... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You literally just added a
character to a random dish. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You call it a brand? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> They call it branded. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I find it insulting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> You're insulting my intelligence. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You're insulting my fandom. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - You think I'm just gonna buy this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because you put this kaiju on it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll take two. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - If you had put the
fucking Neapolitan pasta </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in front of me, I would've been like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, it's just a regular Neapolitan pasta. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you think if they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "But it's Retsu Kaiou's Neapolitan pasta," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then I'd be like, "Well,
fucking sign me up then! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna eat the shit out of this!" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is why, when you go to
Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he doesn't serve fucking
smiley faces on his steak. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just don't want that, I don't want it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like the steak
just has the initials. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - If you went to a rely nice restaurant... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, just initials burnt into the steak, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you'd be like, what the fuck this this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What is this? Is this a horse? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you branding it? Was it running away? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is our steak. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just don't like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> To me, if a food is done well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it itself is so beautiful,
and I'll pay for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just have the decor of your cafe, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> have everything else be themed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Everything else but the food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't fuck with that.
- Just have cool cutlery. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have a cool vibe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have a cool aesthetic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Make it feel like you're at the place. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - If it's Kirby, make it so
that the toilet is Kirby, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I can lift up his mouth. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> And I can sit and shit in Kirby's mouth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, right, but I think
that's what I appreciated </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about the Kirby Cafe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was that they didn't fuck
around with the food. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> They fucked around with the cutlery, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which you can then buy at
the fucking merch store. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was like, oh, cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is a thing I can use in my kitchen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's kinda neat and dope, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and I don't have to make
a fucking Kirby-themed- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, you'll have to go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you come to Japan at some point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sure there will be tons. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, please, Kirby Cafe's great. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's always a bunch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're rotating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For me, especially when it's cafes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially that are paired with
exhibits or whatever, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Just give me some good merch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Didn't they have the
"Pen Pineapple Pen" cafe? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I went to that.
- Did they actually? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- No fucking way. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I made a video on it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, god.
- Yeah, you did, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I made a video on it.
- How long ago was this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - When was "Pen Pineapple Apple Pen" made? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Six years ago? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Six years ago or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it was 2016. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, they made a- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's how popular it
was. They made a cafe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They made a popup of
"Pen Pineapple Apple Pen." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it was at Tokyo Skytree, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or Tokyo Tower, whichever one it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, you go in, and all of the menu items </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spelled out P-P-A-P. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> That was the only-
- That was it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yep, they didn't even have any pineapple </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or apple-based products, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like you really
missed the ball here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Paprika, it's paprika, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was a "Pen Pineapple Apple
Pen" burger, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> what does this have to do with
"Pen Pineapple Apple Pen?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - With zero pineapple in the burger. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, no pineapple in
the burger, no apple- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's good though. I
don't like pineapple burgers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't mind it if it's done well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But even then, they couldn't
even put the effort to do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The thing I felt the most
sorry about was the fact that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was two clerks who were
standing behind the counter, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they looked so dead inside, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because "Pen Pineapple Apple
Pen" was playing on repeat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> in the store all day.
- Oh my god. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was there for a couple of hours. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> By minute 20, I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wanna get the fuck out of here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Shove a pen in my ear. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Just blur out the sound. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They looked so dead. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's kind of how I feel. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> All of the truck drivers that drive </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> around fucking Harajuku or whatever, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they have to drive around promoting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> these idols or whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, yeah.
- Or this latest album. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, have we spoke about... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I swear we've mentioned it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> There's these trucks
that drive around Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where they'll play music really loudly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] They're called
(speaking in foreign language), </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or decorative trucks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah, and they just blind you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they're awful, they're awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] It's basically just
a moving billboard basically. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, basically. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's weird in Japan
how you can't make noise </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> in your own apartment, but
anyone can make as much noise </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> as they want on the street. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's really weird, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Someone can come around
selling hot potatoes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and intrude our streams. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - People running for government
just scream in public. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just like, what year are we in? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't you have social
media you could promote on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I'm sure you're really connected </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> with the youth of today </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by driving around a truck and screaming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - What do they expect
for everyone to come out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of their houses is like,
"Guys, honey, wake up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> The new politician's in town." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, even if it's
older people, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, they're not gonna
get up just to go outside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to listen to you drive by. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - And maybe that's why they're loud. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Otherwise, they're not gonna hear it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so they just broadcast to all the houses. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Honestly, probably. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - We gotta make it through
the hearing aids somehow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It trends in an interesting
spot where they have to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> political people have to try and go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> towards the older generation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So all the techniques they
use seem archaic as fuck, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's the only way
they can get elected. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause if you're not
in someone's letterbox, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're not gonna get on Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Weird, isn't it? Weird, isn't it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> The whole political system is just catered </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> towards old people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What I just don't understand though is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah, I'm sure they're being
loud as fuck on the street, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> so that, again, as you were saying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it can reach the old peoples' ears, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because a lot of people,
as old age comes naturally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you become hard of hearing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yet these same old people can hear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the tiniest creak from
upstairs and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh my god, that's too fucking loud. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> How dare they walk so
loud in my apartment!" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Meanwhile, I'm having a
really hard time hearing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this fucking politician on 17 megaphones </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just drive past my house. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I need them to turn up
a little bit louder. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, I don't know what... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Are there any laws around how much noise </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you can make in Japan? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Isn't it past 10? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Past 10?
- Or nine? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's something like that, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel, half the time, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> people just don't follow those laws. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And there's always exceptions to the rule. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> You could have like a bunch of... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How come all these loud ass bikes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that drive through neighborhoods </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and not be fucking called on by the cops? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Does your neighborhood have a gang </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> of old Japanese grandmas
who are just like the real- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - The leaders of that
fucking street or whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's 'cause you have a house. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, yeah, I have a house. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, you're
in a neighborhood area. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm in an apartment. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I'm in an apartment as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, 'cause Meilyne warns me about this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> before I was moving in the house. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> She was like, "Be careful about the posse </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of old Japanese grandmas." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm just like, "What are
you talking about, Meilyne? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> What are you talking about?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Lo and behold, now I've noticed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there is this group of Japanese grandmas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who seem to run the neighborhood. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know how this happened. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why this happened. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But you do one thing wrong, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe you take a garbage
out just a bit too early. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You see them, you see them eyeing you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> You see them eyeing you, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can tell. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Anytime me and Sydney come out, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes they're just gossiping together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know when you can feel
someone gossiping about you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's every time me and
Sydney go out of the house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They're always in the same corner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's the same group of Japanese
grandmas, and I remember- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - We should wait for them to say hi. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, you should-
- No, I do, I do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For those people, what I've learned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is that you just need
to be ignorantly happy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and friendly towards them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they'll start to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, maybe they're actually all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Maybe we'll take them off
the hit list, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, I feel like I've been put... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I was friendly enough, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's so much moist- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sorry.
- Amount of speaking here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor moaning) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like I've been
put on a hit list now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> because I did unfortunately
take the garbage out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> on the wrong day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> One day, one day. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Being on a Japanese
hit list is just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'll give you, at worst, a
passive aggressive note one day. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I got that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, remember? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In my old apartment, I got
that English-written note. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, that's the worst you'll get. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, that's
the worst you'll get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They say they'll kick you out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and they'll tell the housing company. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then I need (speaking
in foreign language) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> reverse Uno card, and then they shut up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The housing company's
not gonna kick you out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, of course not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Unless you are actually taking the piss. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if you're just walking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the housing company's
not gonna give a fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They'd be like, okay, granny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - They'd be like, all right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Simmer down, come on now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So yeah, one day, normally,
we take our garbage out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> either the night before or the morning of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know what's custom
in Japanese neighborhoods. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It depends on your area. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, normally, it's like,
I think, the morning of, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I remember, I think, I
woke up slightly late that day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So how it worked in my place is that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the garbage is one day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then the recyclables is the next day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I hated that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think that's most places. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, so I thought
I was just on the cusp </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> of getting the recyclables
out on the right day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's garbage,
recyclables, then garbage again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I thought I was just on the cusp. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe the garbage truck hadn't come yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I go out to the garbage spot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I see some bags there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, oh, great,
I still made it in time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I put the recyclables
out, went back in my house, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just continue about my day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get a ring on my doorbell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I get a ring on my doorbell.
- No way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm just like, oh, it
must be a delivery or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I open the door, and it's
three old Japanese grandmas- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my god.
- Just staring at me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you serious? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I am serious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh my god! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I see my bag of recyclables
right in front of my door. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, they nicely
enough explained to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> that I had missed the time
and it was just the wrong day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to bring out the recyclables, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it kinda felt like
some fucking loan sharks </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> outside my door being like- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It'd be a shame if this
were to happen again. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like repo men. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> You do it again, we're taking everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - They are basically the gangsters </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that run the neighborhood, you know? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I felt like I just missed out on paying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the protection money of the day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, shame what would happen- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - America has the Crips and the Bloods. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> We have the Grannies. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Fear them, they control everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, they're the real... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like the fucking Sopranos, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the Japanese Sopranos, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The old Japanese grandmas- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Did you take the recycling out today? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - I heard some really
strict crazy grandmas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can get pissed off when,
you know on cardboard boxes? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like the Amazon labels and stuff, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they get pissed off you
don't take those off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've heard of some
grandmas that get like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're like, how dare you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Even though it doesn't make a difference. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, of course not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is why I love living
in an apartment building. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can just take it down whenever I want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No recycling day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No garbage day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, whenever you
have garbage, take it down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cardboard's the worst,
'cause when you're moving in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it literally is like cardboard city. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's just stacks
upon stacks upon stack. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm waiting for the day when you're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> well, what's that in the corner, Connor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, it's the wall of cardboard actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's one of the main
attractions of the apartment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have so much cardboard, in fact, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that I could probably house
everyone in the half of Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I mean, that's the thing where, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I remember when I was
moving in, I felt like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if you missed the day of
the cardboard collection, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then you were just fucked, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but also you feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> am I taking the piss
with this much cardboard? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I have a two-meter-high
stack of cardboard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Am I taking up too much
cardboard? Is that allowed? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> What's the limit on how much
recycling I can recycle? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I remember the only time
I had a granny experience </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was moving into my
current place was when, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like the first
week I was moving in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was like the
shitload of cardboard thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And cardboard day comes around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, finally, here we go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is where the cleansing starts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So I take out way too much cardboard, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably fucking half
the Amazon rainforest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worth of cardboard, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Naturally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then, the next morning, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I come out to leave for the office, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And a grandma stops me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, oh no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Uh oh, uh oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And she points at the
mountain of cardboard, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and she's like, "That's
all your cardboard, right?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, "I mean, not all of it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, come on, love,
it's like 90%. Fuck off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, most of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she's like, "I think
that you're really causing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the rubbish people a lot of trouble </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with that much cardboard." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I just reverse
Uno card, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I moved in yesterday." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Puts on sunglasses, walks off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But legit, she was just
like, "Oh, I'm sorry then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sorry about that." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But that felt good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was the one time
where I trumped the granny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, you don't control it! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Silence! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Silence, woman! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] You can actually, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> some moving companies say call them up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, and take the cardboard. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, I did that, but even they, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I had so much cardboard
that the moving company </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> could only take so much cardboard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I moved into a much bigger place, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and I needed to buy all this new furniture </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to fill up the space. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But it felt good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It felt good to reverse Uno card a granny. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Basically, they think
organized crime in Japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is the Yakuza, no. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] It's the grandmas. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's the Japanese grannies
in your neighborhood. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Watch out, make sure
you don't piss them off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Otherwise, you're gonna
be having a bad time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've been living here for 60 years. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know every nook and
cranny of these streets. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Literally the day after
they came, I came back home, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and they had slid this in my letterbox, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just the schedule of the
garbage for the week, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and the garbage collection.
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's so passive aggressive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was just like, oh,
they're sending me a message. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They're literally sending me a message. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - You turn over the
note, and they're like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> get this wrong again, you're dead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't fuck it up again, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gonna wake up in bed with
a decapitated horse head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Get the garbage day right
next time. Don't fuck up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - You'll have a dead
salmon at your front door. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, you better take
this out on the right day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - What day does oily
containers go, Garnt? Hmm? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The ultimate test.
- A shampoo bottle? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A shampoo bottle is not recycling, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love it, you have
this spreadsheet of items </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that very specifically
cannot be recycled and stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I have an app for it, dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Oh my god. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, our ward created
an app being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you put in a certain item, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it tells you exactly
what day to bring it out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - What sucks is that there's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> some items, you're like,
what the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, like styrofoam, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Have you had that packaging that's thin? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like a paper styrofoam? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is this burnable? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Is this paper, or is this- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Plastic?
- I don't know what this is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is a mystery. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And every time I ask anyone,
they're like, "I have no idea." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it's burnable, but no one's 100%. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone's like, "Dude,
it's not gonna matter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just put it in the burnable." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's all these rules that are laid out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that the grannies will enforce you on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But when you put it all into
a fucking bag and put it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I heard that apparently the recycling, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> even though they make
you sort it very strict, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that actually when it goes
to the plant apparently, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know how true this
is, that it's not actually, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they don't recycle it as
well as you'd think they are. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would believe that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, fair enough. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> But fuck, dude, one time I went down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to my recycling thing in my current place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought, hmm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was putting out my
bottles in my bottle thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I noticed that there was 10-plus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Bombay Sapphire gin bottles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, who has drank
this much Bombay Sapphire? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is a lot of gin.
- It wasn't you, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it wasn't me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was gonna say- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought that was you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As another person who
enjoys Bombay Sapphire gin, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, huh, I wonder who's
bought this much Bombay... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna keep saying
it, it's very satisfying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bombay Sapphire gin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Clearly, there's another
British person in your building. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, either somebody's
running a bar secretly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> in their apartment that specializes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in Bombay Sapphire cocktails. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or someone had a good night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or there's a really
depressed British person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> somewhere in this apartment building </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who is really, really spending
a lot of money on gin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just thought, why
would you have this many? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're all neatly stacked, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> almost like a Jenga-esque stacking style. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is definitely one
person who brought... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wonder, did they collect
them for a long time, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they thought, no, this is ridiculous. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't collect this many bottles. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause some people will keep
their alcohol containers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> afterwards as a memory, but I guess, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> when you drink too much, you're
like, okay, this is just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - How many Bombay Sapphires is too many? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just thought, I was
like, this is a lot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, what's going on here? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wonder, I was like, what a weird trash. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> You ever see peoples' trash,
and you think, what's going on? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, yeah.
- What's going on with that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Many times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember the weirdest one I saw was, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> it was a vacuum cleaner
that had been perfectly cut </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in half down the middle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, how does that happen? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Someone's like, damn, man, I
just wanna see what's inside. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it was a Dyson. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It was the body of a Dyson, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but it'd been perfectly
split down the middle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But there was only one half. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, where did the other half go? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Sounds like some serial killer shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was just one half? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was only one half. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> For five minutes, I was
kinda looking around seeing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wonder where the other half is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I couldn't find it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> So he's either kept the other half, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or I've witnessed some crucial evidence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> of a crime scene or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what.
- That's so specific. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was the weirdest thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> At least, I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> oh, well, now I know
what's inside of a Dyson. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's something you'd
see for a YouTube channel. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What's inside of a Dyson? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's inside of a Dyson? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> What if I cut this Dyson in perfect half? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just wanna know how they did it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's either someone has a laser cutter </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> inside of their house, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or they just went ham with a saw. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Either they have a saw in their house, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or it's somewhere else, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then they brought half a Dyson </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to your apartment building. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they decided that they
are done with half a Dyson, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're gonna throw it away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was the weirdest thing I'd ever seen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so annoying having to
get rid of big stuff in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You buy those stupid
stickers from the company. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, you can't throw
out, if it's bigger than, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I think, 30 centimeters in my apartment. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, something like that.
- Which is nothing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's so many things that
are 30 centimeters or bigger. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And if you wanna throw it
away, you have to book. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's normally like three
weeks away if you're lucky. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, usually, it's like a month. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Now I've figured out a genius strat, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> which is just break the thing
down to below 30 centimeters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then you're good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know how, in prison movies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when they escape from prison, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that they start dumping
the soil one by one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the courtyard or something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, all right, you
gotta break this cabinet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> into small pieces and slowly
recycle it every week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I saw that the other day actually. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - People do it, because they
don't wanna deal with... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause this shit is so annoying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Someone had disposed of an office chair </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one part at a time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I get it, I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] That's so genius. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember seeing, I would
go take the garbage out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and one day, I saw the
bottom off, the wheels part. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, why is
someone just getting rid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the fucking wheels part? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> And then, the next week, I
go to put the garbage again, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's the seat. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then it's the seat. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Someone's just playing
Jenga with office chairs. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then, next week, lo and
behold, it's the backrest. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's slow, but it's effective. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is the exact
reason why I bought a saw. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I am not kidding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I bought a saw just to saw shit in half, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I don't have to deal with this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had a lot of wooden
shit, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not paying to get rid of
this fucking wooden plank. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just gonna saw this bitch in half. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's also annoying, 'cause
you have to measure it exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> If it's even a little bit
off, they won't take it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you gotta wait
another three weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and buy those stupid sticker things again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't wanna do this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had a metallic coat hanger, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or a coat rack kind of thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And of course, it was way too big, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if I took the parts off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what did I do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I put it back up, I put it on my balcony, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just let the weather wear
it down as much as possible, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the point where I could
just snap it in half. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You let it rust? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just let it rust to shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I grab the saw or
just snap it half to the sides. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, perfect. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just let nature take its course. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Erosion. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Three months later, I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> all right, I can finally take this out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the worst way to recycle something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but I respect the effort you'd go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to not deal with the bureaucracy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, dude, it probably
would've taken just as long </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to fucking book a time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to throw this fucking coat hanger out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I just don't wanna
deal with it, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or I just wait for someone
to come over and be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Do you want this shitty
thing I don't need? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Just take it please." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude, they make me
feel like such a bastard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> for using batteries. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I just wanna use some AA batteries, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they make it seem
like I was using some kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of radioactive material the
way they made me get rid of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, what's wrong with me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't think I've
ever properly gotten rid </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> of my batteries, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, I'll get rid of them
next time, another time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So I have a fucking
drawer just full of used- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Dead batteries? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Used dead batteries
that I've not been able </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get rid of, because I've always- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is the most troll
drawer in existence. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- Huh? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sure, we've got a whole drawer full </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of batteries sitting here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Go and grab a pair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> None of them are working, Garnt! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what you should do as a joke. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Just get one actually working battery </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and put it in the drawer, and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "There is one working battery." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Find the working battery.
- Good luck. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Trash day special. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm gonna get rid of it someday, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I just keep forgetting the day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> to get rid of the batteries properly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like the most fucked up "Saw" trap. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There is one working
battery. You have 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Find the working battery. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't really use a lot of batteries, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but for a lot of the
filming stuff that we have- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, it's basically
all for the filming stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's all for mics, camera accessories. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's all batteries. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's really annoying 'cause you have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> to get batteries for
that, and it kinda sucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, get rechargeable ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, yeah, but I
always forget to recharge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, but then if you
get rechargeable ones, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you forget to recharge
them before the shoots, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> which is unfortunate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And luckily, you can buy AAA batteries </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> everywhere in Japan. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's pretty good for that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> It's pretty good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Always done well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Anything else you guys
been up to this week? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just trying to think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've watched anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I finished "Odd Taxi." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, you finished "Odd Taxi?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's surprising. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Did you watch it in subbed or dubbed? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Subbed, it was good, I liked it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, nice.
- Yeah? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A very fun show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how they're
gonna make a movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Oh, yeah, they are
making a movie, aren't they? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I was surprised
when they announced </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> that they were making a movie, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> just because it felt like it
just wrapped everything up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I was like, we're done, aren't we? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Also it weirdly seemed like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't think it was as
popular on the surface- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you watch it?
- As it made it out to be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I watched it, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you finish it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How have we never talked about this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought I told you I finished it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, you didn't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would remember. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's because it's so rare. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would remember if you told me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you finished an anime, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I liked it. I thought it was good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I liked it. It was good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> But yeah, again, I was surprised, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not only because, yeah, as you said, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the show wrapped up
nicely where it was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how are they gonna make a movie out of it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But also, it's like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel "Odd Taxi" was one of those shows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it got really
popular from word of mouth. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, did it really get that popular </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to warrant a movie? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know how popular it got, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I remember when
I made my video on it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I made it 'cause no one was
talking about it at all. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I thought it was kinda the underdog. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everyone who watches it I know likes it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's a great show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But that's the thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> It's one of those shows where
I feel you start watching it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because someone who gave it a go was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "It was really fucking good." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I feel like it had a
similar arc to "Made in Abyss," </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> because when "Made in Abyss" came out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> no one was watching
"Made in Abyss" at all, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause everyone saw the art style, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and everyone was just like,
oh, this is a children's show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Children's show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Children's show, which
couldn't be more further </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> from the truth honestly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a lot of children in the show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, yeah, it is a children's show </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in some sense of the word. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's one for the kids. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - One for the whole family. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They can relate. The
children can relate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The children can relate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The children can relate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, I mean, that was another show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that really spread through word of mouth, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then eventually it
won Anime of the Year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the year it came out as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Odd Taxi," I feel, had a similar thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it didn't really have much promotion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at least not that I could
see outside of Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> In Japan, it actually had
some kind of decent promotion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember, when it was airing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every time you'd go in a taxi, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they would have an "Odd
Taxi" advertisement. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did they really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, did you not see? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I don't remember that.
- No, I didn't see. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They'd always have it playing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> in the little TVs that they
have on the back of the taxis. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did they? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - At least I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I saw a bunch of 'em. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't go in enough taxis to know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did I talk about "Tokyo Revengers?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I watched that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think you- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - You have not talked
about "Tokyo Revengers." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Have we not? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Have we not? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Maybe not on episode. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was trying to watch
all the animes of the year </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that were nominated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - When did you get time to watch anime? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, an episode here and there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's very sporadic. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, oh, "Sonny
Boy" looks kind of shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, you're not going
to enjoy "Sonny Boy." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I looked at it, and I was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> oh, yeah, it's for those anime fans </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> that think that they're really intelligent </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and want something deep. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Your IQ wasn't high enough. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - At the end of the day,
they're just anime fans. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'll tell you who
would enjoy "Sonny Boy." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I think you would really
enjoy "Sonny Boy" actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What, you're not the first person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to say that to me for some reason. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know if I should be offended. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, you shouldn't be.
- There's a category of shows. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And to me, I took one look at
"Sonny Boy," and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, this is what fucking Reddit anime fans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are gonna be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "This is the best anime
of the year actually." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I listened to two
soundtrack songs from it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like, okay, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if the soundtrack is as
good as the actual show, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think I'm gonna enjoy this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just cannot stand shows
where I feel like people like it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just to be pretentious. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's one of those shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I felt like the fans
make me wanna not watch it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and despise it more than the show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I get that, I get that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't even know if
I enjoyed "Sonny Boy." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> It's a really fucking weird show, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it left an impression on me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Whether I enjoyed it or not- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, that sounds like
something I would enjoy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I watched it, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this is such a Joey show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What would you give it out of 10? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even fucking know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A five? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - To me, it's still-
- Five, four, three, two, one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - To me, it's still sinking in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What does that mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What does that fucking mean it's still... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got the perfect analogy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Have you watched "Donnie Darko?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - What did you think of it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I liked "Donnie Darko." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - What did you like about it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gosh, it's been so long.
- Exactly! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember I liked it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's been a very long time
since I watched "Donnie Darko." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, fuck, that's one
of my favorite movies. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, so it's kinda like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can you watch it so
that I don't feel bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> about shitting on it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause right now, I just feel </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> like I'm shitting into the void. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What, "Sonny Boy?"
- It's like "86." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, yeah, it's like "86." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I shit on "86," I thought, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, no one's gonna contest me on this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Turned out everyone got really- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meanwhile, the entire internet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone got really fucking angry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I didn't like "86." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> But to be fair, I watched
eight episodes of that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it was boring as shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's "86's" fault. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Sonny Boy" is just 12? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - "Sonny Boy" is just 12 episodes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Actually, 'cause I remember watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the first three episodes of "Sonny Boy," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thought it was boring as fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought it was boring as fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, if you think that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> then, holy shit, I'm gonna be giga-bored. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is like fucking arthouse
fucking pretentious shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the soundtrack
got recommended to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, holy fucking shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This soundtrack just is everything I want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a lot of soft rock,
alternative rock in the soundtrack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, you've listened to some tracks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And I'm just like, I kinda
wanna watch this show </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just 'cause of the soundtrack. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I found it because I was
buying a bunch of vinyls. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> On the front page of the store, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the online store that I
go to to buy my vinyls, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> it just would not leave the front page. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, what is
this "Sonny Boy" thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So I went onto YouTube real
quick, looked up one song, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like, yep, sold. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is lit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The best thing I could
say is the soundtrack </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just sets the vibe of the anime. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Okay, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where it's less about the plot points, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's more about the
feeling that it gives you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you end up finishing it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I did end up finishing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I finished it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I didn't know what to think about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I knew some of the ideas
presented in "Sonny Boy," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's one of those shows
that you don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> exactly what you think immediately, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I just remember some scenes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So is it kinda like
"FLCL" in that sense? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, kinda like "FLCL" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> where is just like "FLCL,"
"Donnie Darko," that kinda thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you watch it and you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't really know what I watched, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> but some parts of it just
really stick with you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and just refuse to leave. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's how I feel with "Sonny Boy." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you think it deserves to be nominated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for an Anime of the Year? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't think it
deserved to be nominated </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for Anime of the Year? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Didn't it win the Reddit
one though, the Reddit anime- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course, it did! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Arthouse pretentious type of anime? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It won the Reddit's,
not the user awards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, the critics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The critic award. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my god! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which does not help its image at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The Reddit armchair
critics gave it the award </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> for anime of the year. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate bashing on low-hanging
fruit, but yeah, I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is sometimes normally an
indication where I'm like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whenever I say "Donnie Darko" is one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of my favorite movies, I'm waiting for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm dangling the low-hanging fruit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - We know it's normally Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Joey's normally that guy in our podcast </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> who's the pretentious arthouse media guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I am, I am. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - With "Donnie Darko," did
you like it immediately? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I only liked it maybe after my second </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> or third viewing of it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I was so young when I watched it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, exactly, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, that was the problem. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> When I first watched it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I was maybe 13, 14 years old, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When you watch those
kinds of movies at 13, 14, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't know what the fuck's going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All you think is, oh, creepy bunny, wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then I watched it
again when I was 17, 18, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> which is the peak of pretentiousness </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when it comes to consuming media. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I definitely had that phase as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Do you understand "Donnie Darko?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Only after I watched a fuck-load
of analysis videos on it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I had a friend who
recommended me "Donnie Darko" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> during high school or middle school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who was a massive fan of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He would tell me his theories on it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we would kinda bounce off ideas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's the reason why I like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of those kinds of
media, because it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when you have another person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or a group of people to discuss it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and kinda theorize and hypothesize like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, this might be this, or
this might be that, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's kind of fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, once you actually sit down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and read into what it's actually about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> according to the creator or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you just realize,
oh, it's not as deep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> as all these fucking pretentious
critics made it out to be. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - My favorite thing is
when people speculate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about media and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then the creator was
like, "No, that's not it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they're like, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> No, I don't think you
understood what you did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I think it's actually this, sir. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Literally the "Evangelion" fan base. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, that's the EVA. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's literally like, no, no! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> My theory is right please! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I think those anime don't appeal to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as much unfortunately. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, and I totally don't blame you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, it doesn't even appeal to me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to be in a really specific mood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that comes along once a
year or once every two years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> where I'm just like, I
just wanna watch something </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and just not understand it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and make me feel things that are- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, the thing I
like about this podcast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that the viewers can align
who they trust's opinion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> on a show based on what
type of media they like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If you're more to me, and
I'm like, I don't like "86," </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you shouldn't then trust
my opinion for other anime. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> That show weirdly, people
are obsessed with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just didn't enjoy it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I didn't know
anything about the series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I didn't know anyone was talking about it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I just didn't like it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think part of being a good critic, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> online at least, or part
of being a good critic is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> acknowledging that you have tastes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause people look at people
who talk about media online, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they should be like,
you should be able to judge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every single piece of
media objectively, equally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> You should be able to
judge them with no bias. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm just like, that's
completely bullshit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, you're not a fucking robot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - When I look at, for
example, Dunkey for example, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I look at one of
his video game reviews, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I know exactly what his taste is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that gives me a better perspective </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than a lot of fucking
IGN reviewers, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because at least when Dunkey... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think, recently, I saw his review </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of "Horizon: Forbidden West." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He didn't like completely- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He shat on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He did shit on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, he shat on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Not completely compared
to some JRPGs for example. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I saw his criticisms,
and I was just like, wow. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I can completely understand
why he feels this way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Me, knowing what kind of gamer he is- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I understand, and that
gives me a better perspective </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of what this game is like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> compared to a lot of other critics. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I would say
the best critics online </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> are the ones where you
continue to keep watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though you disagree
with most of their opinions, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause their opinion holds, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though you don't agree with it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they explain it, and
they're articulate enough, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're honest enough
with what they like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the fact that there's no way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> to completely get rid
of bias with anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they own that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you're like, well, I knew
before coming into this review </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you were probably going to think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a certain way about it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I might not agree with it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I respect the fact that
you can still stick to this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, 'cause it's just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> probably everything I like in a game </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Connor's gonna complain about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And vice versa probably, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, and vice versa, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> But that just comes
with our taste in games. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, and that's fine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - The same can be said
about anime and stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think I cut you off there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, I don't know
what I was gonna even say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, "Tokyo Revengers" was okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I really liked the first half,
and then it got really shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - And now, he's gonna have
"Tokyo Revengers" fans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> on his throat. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - "Tokyo Revengers" was... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I saw the first four
episodes, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> this is a read-the-manga show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I definitely felt that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause there's a fight at the end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you watched all of... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Anyone watched all of it here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I watched the first two episodes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's this fight that
goes on for fucking nine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or eight episodes at the end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it is the dumbest fight
I've ever seen in my life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That sounds like some Aizen shit, dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is literally the fight
of wait, there's more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Something happens, wait, there's more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Wait, there's more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, this is stupid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Just fucking resolve it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is ridiculous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This isn't "Dragon Ball." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like every "Dragon Ball" fight. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - This story has been somewhat concise. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, they drag on a
little bit here and there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They have had some long fights, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but never more than four
or five episodes, I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It just felt like this
last fight in particular </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just took the absolute piss </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the point where I was
like, this is just stupid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And yeah, it had a good cliffhanger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was so bored for four episodes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it doesn't matter, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> All the characters are hot as fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> According to the fan base,
according to the fan base. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - They've got these characters. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I like some of the
characters in the show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> My god, are so many of them insufferable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> God, I mean, I liked the show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought it was good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck, man, I felt like it blew its load, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> and it was making excuses.
- Is it even over? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Is it even over? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, no, it's not.
- It's not over, is it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's not, it's not. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I feel like where they
left it was pretty good, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it might pick up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> It just felt like every single
time something happened, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like, oh my god, there's more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my god, there's more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know, I know this
is gonna sound really unfair, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and this is totally my bias, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I think I only managed to make it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> through the first two or three episodes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because I immediately
saw what kind of theming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were going for with the story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just a bunch of dudes just fighting... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's weird as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Good stuff, but I hate the fact </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that the moment I knew
where the story was heading, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in my head, I was immediately just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd just rather read "Baki" to be honest. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was kind of pissed off as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that all of these kids are 13, 14. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just make them 17. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It would make the story so much more- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] But isn't it
weird that you felt that- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It would make so much more sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - But here's the thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Isn't it weird that you
felt that about that show? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And yet, you see Hanayama
Kaoru who's 14 years old, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're like, perfectly understandable, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have a nice day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - For some reason, it checks out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right, it's so weird
how it checks out though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't doubt it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Because "Baki" never asks me once </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> to actually believe this
world is a real world. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It just completely is like, listen, bro, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> this is literally like the equivalent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of an internet forum debate
where, can Goku beat Saitama? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That is "Baki." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It never once asks you to
be invested in this world, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> whereas "Tokyo Revengers," for me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> felt like it was trying
to get me to get invested </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the gangs and the culture and stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But at the same time, how
are you gonna make me believe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that this is how 13-year-olds
and 14-year-olds react, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they drive motorcycles,
that they do all this shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that they're willing to
rob and kill each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> If you made these kids 18,
they can still be in school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> All of this would still make sense. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Just do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Why? Why? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's basically 90% of anime, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> where they don't need to be that age, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause nobody their age
actually acts like them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is one where I actually felt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it was to a massive detriment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that they were super young. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Every single plot point in the story- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because it just made
it unbelievable, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not so unbelievable, but
it made it so to the fact </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> that it's constantly asking you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to just have this level
of disbelief, to give it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, I guess this is how
14-year-olds would react </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and respond to this situation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, just add on four years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're still in school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> This can work in college. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It all still works. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The universe totally works. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It can work when
you're an adult as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - And now they can ride
motorcycles no question about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No one is breaking the law in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People don't even like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> The only law they break
is stealing umbrellas. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's literally it, that's all they do. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They don't do nothing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's all they do.
- Pretty much. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - How the fuck are they gonna
get a motorcycle at 13 here? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel like, the last time I felt that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when I felt like the characters </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> just weren't acting their age at all, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was when I watched "Erased." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was gonna say, I knew- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Erased" was just like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Man, these five-year-olds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> How old were they, five, six? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They were eight.
- They were nine, I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - They're nine-year-olds acting like- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're like, yes, using
the forms of relativity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> and quantum mechanics,
we can actually predict </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> when we will reenter into
space-time continuum. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - They were more capable
than veteran detectives </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the force and all this shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm just like, bruh,
these are nine-year-olds, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and they're acting like fucking adults. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why I just
couldn't get into "Erased." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's the exact same thing where I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> this nine-year-old girl
is solving mysteries </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that fucking 30-year veterans
couldn't fucking crack. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know we've ranted about
this before and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We've talked all about the age and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I do understand that, a lot
of shows, I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's totally fine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's fiction, it's whatever. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But again, there are
some shows like "Erased" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where I feel like doing
this is just completely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> to the detriment of the show. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> And it makes you suspend
belief beyond reasonable doubt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know, and this
was one of the shows </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> where I'm like, this is just stupid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, there's also
"Your Lie in April" as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where a big thing that
took me out of the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is I feel like they were in
middle school or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think they're 14, 15. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone talks like a fucking poet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - The writing needs to match the age. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't give a shit if
you put 'em in the school. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> You've gotta write
13-year-olds like 13-year-olds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kosei was talking like
fucking Mozart was back then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, dude, you're 15. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> When I was 15, all I was
thinking about poo-poo, pee-pee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's all I think about now. I'm 25. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's all I think about now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> You are way more sophisticated </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> than you should be for a 15-year-old. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, this
guy came out the womb </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> speaking in sonnets and all this shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> He was studying Shakespeare
by the age of three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My god, that took me out so much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was a small thing,
but it was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you could've easily made
them at a higher age </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> to make them feel like
they had the ability </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to speak like this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They were 14 years old. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> That was the biggest thing that worried. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's annoying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes, it's shows where they write </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the characters like 17-year-olds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They act and talk like 17-year-olds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They behave like 17-year-olds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why not just make them
fucking 17-year-olds? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why I think, to this day, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the most perfect example
of a perfectly aged, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> a character's acting age appropriate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in a super realistic
way, was "Golden Time." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it was like, they were in college, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and yet they were super immature </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like most college students are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's a realistic character.
- I like that show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love "Golden Time." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, and that's why
that show was so good, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was so immersive,
because it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah, I know people who
are like this in college. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're such a breath of fresh air </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to have it set in college. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but they were acting
more like high school students </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> than most high school
students were in other shows. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> It's so fucking ironic. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I feel like that's
why, to me even now, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> "Golden Time" is one of
my favorite romances- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love "Golden Time."
- In all of anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just because it actually felt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like these were believable
characters set in a world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that felt like it was based in reality, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> not in this anime world
where 15-year-olds- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 15-year-olds are doing quantum physics. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 15-year-olds are doing quantum physics. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, you look at fucking
Naruto and Sasuke, they- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Hunter x Hunter" was another one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I felt like they
got the characters' ages, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it actually reflected their personality. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Gon was an idiot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> He would be convinced to
do stuff by strangers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like a 12-year-old-
- Like a child. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like a 13-year-old, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No one over the age of 18
is hanging out with Hisoka, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's be honest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For good reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [All] For a good reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause everyone could
tell you he's a creep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> But Gon is like-
- For their own protection. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Gon's like, oh, he's talking to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, I'll talk back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I appreciate it when shows actually treat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the characters like their age. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It pissed me off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause a lot of people,
for example, Naruto, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of people forget
that, in the OG "Naruto,"- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - He's 10. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They're 11 and 12 years old. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You look at some of the
shit they go through. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Sasuke is trying to revenge
his entire fucking clan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the age of 11. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 11! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> He's doing that, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - This man's listened to too
much My Chemical Romance, dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Get off that shit,
and go to fucking hell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll avenge my fucking Big Mac </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if someone slaps it out
of my hand when I'm 11. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I believe that actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was a very petty 11-year-old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Most realistic character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I just kinda wish that it
would change a little bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that was one of the main reasons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> why I was a bit harsh
on "Tokyo Revengers." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And that's why I got more annoyed with it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it felt like it was just
getting stupid right there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know if I've
just seen so much anime </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that I'm just immune to this shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> It's very rare that a
character's age really comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into any kind of specific plot point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or any bearing on the plot itself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so hard to tell a
character's age in anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> based on just their
looks and their actions, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the range of anime
characters from 13 to fucking 28, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> they all look the same, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they all act the same.
- They act the same, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's kinda like Japanese
people in real life, isn't it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Maybe that's why! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe that's why!
- That's probably why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They turn to adults- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You look at a Japanese girl, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're like, you can be 12 or 30. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm kind of afraid to ask. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you see, as well,
for the "Tokyo Revengers," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they made an uncensored version? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Because they used the temple symbol a lot, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is unfortunately is- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - A manji?
- A swastika turned. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really unfortunate, and then they just- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They had to censor that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - They made a censored version- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, damn.
- Where they just don't use </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the symbol much.
- 'Cause it's in the title. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> In some ways, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I feel like they
didn't need to do that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I also kinda get it, why
they wanted to be careful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I mean, I can
see why they did that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> It's unfortunate, but I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with how international anime is now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of people could've
taken it the wrong way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> because they don't have- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also, it may be a good moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to learn about another culture. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right, be like,
why are they using that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you'd be like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna Google, is this okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you see it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> To me, when I first saw
it, I was like, whoa. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you Google it,
and you're like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's only been a symbol
that's been around for, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know, 3,000 years. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's been a lot longer,
yeah, it's very unfortunate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Didn't they censor
it in "Naruto" as well? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I remember Neji's clan symbol </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that he had on his forehead or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> was originally based on that, I believe. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know.
- There's a lot of shows </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I think use those symbols. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, yeah, 'cause it means- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It means peace. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, peace, oddly enough.
- Yeah, it means peace. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's Buddhist, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's very unfortunate, the
dichotomy of the meanings. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] Oh, no, Neji has a cross. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, it's a cross? Okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Unless that's the censored version. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Wait, is that the anime
version or the manga version? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Ashley] It was the anime version. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay, so- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - So the manga version might've had it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - What was the manga version of that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Ashley] Let me check. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So they made a whole
version where they added it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then a whole 'nother version </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they just went
through and got rid of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Really odd. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Nevermind all the violence. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like, if you're
just gonna get rid of it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> just get rid of it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not gonna be that big of a deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Here's the uncensored one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for you cultured individuals out there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cultured? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Actually cultured in
a different religion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Yeah, so in the manga, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was literally the manji sign. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, that's what I thought,
that's what I thought. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Ashley] That's in the anime. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I get it, if you wanna
avoid the misunderstanding. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I get it, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Have the awkward, guys,
we promise, look it up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We promise, not a Nazi. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] It's the same thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the Google Maps issue though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> They changed the manji sign. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
because on Google Maps, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they use that symbol to mean temple. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have that on mine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I have an English Google Maps. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, really?
- Yeah, it's there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, it's on there for me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Maybe on the other languages? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I swear to God, on my
Google Maps in English, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I still see the symbol. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] Because it was an
issue a couple of years back, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was like, what
is this on the Google Maps? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Maybe if you're not
in Japan, and you search </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> up Japanese places.
- I feel like it's on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the person who comes to
Japan to educate themselves. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Kind of. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because they're the ones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> that're gonna throw a hissy
fit and look like an idiot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I understand it's
a very unfortunate thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously, with whom Japan
allied themselves with. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I can understand why the
mistake might be made. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's scary how 45
degrees changes everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just a slight shift, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> just completely changes everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - The power of 45 degrees. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - The power of angles. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> The powers of angles, dude, scary. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - You either want peace, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> or you want something
that's definitely not that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Definitely the opposite of peace. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] Buddhism, I
took a class on this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Buddhism doesn't actually distinguish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between the orientation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and which direction
the swastika is facing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So technically, all of them mean the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, I mean, most people
wouldn't know that though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously, when I saw
it, I didn't feel like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> oh my god, what is this? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I was just like, oh, what don't I know? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Clearly, I'm missing context. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I would like to be educated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I felt exactly the same way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I was just like, it's
weird seeing that symbol, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'm sure they would not be- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a good reason for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sure they wouldn't
be putting that symbol </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> if there wasn't a reason for that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sure these 13-year-olds,
this gang, is not into that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I know that's a gang. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - See, if only everyone
on the internet thought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> had rational thinking like that, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And instead, it was immediately
like, oh no, how dare you! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - We've said it a number of times. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> People aren't willing to give </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the benefit of the
doubt to people anymore. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That's gone out the
window in the year 2022. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Also, they forget
that different cultures </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have different backgrounds and
histories a lot of the times. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what's strange is
that people don't really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wanna give benefit of
the doubt to the country </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or even hide behind their country's flaws </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's convenient for them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But when they don't understand something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they're like, oh, well,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They should've explained it better. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Anyway, keeping on anime, I guess, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess, since I finally
get to talk about anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't actually watch much
anime this previous season, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I don't think there
was actually much good things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, god, don't say that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone would get angry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There's no good anime last season. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, have you not learned my lesson? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - 2021, well, I think 2022
he's been a pretty weak year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> for anime so far. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I guess the only real
recommendation I would have, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> since you were going through last year, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is "Ranking of Kings." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's literally the last one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I've been meaning to watch of last year, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I'm done with last year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's continuing onto this year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Last year was, I mean,
it's a 23-episode show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So last year, we only had 12 episodes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I mean, I guess I'll just wait then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just wait till it's finished? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, it's almost finished. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like it's only gonna
be a part one of the story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, "Ranking of Kings"
is fucking incredible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've heard it's amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's like, unironically, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of people, like "Made
in Abyss," didn't watch it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it looked like
a children's cartoon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it looked badass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I also didn't watch it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it looked like a
children's cartoon initially, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's kinda like the closest
thing to a Ghibli movie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess, in terms of aesthetic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it looked beautiful.
- And feeling. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I really don't like Ghibli movies, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but it kinda gave me that kind of... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know when you're
watching an anime fairy tale </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that kinda feels like-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can only point to Ghibli </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that gives you that same kinda feeling, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that's the kind of
feeling it's giving me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it also is written
really, really fucking well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's been a while since
I've seen just an anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just this well written </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and with characters this
interesting as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Damn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To me, the spring season, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no, sorry, the winter season, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was basically "Attack on
Titan" and "Demon Slayer." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone was talking about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To me, "Ranking of Kings"
is close to that level </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> of quality, in my opinion, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of just how good the show is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, I mean, there's also
"My Dress-Up Darling" as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - There was also "My Dress-Up Darling." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> That occupies a different
space in my opinion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a different faction, I feel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a different faction. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, true, true, true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's the "Attack of
Titan" "Demon Slayer" core, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and then the fucking "My Dress-Up Darling" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> all the way over here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was surprising to see, in Japan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "Ranking of Kings" has
really shot up in popularity. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think it's the most
watched anime right now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's because there's
a lot of voice actors </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> who are saying how good it is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They're all like, "Yeah,
this is really fucking good." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Voice actors have a lot of power here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, they do, I mean. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They're top-tier celebrities here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, they're not even
just voice actors here. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> They're just actors with- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Celebrities. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - They're just gone to
celebrity status as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - And that's why they can
make questionable decisions </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like Hanazawa Kana selling NFTs, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Oh, god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I saw that, and I was
like, this has to be a joke. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And then I watched the video-
- Please say psych. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, please say
psych, Hana Kana, please. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I saw a lot of
people that were like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> no, no, no, I'm sure
it's just her management. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sure it's just her management. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, yeah, but- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But she agreed to it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, someone has to give the go ahead. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Even if it is her
management's idea or whatever- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, she might have a management, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but she's allowed to say no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> No one ever uses that excuse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for Western celebrities or anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's always with the Japanese celebrities. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel that only implies
to kind of low ranking talent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who maybe where the management
has a little more power, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because we're giving you this one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah, the big
ones don't have that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hana Kana is literally
top 1% of voice actors. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She can say no to whatever
the fuck she wants. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - She don't need no NFTs.
- And yet, she said yes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> to the NFTs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - She takes any role she wants. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - She can do any role she wants. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If she says, "I wanna be in this anime," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the directors will be
scrambling over themselves </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like, yes, let's
get Hana Kana in this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> The whole management
thing is just bullshit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - NFTs, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is just Hana Kana fans in denial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> of the fact that she's promoting NFTs. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That is just her fans
snorting pure Copium. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never seen so much Copium. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I saw so much Copium being huffed, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my god.
- It was insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Insane amounts of Copium, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think there's never been... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> One of my favorite memes is just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's a coomer
image of just, thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's just a depressed guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And just, Japanese thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's just him
lighting him up, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Have you seen that image? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I love that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so true that.
- There's never been- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's so true.
- A time where an image </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> is more pertinent than this time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - The other version of that that I love </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is every Instagram post,
it's like, somewhere. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's really dark. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like, somewhere, Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, that's basically
the Trash Taste podcast </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> in a nutshell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But no, I remember seeing that post, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and I was just like, why
did it have to be you? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Why did it have to be you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, if it was some D-tier, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I voiced one passing by
A person selling an NFT, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I would be like, what the fuck ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But you're literally one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of the most notable voice actors today. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is this how idol fans felt </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when their favorite idol
gets through a controversy, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> or they find out they have
a boyfriend or something? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I get it now, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I felt betrayed, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Why did it have to be you, Kana Hanazawa? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm not even mad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm just disappointed. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, right, I'm just disappointed. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Come on, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought we were better than this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, it was disappointing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, I haven't seen anyone
talking about it since. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I just saw it on my timeline, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and I'm just like, well, that sucks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - There were a lot of even
Japanese people on Twitter </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just being like, no, no, this ain't it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, how did Japanese
twitter react to it? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Basically the same as
how Western Twitter was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Really? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - There were like, dude, why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why you of all people? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bro moment, bro moment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it was a bro moment, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, that's been your
weekly reminder that NFTs suck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yep, you know who else
doesn't conform to NFTs though? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Our patrons. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my god, wonderful, wonderful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They could use that money
to do all sorts of NFT stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but thank god they don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Instead they're using
