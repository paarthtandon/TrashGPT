<SPEAKER_01> - Question for you, Connor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have you noticed that
since you moved to Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you just start bowing for everything? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, but you know what I do do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I do one of anime reaction noises. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I do the same thing as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you put a thing, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's weird as fuck, Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Why would you do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like a, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, okay this is why I
make so much sense now, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause whenever they ask me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like anything at the supermarket </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like caught off guard, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It makes total sense while
I do it in anime now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, because I've noticed
when Japanese people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when you're talking to them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they need to make it known
that they're listening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - In England, people kind of
just stand there or just nod. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese like hi, hi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've started doing
the same thing as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Whenever someone is talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm always having to make it known that- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do that in interviews and people like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Can't you just shut up for five seconds? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And just let the other person talk?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But I have to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Damn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, I guess we're
putting that at the beginning. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that's the intro,
go and take it away, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Take it away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (soft music) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's up you naughty Neanderthals. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Welcome back to another
episode of Trash Taste podcast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I am not gonna stop doing this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - How long were you sitting on that for? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Was that like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like two seconds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I bet you have a fucking script </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or just go through the alphabet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Excel sheet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly, I'm like I have to
make an alliteration somehow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So let's just pick a letter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just roll with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, welcome to Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the show where we talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> about a trash taste and
everything else in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm your host for today, Joey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And as always I'm with Garnt and Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We were doing this now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're probably doing this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, this episode I thought we would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe talk about something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if it's gonna
get a little too personal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We'll try not to go too personal route, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but to go back to the whole thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about how we first started
talking about anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and how we got into anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We've already done that episode on that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we've already
done our origin story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But how did we meet? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Or how did we make our first, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how to say it, anime friend? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that a thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, so I have a question for you guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, to start this off
because we talked about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> our anime origin story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like how we got into anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but when you guys were anime fans, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did you have any friends
in school or anything? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or how did you guys deal with that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I was a cluster anime fan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was a complete cluster anime fan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - For all of school? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think that's a British thing though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I got rinsed for playing video games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So imagine if I came
out and was like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like anime too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is my new thing now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It like those drawn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, can you believe I got mocked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for playing video games in school? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And now it's just like
the accepted past time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got so much shit for that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's weird because in my school, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> video games were quite normalized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or was it just your school maybe? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, I got rinsed
in my school as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Unless you're playing FIFA or chords- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which I was and I still got rinsed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would be sitting in
my room in university </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> playing some GRPG hoping
that nobody opens the door </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to discover the fact
that I was playing GRPG </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not any other kind of a game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think if I come out saying that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was a massive GRPG fan where I was you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> playing Persona 3 or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Then I probably would've
gotten beaten up as well, but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got so much shit
for playing RuneScape. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I still, to this day- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I love RuneScape. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember some videos pop
up in my recommended recently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I had a great time watching them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because in my school, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think my group of friends, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we were more so than not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess like the nerdy group of friends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I was too, I was too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So a lot of my friends from high school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got means a games like
RuneScape, like Star Croft. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> other just like land
games, like Civilization, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those games back in the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But when it came to anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I had a really tough time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because I was literally the
only Asian kid in my school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no, same to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was the only Asian kid in my school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - With like any amount of Asian blood. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I'm not even like full-blood Asian. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But they just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, this boy's a little bit oriental." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's nice? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What the hell? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, so I think I was
a closet anime fan for, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man, I wanna say like majority
of my high school life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but then my group of friends who got me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into like Star Croft and
Rune Scape I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, you guys are nerdy enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Maybe I can try and convince
them to watch something." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I convinced one of
my friends to watch Ava. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why Ava? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's not already the gateway
anime I will think off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe because I was
recently rewatching Ava. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I thought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Okay, this is probably normie enough." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That they can be maybe get into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Recommending Ava as
someone's first anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That could go one of two ways. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's gonna be no middle grounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> either he's gonna think this is amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's a fan for life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the thing is I
didn't want to get them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> into like Natto or One
piece or Dragon Ball </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to start with because we all know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if your to gateway anime
is One Piece, Natto </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or Dragon Ball. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's all you're gonna be talking about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for the rest of your career so- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hey man, I don't know man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I got in for Natto, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but I mean I remember the point when- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You got out.
You got out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got out, I got out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was the point when
I would only watch Shounen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I know the exact phase
you're talking about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you figure out
that there's other things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> outside of Shounen that are
pretty cool in this medium. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And some people, I guess
just never figured that out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like Natto fans, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like the British with food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, no, no, no
potatoes is all we need. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Spice what is- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is it about like
it's not obviously not all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Shounen fans, but a lot
of Shounen fans who are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> as you said, like get into say, Natto, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then just exclusively
talking about Natto. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is it... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna know what their
mentality is with anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do they just think that
everything that's not Natto, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just anti? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's like, no, no, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no in between. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's either Shounen or just
like straight up R18 and shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're like, what is this
high school romance shit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna feel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna feel one emotion and that's hype. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Show Jo, is that a type of Shounen? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It must be the thing of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's hype as fuck." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But they just must want
hype their whole life, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, your like a crack addict, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You only wanna feel that
high you get from crack. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like steroids. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There're the same
people and you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yo, E3 is crazy this year." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every game, every game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm hyped for every game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they don't play any of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They like the next Modern Warfare. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but in the moment there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a bad news article about the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that just came out in E3 and they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, I knew it was shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "The whole time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "The whole time." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So like my anime friend, so
there was a group of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like me and maybe like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd say like six or
seven guys who I used to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> really, really, closely hang
out with in high school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I got, one of my friends who got me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into like Star Croft. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I got him to watch Ava </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I wanted to try that
just with one person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't I wanna like bring in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a whole group of people into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's group viewing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I kind of was just
like eeny, meeny, miny, moe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, I add you watch Ava and he was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, I'll give it a go." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was kind of mad about it at first. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I liked anime and I was
like at points kind of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "What the fuck." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that was the Memorial was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, gateway anime important." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And Ava is not bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Always Death Note, you can
never go wrong with Death Note. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah so I think that
one friend he watched Ava </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then he eventually found
Death Note and Onepiece </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and those like the two shows
that he heavily gone into. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So he was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay then maybe I can try
it out with the other boys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey, watch Death Note, watch Onepiece. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was boys before us? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Joey, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This were the OG boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know what the
name of that like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is gonna be really cringy but... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We had like a group. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What was the name Joey? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We were called HBK because we were... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you guys ever play handball in school? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that's an Australian thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's an Australian thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So in Australian schools we play handball </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but not like the Olympic sport handball </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like school grounds handball </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but usually most kids in
Australia stop playing handball </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> by around like sixth grade. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So its very rare that
you going to middle school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or high school and play handball. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We played handball all the way
until high school graduation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And we were the only ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so from no where we were called HBK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is the Hand Ball Krew. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Krew with a K?
- Krew with a K. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it was just out of nowhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One day just the other boys in our year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just saw us playing hand
ball and they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "HBK." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What the fuck does that mean?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then we later found
out it meant handball krew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and normal people would be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, that's fucking cringy." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And we were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Handball Krew." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think handball is something I've only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> heard Australians play in their school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause obviously you've seen
handball in the Olympics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When we had like a British team </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like when did they play that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's completely
different to the Olympic sport. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So when I saw handball,
'cause I'd always known </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> handball as that thing
that you play in school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like four white squares </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you kind of like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's basically just
tennis but with your hand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and a tennis ball in a
really confined space. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So when I saw handball in
the Olympic sport I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "What the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "This isn't handball." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really interesting to
hear you say going back to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime conversation that we were having </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because I didn't even make
my first anime friends, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> till I started YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was years after I started YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I didn't start
talking to other people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who liked anime until
the age of the internet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, I literally started
talking to other people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who reviewed anime because
back when I was in school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and especially when I was in university </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I did everything I could
to keep it under wraps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even in uni? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even in uni. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like top secret confidential. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you find this out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna change my identity
or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember someone walked
into my room of me watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No game No life in university. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was the moment of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "How do I explain what's going on here?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was one of the bad scenes as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have a really similar story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So in uni first year of university </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in England at least we have
this thing called freshers week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where you basically go out
every night and get pissed- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Very, very drunk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Get very, very drunk
and just go clubbing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It sounds awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so me being the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> socially awkward nerd that I was back then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I would still try to go
out as much as I could, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I mean it can get tiring, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> six or seven days of just
pure clubbing every day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> man that shit gets to you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's a lot man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how people do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And then people would like look
forward to it the next year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know how, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel 30 already in this
one week of freshers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So this one night I was just in a club </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I wasn't even that drunk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I'd been drinking five
or six days before that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just in the middle
of this dance floor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just had like this epiphany, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm having a shit time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'd probably rather be watching... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'd rather be watching anime right now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I was just that one guy
who just dances in a club </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and just had the, this is shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially every time I
go to the club, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "I need more drinks." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So instead of getting
more drinks, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm gonna fuck off and go home </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "and watch some bloody anime." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I didn't tell anyone that
I was fucking off back home. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I go of by myself- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're that guy in uni. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm the lone wolf don't talk to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just wanted to watch some anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And what the fuck am I doing in a club </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I could be watching
some big fat animated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is exactly what I did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got that on a T-shirt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I go back to my room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and as you do in uni you're... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Unlike Americans in England
we have own private rooms </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so we don't room share. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The thought of having to
share rooms with with someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd go fucking insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So I have this remote to myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and as you do I take off my
trousers because as a guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just more
comfortable in your boxers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's true, the jeans
are too restrictive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jeans are way too restrictive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So take off my trousers,
start sitting down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> turn on my laptop and put on
the episode of Monogatari and- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The toothbrush scene is it gonna be? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no it was the shower
scene with Senjougahara. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it was like episode two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was really getting into this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, what do you
mean getting into this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Its Monogatari, its a good series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its a good scene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - How sober are you at this point? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I fully sober? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like a little- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like that point you feel shitty, like? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like a little bit tipsy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was just having a good
time because you know when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you haven't watched anime in a while </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and it just feels good to watch anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> after that anime drought, that was just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, man, this is just a
nice break from all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "drinking and clubbing and
socializing and all that stuff." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And as soon as it gets
to the shower scene, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just hear this door creak open like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I look around and
then one of my flatmates </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is just staring at me and I turn round </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just me and my boxers watching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And all he sees is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Senjougahara massive tits
on screen taking a shower. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I try to eye him up to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "This isn't what it looks like." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he eyes me back saying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, shit this is exactly
what it looks like." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You should have asserted dominance just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to maintain eye contact. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then he just closes
the door and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, I'm moving to China now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "He knows my secrets." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then he just never spoke to me again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have a way worse story than that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was again like during high school, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> when I had gotten like the one friend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I got him into Ava. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So he unlike everybody else, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like everybody kind of got into anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was closeted for a while
but I kind of was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I needed to get out of the closet." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to try and convince my friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that this is an okay thing to watch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So you need to make a
YouTube video saying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm coming out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm coming out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I like anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're exactly right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So the one friend, the
guy I first experimented on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why are you gotta use this
terminology Joey to explain? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I was experimenting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're just like Light Yagami being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> funny every step being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, If I show them this
anime maybe they'll like." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like maybe one of
them will like get into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And sure enough, one of them got into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Kick off with Doughty." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So he, just my one friend, he
really, really got into anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm talking like, him and I
would come to school every week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and we would discuss the
episodes that just came out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the night before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like him and I were like
full on like anime buddies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And one night we were
drinking at a friend's place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And, obviously as you do
when you're in high school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get really shit faced, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was staying at his place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I had missed the bus home
and everything so I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "All right, I'm just
gonna crash at yours." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was just him and
I, and we were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "we should watch some anime, why not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Lets just watch some anime." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't know how it came to it but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we were just kind of scrolling through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just looking for something
to watch and he's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You watched this no, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "you've watched this no." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just kind of slowly turned to him, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just as a gag goes like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You ever heard of QC's? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "No, what's that?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "We should check it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "We'll just watch one episode
just for shits and giggles. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Let's watch an episode of QC's." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So imagine me and my
friend sitting in a room, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> six feet apart because we
are not gay, just watching... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just bonding over an episode of QC. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just bonding over an episode of QC. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just sound like every incest moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> happened to like porn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it was worse
because I dunno how long </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> he was standing at the
door but his little brother </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was standing at the door just watching us, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> watch QC and we were like into it too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We all like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, hell yeah." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This kids are like Michael Jackson like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mind you we were very drunk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> We were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Who's your favorite?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh man, they're both really cute." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just full on like, you
would've thought we were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like making a reaction video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We weren't like full on
commentating the entire thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And what was supposed to
be just for shit and giggles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Just one episode of QC we finished </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the entire series in one night. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God.
Did he enjoy it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He loved it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that was the
moment where I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "This guy's a (indistinct)." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't go home with Joey drunk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> he'll try and show you shitty anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I've done that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like the fact that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you had to wait until he was alone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah because, this other
boys were like discussing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how good the Alabaster Arc
in Onepiece was and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I don't think these
boys are ready QC's yet." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> These guys are at level one thief </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this guys are level 10 mafia boss. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Let's experiment with y'all mafia boys." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey is like the sensei
who sees the hidden potential </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in that one student he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I can teach you the way." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I sense it in you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you're ready to learn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You're ready to upgrade. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So did he enjoy more of
that kind of show afterwards? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So then that was the
point where we basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Him and I, we found out
from each other that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> we're into those kinds of
shows and we're okay with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're just into each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We were just into those kinds of shows. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause after we finished
QC we're both just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "I just gotta let you
know broad now that we've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "had this fucking like
journey together that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm like secretly into these shows." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Every single moment of this story you tell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could be like a coming out to each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And he was like dude, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm kind of into these shows." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then from there- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are you doing this on purpose? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Dude I'm kind of into you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mike just had enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mike's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "I gotta get the fuck out." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And yeah, so from that point on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I became a lot more open with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my trashy taste in anime, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yes, I'm hentia sexual." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you purposely
picking words to do this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Then stop this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I am writing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Look, y'all re write this,
this is free real estate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, go for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, but that was the
point where I slowly realized, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if I'm closeted then I'll
obviously have a lot of fun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just kind of enjoying
this medium for myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But there's a whole other enjoyment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when you get someone else into it as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember the first time I
was able to have conversations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about anime with other people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that was just so
liberating for me that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had spent all of these
years enjoying this medium </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but have literally
nobody to talk to about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I made YouTube videos to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay if I can't have
anyone to talk to about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm just gonna talk to the void </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "and hopefully someone will listen." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember having some of the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> genuine conversations online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it had to be online back then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about shows that I liked
and I just felt free. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I don't know
who your first friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like the anime YouTube sphere was? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> For me it was probably Holden reviews </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the people from PODTAKU </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we going and going way back then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think mine might've been Misty, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yours is Misty? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, except for the one in jail, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think there's anyone else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would categorize like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A lot of them were just
like fleeting mutuals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll tell you guys probably
the first proper friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that I made outside of that first- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah because it was
strange for me because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm the complete opposite when it comes to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my friends circle on YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you would think
that I would be very quick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to bond with other animetubers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the one's starting anime YouTube channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But weirdly enough for like
the first two years or so, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was only friends with gaming YouTubers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but that's also because I was doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of gaming stuff
alongside anime stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think it honestly
might've been misty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was the first like proper animetuber. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that was when I discovered
this entire community </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of animetubers I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh my God, I'm not the only one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "There are other people
who do this stuff as well." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then that's when I
kind of to drift away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from more of the gaming stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and focus on what my
channel was actually about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember I realized
we had comments sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that are like me listening
to the podcast and it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "That guy sitting next to." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love that feature. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I love that anime, its so good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I remember I
was doing my A levels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember listening to PodTaku actually, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember I used to listened to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I would do my... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember I have this distinct memory </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of you guys arguing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know over what,
but I was doing my- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We argue over a lot of things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I was doing my math A levels, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was, and I remember
just listening to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Man, and I wanna like be in that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Talk to them." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanna have friends, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanna like talk to friends about anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> even at that point when I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what, like 17, I still had no
one to talk to about anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I didn't really make
friends until university </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I got banned from my
anime club Facebook group. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause they were talking
about like Hellsing Abridged. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Shit, I've voiced in that." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I said in the comments, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, yeah, I voiced in it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they banned me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They thought I was lying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why would someone in our
university first year </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> be voicing in Hellsing Abridged. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I went to the
club and I explained, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like two months later I went, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I happened to go there anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yeah, can you unban me from the club? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't know why you guys ban me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Well, we don't know." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "I know you fucking
know why you banned me." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We couldn't have someone having clouts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was in that group for like a year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I had one comment about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I got immediately banned. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck you, Swansea Anime Club. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They were just waiting for, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a fucking ban have on that murmur. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Nope, no clout in this club." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- My God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you joined the anime
club in your university then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I joined, I paid the two
pound a year membership </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then all they did
was watch Gigli movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's all they did
and I'm like, this is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I joined the anime club in my university </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it was the biggest mistake ever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its like, its weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's like a mixture of like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a mixture of people who
don't really care about anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like one or two people
who are way too into it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or into really different niches. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I felt like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't really talk with... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> None of them watched the same I watched. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was the same with gaming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> The gaming club in my uni
was supposed to be gaming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was Orchard Magic, The Gathering. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean it's type of gaming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's type of game, but
you think of gaming club. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, then diversify a little bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Well, guess I'm not
joining any clubs in unis. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Brony Club it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, go for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was gonna say, I made a
whole video on it a while ago, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I joined the anime club. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was one anime club at Sydney Uni </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I joined it and I went
to one of their events. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Just one, and it was a screening
and it was off Paprika. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, okay, it's a screening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's all the non Ghibli movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, whoever's picking it must know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They have taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They know something
outside of just, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I wanted to watch Paprika
'cause I hadn't seen it yet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I went to it and
the club wasn't that big. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was maybe I'd say
40 people in this room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is quite small club
for, especially Sydney Uni. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Okay, these people all seem
to be excited about this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Maybe let's watch it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this is the one thing
I hate about anime clubs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And also this is the one thing I hate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about cinemas in the U.S </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that they love to fucking commentate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on what's happening in the movie out loud. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I cannot stand that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't stand, especially U.S cinemas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's something that U.S
cinemas where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if there's like a big epic, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like say you go watch fucking
Avengers or something, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And something massive
happens or some whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There's always like at
least 10 or 20 people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who were just like, yeah... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they just go off about like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They give like they're like
fucking Rotten Tomatoes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with you on the spot, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like I'm 80 years old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever I'm one of those screens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Quiet down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm trying to enjoy the film." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, can you shhh, shut the fuck up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm trying to watch the movie." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like special occasions, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's kind of warranted, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like watching End Game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can shout. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watch Chromat AIX, insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The hype made it amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The worst thing was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of my exes I went to the cinema with, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they've never watched a
movie in the cinema before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, cool." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then she was one of those people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Didn't know that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How do you know that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's not like on a Tinder bio, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And then she shouted during
the first five minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Okay." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In my head I'm thinking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "All right, let's not make
this a reoccurring thing." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then like two minutes
later, she shouts again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Please, please don't do this, please. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm British, you can't do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I can't be seen with you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "if you're making a commotion in public." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then that's how I realized
that she wasn't right for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why I liked Japanese cinemas, man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because like it's- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No.
Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, go ahead, go ahead, sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know how you feel
about Japanese cinemas, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a part of it that I like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And there's a part of
it that I don't like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The part that I like about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that people aren't fucking shouting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there rotten tomatoes
reviews during the movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No one says anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - No one says anything but- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I liked that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I like that too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause especially if it's a movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that you need to immerse yourself in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like fucking Paprika, for instance, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like I want it to be just quiet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I wanna get into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the bad thing is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I went to go see the corner Super Movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is easily one of
the funniest anime movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I felt really bad laughing out loud </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because I was literally the only person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> laughing out loud in the cinema. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And every time I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think that's
was supposed to be funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did anybody else find that funny? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've had similar
experiences in a time movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or going into time cinemas
where I remember watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yuni cinemas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't know if it's
just a cultural difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there would be times
when they were laughing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I would be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Why is this funny?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And there'd be a really funny joke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I'd be the only guy laughing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Am I the asshole here? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do I just have a really
weird sense of humor." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know, I felt so
bad because I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Is anyone genuinely not
finding this movie funny? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Am I the only one?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, I hated it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've been going to the
cinema at least before COVID. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was going like pretty much every week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And like there's some of
the things they do great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I showed you guys this in the cinema. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When you buy popcorn and the drink </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they give you this tray. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh that's cool." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you realize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can put it in the
cup holder and it sticks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So you have a whole tray
that's in the cup holder. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fucking genius. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one would have to hold this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just put it on the tray. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't have to put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking greasy thing on your lap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Put your popcorn on your tray </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the person next to
you can have it, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Amazing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the thing that I hate... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Also, yeah, no noise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The only time I've ever
seen them make noise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in a Japanese cinema, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was watching the movie
and it was about a bomb </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was gonna go off in
one of the Olympics, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And this police officers accused... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Anyway, they go to his
house to search his house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they ask him, do you have any guns? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, I have guns." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he shows his, under his mattress </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and he has like a 100 guns
and the whole cinema goes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Every Japanese was like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Meanwhile, if they show
them in the US cinema, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Second Amendment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Weak sauce. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I realized I said the wrong amendment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then also one really
annoying thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> When the movie ends, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the credits come. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, see you guys, I'm off, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese cinemas you cannot leave. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Until the credits are over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And some of these credits go on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like 20 fucking minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like the first few
times I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll respect the culture, I'll wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Credits? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm going, fuck you guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm avoiding credits." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Caveman brain activates again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't care about the seven people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that did costume design. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not sticking around for that long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then I'm the asshole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> who in front of a 100 thing is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "All right, see you guys." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just walking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not waiting 30 minutes- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I found that aspect to be cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because obviously the
people go to the cinemas, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they respect them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna know who did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And who worked on this movie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But as you said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the Japanese like
film industry is aware </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that people have to stick
around to the credits </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "How do we extend this as long as we can?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Its like in YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we're trying to extend a
video 10 minutes, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "How do we extend this
credit to 10 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "to get that mid rolling?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't dunno like, I
used to be the same where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I would think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why the would anyone stay
when the credits rolling? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't give a shit about this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did it once for a movie
that just blew me away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember the exact name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Paul Block. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I remember most recently I did it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after watching Your
Name and A Silent Voice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's actually just
a really nice feeling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to just to absorb
everything you just watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just sit there in silence. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, when a- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes, I'm gonna go there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When a movie hits really deep, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "We're doing this again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we're doing this again." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - But when a movie affects me that way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He got it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> He got it, buddy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> He got it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then it's just nice
just to absorb everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you just watch instead of just being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm off, I'm off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "We'd be good." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's good, that's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's the one thing I appreciate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about some film credits, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If it's like, I really enjoy watching, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the toy story credits </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they do the behind
the scenes bloopers real shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That shit's fucking cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But when it's a black screen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and just white text
scrolling for 10 minutes- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which often is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which often is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then I'm just like, I mean you guys know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we have to stick around for the credits. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Can you at least make it
entertaining in some fashion? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And even isn't it the worst? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, when the credit song is just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not digging this credits at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I have to sit here and
listen to the whole goddamn song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was too lazy for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just leave and then I watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the after scene credit on YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's gonna be on YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you can use the
gauging, Connor, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean, I normally catch, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes when I do it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the Japanese were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Well, we can do that?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they'll get up too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Follow the white man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> No one is stopping me here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't wanna- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "He just cheating the system. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I never thought you could do that." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I do it, I notice
I'll get a few looks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two of the people who
stand up and go as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, join me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Join me." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It is freedom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the trust
isn't that Japan runs on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like buying alcohol. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm slowly breaking that trust system. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The more, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd say the older I get, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the more I have less time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the more I just don't
appreciate the waste of my time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Nope, I'm not waiting for your credits. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Goodbye." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So speaking of Gaijin combo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have you guys ever used the Gaijin card, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like funny situations? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Should we explain what the Gaijin card is? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sure, you should probably- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Go for it, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I'm sure everyone
knows what the Gaijin card is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But basically the Gaijin card, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is Gaijin means foreigner in Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but playing the Gaijin
card basically means </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get away with shit
that Japanese people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> wouldn't be able to
get away with in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But they forgive you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you're supposed to
be like a mindless foreigner. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I try not to
actively take advantage of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I feel like it's
not fair of me to use </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being a foreigner 'cause everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goes through the same struggles, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's hard enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I mean, there's some stuff like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apparently not supposed to
eat and walk here, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If I have like 10
minutes to get to my train </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I haven't had breakfast, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm grabbing that sandwich and eating it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't throw my shit away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't make a mess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm like, it's fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I always wonder that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why is it that a lot of
convenience store food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is so perfectly packaged for on the go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right, right, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's like, but you
can't eat on the go though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like Onigira, that's
basically a rice sandwich. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's meant to be eaten
as you're walking along, but, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "No, you can't while you walk." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No one gives me looks or
anything or anything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just a, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm told I'm not supposed to do this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but fuck it, I'm gonna do it anyway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But there's stuff I wouldn't dare do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like doing the reverse Gaijin card. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I like playing the Gaijin card </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then immediately after
I've committed the act </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just bust out the Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Psyke." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Reverse UNO. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you give us an
example of a situation? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So an example of a situation, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm trying to think what would be, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, something like that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you're not allowed to eat on the go, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like not allowed to eat
on the train, for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I would as you said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes I'm busy and sometimes
I got to get something down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before I catch the train. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I would eat on the go
and people would kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just be like, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then what I like to do
just to fuck with people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is I like to, I finished the food and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just 'cause I love seeing
people's reactions to this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I finished the food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I pretend to get in a phone call </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just talk in Japanese a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because seeing the confused
phases of Japanese, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they will be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Is he Gaijin or is he not Gaijin? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "I don't even know anymore," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is my favorite pastime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've done the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But just when I'm in Thailand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know when people gossip about you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in their native tongue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or they don't know that
you understand them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you just want to
flex on them to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Bitch, I know exactly what
you motherfucking said. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "You better watch yourself, motherfucker." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've had so many experiences like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Especially, when you're outside of Tokyo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they're obviously
not used to the foreigners. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was in a supermarket
once with my sister. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We were like really, really young. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> We were maybe like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll spin maybe like nine or 10 years old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we were just in the aisle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that has all like the snacks and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because Japanese and
snacks like fucking best. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we were just picking stuff out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was this kid probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around the same age as me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who was just like staring at us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from down the aisle, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously because we looked foreign </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he'd obviously never seen
a foreign kid in his life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So he was a staring and then
his other friend came up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I could clearly hear that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, look at these fucking foreigners." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was to that- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - These are nine year old's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, legit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh man, look at these foreigners. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "They look so weird." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or something along that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I heard everything,
and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, you prepare for my backhand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Prepare for my nine-year-old backhand." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "I've never decked
a nine-year-old before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "but today could be the day." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never closed-line to anybody, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but man, you guys just
put on some distance" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So just to with them, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (foreign language) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> My nine-year-old mind was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'll show them." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, out loud to my sister. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I said, in Japanese, I said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> have you finished selecting
which one you want? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think my sister
quickly picked up on it too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I think she overheard it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And so she was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, I'll play you a game." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And back in Japanese, she was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, I've almost finished." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then she busted out this really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like specific Japanese reference. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And from my periphery, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd never seen a nine-year-old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a punk champ face in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "What?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You would have thought these kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would have seen like the face of God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh my God, what the fuck is that?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And just to fuck with them even further </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when we finished selecting our shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I purposely went towards the kids. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And as I passed by, I busted out a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (foreign language) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that was just like
the finishing brawl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That might as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I just clothes line them with my warriors. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even a death note asking counter- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll fucking kicked the fuck out of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's so much more like passive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than what I think I used to do to kids. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey slammed down a nine year old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with Japanese and language, swish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember we used to go camping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> every year in France for like three weeks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was, okay, you're
gonna think wild, Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're a violent like fucking 11 year old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking spent all my
time in the arcades. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember this one time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this kid had been taunting me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess French kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking hated him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even taunting me for like days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm playing Metal Slug. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know how you would
put like two credits in? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You press the credit button? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, I'm playing and I
put another one in for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I die, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this asshole, this 11 year old bitch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> comes along presses the
restart credit button, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then walks away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I immediately just turned around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just fucking smacked him in the face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got in so much trouble. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had like an angry
French dad shouting at me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like 11, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> His dad shouting at me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So this kid's crying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, I'm gonna finish my game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I'll deal with this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And my dad had such a fucking go at me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You were that X-Box kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which I definitely like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was such an angry kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've no idea why, but I'm glad though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause now I just can't
even get angry with- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - To be fair, I'd be
pretty pissed off too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If some random fucking kid
came up to me did that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, hen you were like 11, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is also, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my parents didn't give me much money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and I would always use
it on the games, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So to me, this kid has just
taken like the only money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was getting for like that whole trip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, oh no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We all know like two in 11 year old, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like two or three credits
or the little Slug </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the equivalency of mom's credit card. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I fucking love Metal Slug </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that kid took my credit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I can totally
understand why you got angry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I just thought, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> man, there's a few steps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between taking someone's credit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and smacking someone in face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He been giving me shit... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This kid have been giving me shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it's like a campsite. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He'd been giving me shit for days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I'm done, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm done.
I'm fuming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just straight up punched him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got so much shit for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then like two days later, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the same kid who I punched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> had a black eye, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he came while I was on
my other fucking game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just pulls out the plug
and I fucking chased him, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but he ran off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was gonna kill him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I was gonna fucking kill him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But he ran off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Motherfucker just pulled out the plug </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whilst I was mid Metal Slug. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even remember... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is going to be a weird question, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but when was the first time
you have a punched someone? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I got in so many fights in school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was that the first time
you ever punched someone? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you don't fight with... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh wait, do you only have a sister? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I only had a sister. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh dude, I have three brothers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude, if I punched my
sister, my dad would... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> My dad used to say this one threat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a legit threat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Where if I did anything like bad in public </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> he just grabbed my ear and
just whispered being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "I brought you into this world, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can easily take you out." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> My dad won't remember that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I specifically... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> To an eight year old that's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm sorry father." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Parenting 101, dad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Me and my brothers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so we had the three brothers, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it was WrestleMania, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like fucking constantly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I bet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I must have been in fist fights </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like three days of the week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Was actually fist fights or was it like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, we got to
the point we were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually start like full
on punching each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Holy shit, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We hated each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love them now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love you guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But back then it was like, fuck it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause Oh God, so many fights. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, my dad had this
thing we called it like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he's pretty gonna kill me if I say this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but he had the single, the murder stare. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And when you started fucking up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and he would look at you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and he's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Bro, you're one step away
from losing everything." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I will end you right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was the look where he was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Don't do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Don't do one more thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'll end you." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love you dad, by the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was an only child </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so I never had to grow
up with any siblings. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Never had to share anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, that was... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had a fairly uneventful
childhood because of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - In 2020, we call that privilege. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got bullied so much in school, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I just started just
fucking punching everyone back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if you get bullied at school, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you put a lot of pain at young age. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean that's when I
first started punching back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and actually get in fights. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> People just left me alone
'cause they knew if... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They would go for someone
else who wouldn't fight back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Should have just challenged
them to a chess game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I should've, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that would have definitely
worked to get the kids. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We'll play chess game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then the moment you
win and you just punch him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like double down on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Double check me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There so many times I
got in fights with kids. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what stories I could tell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you want any, I mean- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just trying to think when was the... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you ever punch anyone at school? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like full on punch someone? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For what reason? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because this kid in my- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's always dumbest fucking the school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's because this
kid in my high school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was giving me shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He was the bully of that year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But the thing is he was
that one bully that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know how some bullies
are kind of like popular </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with the kids that they don't bully </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this kid because he bullied everybody. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like every single person, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> everybody fucking hated this kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And of course eventually he the rounds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the next target was
me for whatever reason, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but and obviously going to a high school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's 99% white boys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm the only one with
a nonwhite bloodline. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course, he's going for blood. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's going for the
low-hanging fruit essentially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So he would say all these
late horribly racial slurs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at me and stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just one day he was just really... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I didn't mind the racial slurs, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's when he got up to my face- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hate that so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a difference between bully </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> shouting across the playground at you- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I don't mind that stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is fine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because that shit's easy to ignore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But respect my personal space. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the moment you cross
into my personal space, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's when the hands come out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I never punched anyone in
my life up until that point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, there's only one way
that this kid is gonna stop." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I gotta teach this kid a lesson. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And in my head I was doing a KG episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "If I punch him, I'm either going to die </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or I'm gonna come out of this alive." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey's like death-noting every action. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, this is like the total opposite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of the way I used to think about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, just punch
and figure it out later. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was always the person who was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Okay, what's gonna happen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if I go down this route?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like a visual novel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where I was like, punch or not punch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I don't wanna have to ban. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I don't wanna get the bad end, right?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was always like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a very good possibility that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if I punch I'm going to just like bad end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It just came over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "But this kid was just relentlessly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just shouting in my face and just like..." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the moment he started
pushing me around as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's when I think I just snapped. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I just weighed all back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just knock this kid in the chin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I threw the fucking barking move on him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> knocked him in the chin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he fell down on the ground </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and he just kind of walked off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then nobody in my year fucked with me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Okay, oh?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, that was a good end. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is more like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd never recommend fighting back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it can normally like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it can go like two ways, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can either fuck up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or everyone else will wanna challenge you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, you think you're hot shit? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "All right." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's like the start of a anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> " Oh, the nerd fall back?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Dude, there were kids who would like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spit on each other at school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was the stuff that
bothered me the most. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You can call me shit,
but don't spit on me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I hated high school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you guys have this, I don't know if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is only an Australian
high school thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but the last year of 12th grade, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally the day before graduation, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I forgot what it was called. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it was called like G12 free day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where basically the 12th graders </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the last day of high school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they can just run around the school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and do whatever the fuck they want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think we had something
similar in our school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You guys didn't have that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like our school took
that free day literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where some fucking
crazy shit would happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We somehow... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It started off quite innocently, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like putting lube all over the stair rails </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that so
people would slip on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And another one was going into
one of the teacher's offices </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and filling his entire flow
with cups full of water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So that he could like go into his... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then it got too far when one of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was like a group of boys, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they got one of the teachers' cars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I don't know how the they did it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was driving a mini. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was like relatively small car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they somehow put the car </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on top of one of the school buildings, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like on the roof. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I mean, that's too far </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's just sounds impressive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, the engineering. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> These kids going places. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wasn't there to witness it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but imagine just walking to school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're walking along the school wall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you just look up and there's
just a car sitting there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Huh, how did that get there?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This must have been in
the news or some shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Non, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is quite frequent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds like a
scene from some American- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Frequent? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What do you mean frequent? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This sounds like a scene </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from some American high school movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that you watch and you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, this is so fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "This will never happen in real life." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if my high
school still does it, but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's newsworthy in the UK, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That would be, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even the goal schools would go crazy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that as well just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> We didn't have any of this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it was the last,
last day of high school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's like, do whatever the
fuck you want while you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because after this day you
have adult responsibility. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's the Miley Cyrus effect, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, just get
all that out of the way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> once the contract has ended
and you're good to go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like I said, he must've
learned some good skills </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from being able to fucking
get a mini on a school roof. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How would you do that even if- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It wasn't like a multi-story building, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like a demountable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was just getting it up, but still. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - How? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Did like eight of them
coordinate this lift? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wasn't there to witness
it, but it was awesome </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just staring across the school grounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and seeing a fucking mini
on top of a demountable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That was crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - How do you convince kids to join, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> " Yeah, so we gonna go
lift the teachers mini. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, you down?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "I need like five boys who's in." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "All right, let's fucking do it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Speaking of like high school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> why is there so many high school anime? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow, that transition gone, damn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was just mad- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Holy shit, he's on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm fucking on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's the deal with high school anime? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What's the deal with high school anime? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because that sounds crazier </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> than any fucking high school anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I've ever heard of- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, some crazy
high school anime out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's either one or two ways. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's either like the most vanilla- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you guys have school
festivals in your high school? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like how they have in Japan? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's only Japanese
high school thing, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - In Japan, they make school looks so fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And British school are the
most depressing shit on earth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no, I like it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - They don't do anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You guys are here telling
your high school stories. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't remember a fuck.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember fuck off my high school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - All I remember is bad, bad, bad things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - See, people always say
that, I think I like the 1% </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that actually had a good
time in high school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I had a good... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I liked my friend group a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I had those four of us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and we were all really close, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but stuff that happened in
school was just always awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like it was what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I got in so many fights as a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like there was one time as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this is one story I remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this drove my blood
life through the roof, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So there's a day in the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if you do this in Australia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where the kids who are
coming into high school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get like two days in like June, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before September starts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where they get to just
come and see the school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And my little brother
was coming up, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, like an orientation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was showing my little brother around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm one of the guys just, the bullies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just comes up to me while I'm
talking to my little brother </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just slaps me in the face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just slapped me in the face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'd already been in
multiple fights at this point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And me, I get slapped down like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, it's go time." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The hands are coming out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You slapped me first. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not gonna get in
shit now if I beat you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I started fighting him and I- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - In front of your little brother? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is so weird to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In what world is this just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - He literally- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Does this thing just happen? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally just slaps me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Wait there." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was thinking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've got to show my little brother </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not a pussy, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's my little brother. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He looks up to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've got to show him I'm not a bitch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause if he see we get
slapped and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, sorry, sorry." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's gonna think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Wow, my big brother is kind of wimp. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> " What's up with that?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It sounds like a inbetweeners
episode or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is, because then it
turns to a tournament arc </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where then all his friends
the next day we're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh well, we want to turn now." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And there was one time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this is pretty the
one where I felt most bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that this guy came up to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like kind of chubby and I thought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What are you doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What are you doing, man? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What's up with this?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He pushes me once. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, fine." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I grabbed his head and
just fucking knee him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Bear in mind... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, I do not do not condone
violence in any sense, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I loved it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was such an angry 13 year old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I was getting bullied since like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You were 13 when you did this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- What the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You weren't even in high school, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you were like middle school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, not like 13, like 15, 14, maybe 15. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, still. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 15, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then this guy didn't... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never had a problem with this guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't realize why
he was doing this to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I think I pissed
off one of his friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then he was trying to act big. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think he actually wanted to fight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> He was just pushing me
around, but I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Fuck it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Anyway, so I did that and he
just dropped and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think I did it that hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just thought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I saw it in a movie once it
looked really fucking cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw him do it once, I can do it too." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Who gets hurt by getting
kneeled in the face?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he's smaller than me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So he pushed me and then I
think I was gonna go push, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just went like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he just dropped for like five seconds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, shit, are you okay?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, yeah, I'm fine." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think he was so embarrassed,
he didn't tell anyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then he came in the
next day, two black eyes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, how did he get to two black eyes? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How wide is your kneel? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I feel like I hit right here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was gonna say- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So he came in with two black eyes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Didn't tell anyone, but all
my friends knew what happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No one said anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like that one week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where I had like three fights, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No one did anything for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The rest of my school life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone was nice to me after that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You had more fights in that one week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than I think I have in my entire life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I had more
fights in that one week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> than anyone else- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like fight club. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - In my school it wasn't
about getting into fights. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was about who did you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you're cool with X person, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're cool with that person,
he wouldn't fuck with you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if it's 'cause
it's like a small town thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It was such a small town thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and where the teachers often
forgave the shitty behavior </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause more often than not
all the teachers were friends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the kids' parents, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it was kind of a thing of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, don't do it again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Don't do it again." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You need someone in the face- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every single time it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Don't do it again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Don't do it again." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There wasn't a proper punishment? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it is what it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really care now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I dealt with it myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you go to a boy's school? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So maybe that's the aspect of it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I feel that boys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> will be more willing to get into fights </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it's a coed school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they're trying
to impress the girls. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I never wanted to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just wanted to play my games and be- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but it just seems
like fucking fight club. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, it was fucking awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I joke about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I remember hating
it when I was in school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I probably fucking hate
it too if it was that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I remember there was
one guy who would like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> He didn't wanna fight me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He didn't want to fight me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think he knew that he'd get hurt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So he would just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like I said, he would spit on me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and anytime I tried to like
fight him, he just run away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what can I do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like that one asshole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who like kites amazingly, he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Come to me." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - His torn games like on point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And he'd just kite you and he- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He was just kitting me, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Fucking stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Stop" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Actually he'd run to
an area with teachers, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I can't fucking punch
him in front of a teacher. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - He'd make a amazing ADC anime, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> He'd make a great one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I swear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm behind, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Me fight? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Don't think?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like no, I wouldn't... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, if any 13 year old,
14 old kids, don't fight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not a good solution. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not worthy it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I was just lucky </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I was freakishly strong
for a 12, 13 year old as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That helped a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, 'cause for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've always gone through life being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, physical interaction
is always my last choice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have that now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But as a kid, I felt like
it was my only, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You went the hard way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean, I'm glad
that I was angry as a kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause now I have like zero anger at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I never get angry about shit now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm so glad that I just
got that shit out, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if that's how anger works. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if this is science. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not sure about that, it's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I feel like 'cause
I've dealt with so much anger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my past I've been able to really, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking channel it right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like filled your
anger quota of life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> during your teens, and it's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I'm run dry now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I genuinely think I have that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, I don't feel- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just go down the system now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get like mildly frustrated at things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like a British person would, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but I never get angry at things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mildly frustrated is just the British... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's just the default British emotion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Anything can be mildly frustrate you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's just the way
we've just grown up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll be angry about shit now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'll be like angry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I play it up 'cause I liked your shouting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but is like the chillest man on earth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it's impossible to get mad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never actually seen you mad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I mean that's the
whole monk thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you want to talk about it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have we talked about that in a podcast? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess I got to tell the story now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was a smooth
transition, you see that boys? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm gonna get to the toilet before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He needs to santa up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (foreign language) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn that was- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Am I watching an anime right now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Damn, son. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What are we talking about today, Joe? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're talking about
two particular series </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that Book Walker is
releasing on their website. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if you've
heard of it, Connor? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure Garnt you've heard of
it, but there is two series. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> There's one called TenPuru, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is about a temple. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Surprise, surprise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - With a monk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With a monk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Perfect segue into the
next part of the show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But also the other one is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (foreign language) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I don't know what
the English title of is- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why the Hell Are You Here Teacher? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've seen episode one of this show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my goodness gracious
that is not Christian, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm so glad I can
read it on Book Walker </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the comfort of my home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes, 'cause on Book Walker, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the manga is completely uncensored. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You get full nibs and everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> If you've ever thought about
getting with your teacher. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's basically the show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's basically the manga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I need no more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You might need more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the other manga that
they have it is TenPuru, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is illustrated by the same guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> No, sorry, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Illustrated by the same
guy who did Grand Blue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know Grand Blue? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do know Grand Blue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so illustrated
by the complete same guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just different writer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But essentially as the name
suggests it's about this kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who has these really dirty thoughts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but he wants to be a good Christian. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So he basically goes to it a temple </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get rid of this horny
on main Christian thoughts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the problem is is
that he becomes a monk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at a temple that is full of hot women. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That doesn't sound very monkly to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't happen to you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanna be a monk, I swear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This was the real
reason I became the monk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hoping for that scenario. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's sounds pretty good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the thing is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's illustrated by the same guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to Grand Blue, the type of comedy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is exactly the same as Grand Blue. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you love the like really vulgar visual </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that really made Grand Blue funny, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> TenPuru is exactly the same way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And the added bonus is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's way more hot girls ain
TenPuru than Grand Blue so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Guys, I'm getting some breaking
news from Book Walker here </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know if my
penis can handle that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How can it get extra ecchi? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's the extraness in the ecchiness? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's that the skin is colored this time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not as black and white. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If that sounds remotely
interesting to you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can check it out in the link below. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> Thank you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Back to the video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah, it's a little known secrets </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or it's a little known fact
that I've been a monk in my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I've not just been a monk once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just saying that is so cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - To me, this is just
part of Buddhist culture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So in Buddhist culture,
normally when you want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give your family like good karma, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone in my family has been a monk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like twice in their life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Once when they're a teenager. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And once when they're like an adult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So you become a monk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> once when you're like a teenager. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We call that (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you become a full
monk when you become an adult </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's when you kind
of hit like your early 20s. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So yeah, so normally a lot
of people would just do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like one or two days </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause we believe that it's good karma. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember when I was about 12 or 13 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was a monk for two weeks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then afterwards,
when I was about 22, 23 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was a monk for a full month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jeez. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause you told me stories about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how you are a monk for an entire month </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I never knew that you did it twice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, to me it's just part
of like being a Buddhist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and trying to get... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was that good little Asian kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was trying to give like my family </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good karma and everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I honestly liked the experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it was... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not joking when it was literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the life changing experience for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was me before being a monk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then there's me after being a monk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because normally people would
just do it just to impress </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> their family and just give
their family a good karma. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I told my mom, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I'm gonna do it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna go all the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> There's some temples that you go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to that don't take it as seriously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I went to a
fucking hardcore temple </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where we didn't have any
technology, we had to... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, so here here's my daily schedule. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So I would have to wake
up at around 4:00 AM. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That already sounds like torture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That already sounds like torture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have to be ready, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to be completely ready by five. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we didn't have any beds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We had a concrete floor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and one little pillow to sleep on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And we had the thinnest
blanket in the world, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which wasn't so bad 'cause it's Thailand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But when sometimes when you're sleeping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the middle of the forest, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause there would be
times when we just go out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to your temple in the
middle of the forest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can get fucking cold. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The temperature drops </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to about two or three degrees sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And you just have this
like tiny little blanket </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> on a concrete floor to keep you warm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So we'd have to wake up by
four, get ready by five. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then we just be like
meditating and praying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a good two, three hours every day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then afterwards we
would basically go out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> barefoot, go to whatever village </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever area around the temple. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And people would just
donate the food to... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> We would carry like these
little baskets on our necks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and people would come over
and they would donate food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever they wanna
donate because we believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that if you give two a monk,
that's a good karma as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So the food that we got donated,
that's what we would eat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So we would walk around for a few hours- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The entire day? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, For the entire day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you get a lot of it or
was it like just enough or? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, you get what you're given. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have no choice about
what you could eat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You could eat basically
what you were given. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Did you ever get anything
like super nasty? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I mean, it's- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - In the mindset, you're
not like picky and like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "A Snickers? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Really?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because the whole
point of being a monk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is that you live- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't care.
- You don't care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You eat to survive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess if you're caring
about that that's like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the feet and
the point of being a monk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you get what you're given </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you live the simplest life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can possibly live and
you basically eat to survive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and you get one meal a day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you gotta be okay with
whatever you get given. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we would eat at around 11 to 12 o'clock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and that would be our
first and only meal a day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It was easier when you're a kid monk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause kid monks would
get two meals a day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But when you're grown. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, when you're adult </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're more grown up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> burning more calories,
no you got to survive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on one meal a day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And afterwards you could... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There was no cheesing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So after that you couldn't have any milk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or any like liquids that had calories </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you could only have water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or some kinds of fruit juices. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that was it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, yeah, It was very... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know really how to
describe the experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause imagine if you just take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every distraction out of your life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you just live the
simplest life possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't eat to enjoy your food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't really get the pleasures in life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but at the same time, you just kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're okay with everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you have to be
okay with everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember for the
first week of being a monk, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's fucking hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is so fucking hard
to reprogram your brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to not only be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, how do I distract
myself with my phone? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "How do I not check Twitter? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "How do I not watch YouTube videos? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "How do I just be okay
with my own thoughts?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's so hard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because nowadays your brain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> constantly looks forward to something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It constantly needs
something to distract itself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the first week I was just kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a drug addict, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I should have tweaked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Give me a tweak </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sitting there trying to meditate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and my mind just going out
a million miles an hour. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I haven't watched TV in a week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I haven't seen a screen in a week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's very, very difficult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the more time you do it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the more you kind of you realize that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, these are all just distractions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can be completely
okay with just yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and your own thoughts and
just doing the simplest things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and life activities. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then when I got to that point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I kind of just had time to
just reflect on my entire life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause what else are you gonna fucking do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you have nothing to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but literally think back
about every decision </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you've made in your life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And the way your mind works, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know when sometimes you're
lying in bed at 11:00 AM </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and your brain reminds you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about the embarrassing thing
you did when you were 12 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or maybe by that time when
you punched a fucking kid? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I gotta- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So just imagine your
entire day just being that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Ah, I wonder if I'd made the right choice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "at this point in my life." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then what happened to me was that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I kind of just reflected
on every little decision </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that kind of led me up
to this point in my life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And what it made me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what it forced me to do was really think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Huh, am I really happy
about where I am now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What's my life gonna be like
when this monk had ends?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was at a really bad point in my life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before I became a monk, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is kind of why I
really wanted to commit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the facts of being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I was gonna be a monk,
I'm gonna go all the way, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get the full detox, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I've seen some temples, you walk in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they have like a 50 inch flat screen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Does this-" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The monk channel only. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We only have the monk channel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This doesn't seem very monkly to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We accept PayPal transactions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's on the TV, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on it's like a live stream
of a different temple </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and then French. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nice, nice content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it forced me to just
reflect on my entire life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it forced me to really think about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what I wanted to do
after my monkhood ended. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it was truly a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to say fucking... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a spiritual journey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I really just discovered myself- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I think in this instance you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it nearly sounds like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It kind of was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, it's- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just like me when I go to the toilet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without my phone, I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm free" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because people have talked to me about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> how they've had similar experiences </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they just shut off social media </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't even know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You won't even know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> " Bruh, you don't even know." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Get on my level. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get on my level, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You didn't have any board games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You didn't have any cards
to just play around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All you just had was just yourself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I can't really
convey how alien that is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was alien for me as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is a part of
me that just a vision, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause as you said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the only thing you had was
just yourself and your mind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And all I could imagine
was just, a monk guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just sitting there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just thinking of a funny
jokes in the locker room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That totally happened as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When I was a monk, that's
when I thought about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "There's a series I wanna
make called Anime in Minutes." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you serious right now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm totally serious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm totally serious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That came to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember the exact moment, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I was just walking around, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm walking around one
of the Thai villages </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it just fucking came to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I remember last, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not last week but a few weeks ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I talked about being Zen on
the fucking toilet in a shower. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So that was I kind of... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes when I'm just walking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just zoning out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes I've reached this point when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of ideas just come to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it came to me when
I was a monk as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I got a lot of video ideas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and a lot of ideas when I was a monk, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> which it was these ideas when I was a monk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that have developed to me
to my comeback on YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I figured out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, if I'm gonna come back on YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how was I gonna come back on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, this has been a
very closely guarded secret </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there were some YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some very odd YouTube clips </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm just wearing a beanie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And nobody knows why I'm
just wearing a beanie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was because I had
just finished my monkhood </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was just completely bold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What if they just like took
it in a really dark direction? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh no, the cancer treatment." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, how do you sign up to be a monk? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it like a Facebook group, you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> " I wanna be a monk." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you just rock up and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Yo, let's do it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean you just
turn up to whatever temple </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you want to become a monk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, you go to the head monk
and you request to be a monk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they ask, okay,
before you become a monk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you need to make sure you
have no outstanding debts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You basically, you've got to
give up or material connections </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to the world before you can
commit to becoming a monk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you'll have this
interview now you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, if you're gonna become a monk, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you got to do this, do this, do this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what would
be a really cool idea </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for this channel is if
like us three somehow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> went to a temple here and
just like experienced it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like a single that day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Wow, I was just already on that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Hey, if you guys would like to see that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Monk episode when? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Monk episode, like Garnt could be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like head monk of trash taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We have to shave our heads. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you realize that, Joey? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just noticed that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can commit to that, you can't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't commit to that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll just wear the beanie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I don't really talk about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but now by now that I am, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I do like highly recommend
that kind of experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So or just do it doing
that kind of experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you don't notice
how distracting life is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't realize that
as soon as you wake up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've got things to occupy your mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You got your job or you got, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first thing you do
is you check Twitter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> open Arknights and you
don't know how crazy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your mind can be sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, you've literally
remove every distraction, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every commitments that you need
to do from your daily life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you just have nothing
'cause it's just a void, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're just giving you life a void. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And because you give your life a void, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it fucking changes you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how else I can- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I totally get that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Back when I was still doing YouTube stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I went on this like camping trip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with a few of my friends
and we went to this area </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that had absolutely no
reception whatsoever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, Wales? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we went all the way to Wales. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, we were just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in the butt fuck middle
of nowhere in Australia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with no reception. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we would just went camping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And because there's no reception,
I couldn't shake anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I couldn't like message you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is like a lite version. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's basically just like
dieting, diet version of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But I kind of had like a
similar experience with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But only like for that one day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I remember the first couple of hours, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking hated it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was just, I was
getting those like drugs like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "I need to know who liked my tweet." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But after a while, when
I hit around midday, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I eventually was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "This is actually really nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "The world is beautiful." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why I love going to the cinema. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> No one can like, be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Why don't you answer your phone?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In every other situation, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, you should have answered still." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But in the cinema for some reason, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Understandable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Have a nice day." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You ignored my texts for three hours" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Understandable." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're just like a void. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's great, I love it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just literally ignore the world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> for like three hours and just have fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and that's why
it frustrates me when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the void gets pulled back to reality </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when someone in the back
is just fucking shouting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, yeah, I forgot this is reality." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I hate it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because especially now I think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know the Internet's
I feel like has reprogrammed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> my brain in a way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't remember, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if I just have ADHD </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because I didn't always felt like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was this easily distracted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like subconsciously
building patents </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in your head thou. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You've trained your brain
to check Twitter constantly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you will have that moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm sure you've all had it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where you're like you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> open Twitter, you close Twitter
and you open Twitter again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Why did I open Twitter again?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I literally just refreshed
my feed like two seconds ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't wanna to do this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I just didn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You check Twitter on your computer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you realize there's nothing to changed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you close and you
immediately checking your phone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Why am I doing this?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I wasted ten seconds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the same as course
as going to the fridge, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see nothing, then closing it,
sitting on back on the couch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then five minutes later
then go to the fridge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like food's gonna
magically appear in the fridge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, I mean, it was an
awesome experience to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't, if that's not something that's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not an experience for everyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The question is though,
would you do it again? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would do it again possibly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe not to this extreme </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I feel like I'm in a
lot better place in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm a lot more privileged. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I mean, not just that, but mentally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm in a lot better
place in my life as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I don't feel, I would need
to go to that extreme again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but would I want an experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I just kind of just
remove myself from the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just give myself- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, just like a short detox. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a detoxing the mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's how I feel it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I highly recommend people doing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It sounds really cheesy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because people will always think of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like some crazy California- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Gap year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I took a gap year to Thailand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Shut up, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You probably went to the club every night. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Shut up." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that's why I don't
really like to talk about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because whenever you say,
yeah, I've been a monk- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It sounds pretentious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It sounds pretentious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> People give you that look to be like, why- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause it makes it sound like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like a vacation for you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> whereas it was pretty, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why it sounds pretentious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or maybe it sounds like it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because maybe some people
think you just went through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> adjust to brag about it later on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The fact that you don't
really talk about this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never talk about this- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember I dragged that
conversation out of you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but we were really drunk in Singapore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like three years ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I just drunkenly
offhanded mentioned it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hold on, you were a monk?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Were you ever angry
before you were a monk? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I swear, I've
never seen you angry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's up with that, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I've been angry before, but- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't get... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Even when you're angry, I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dude, I don't know if you're
angry, angry or maybe- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, being a monk just taught me how to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think about the whole process. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Basically, process everything, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause when you just kind
of empty your mind part of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the commitment we tried to make is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we tried to learn how we
process our way of thinking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you gotta kind of... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So the way I see it, it's
kind of like a logic tree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And this is what happened
to me when I was a monk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where I'd feel certain
emotions I need to have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like logically think be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Why am I feeling this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How did this come? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you kind of learned the roots </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of basically all your
emotions and just anger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then through that I just on the fly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I learned how to deal with my anger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would find another route to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, before I get angry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe I could try dealing
it with another way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is why I've rarely get angry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Some people get angry
very easily but for me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not that I don't get angry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that I just have
different ways of dealing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about it than shouting or fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just love shouting, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't punch anyone anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's old Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Old Connor's gone, new Connor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he just West coast it and shouts loudly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love shouting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> When I shout, I fucking love shouting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know why shouting is so fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So is the deal like purposely shout </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to just get that frustration
out before it turns </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into legit anger or? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes if I'm like
real angry some days, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or I wake up and I'm upset, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll just go in the
mirror and I'll be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Come on." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I only see that in movies, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I wouldn't be surprised if
you're the kind of person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who just punches the pillow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's get all the frustration out, but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just imagined you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in the fucking morning every morning- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like in the mirror, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You got this Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You got this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "You fucking got this." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, some days you wake up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you'll feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Man, I'm kind of feeling
shitty today, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't know why, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm kind of worthless." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I get in front of that mirror, I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You can do this." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My neighbors probably hate me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck it, I'm hype. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm ready for the day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That energy rushes through you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like a 10 immediately. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so monkey but I love it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like a 10 straight
away to start my day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Question for you guys, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how did you guys hype yourself up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before recording session for your videos? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause there's gonna be a time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> This is the thing that... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think this is because
you've just recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> started doing it a lot, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I remember when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I first started filming my face a lot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking dreaded doing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did everything to avoid it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would shave like three times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just to make sure it
was perfect in my head, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but really what I was
doing with delaying it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Maybe I need to go get
the groceries actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "I should do laundry actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, its too late vocal record now." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't record 'cause I was too busy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> renovating my house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But now I just turn it on and do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't have to think about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't really hype myself up- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have a coffee, maybe
a red bull if I need it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, caffeine helps definitely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I don't really have like a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Do it face." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - In the morning, if you're
feeling down man, try it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Next time you feel sad when you wake up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it happens sometime, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You just feel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just try it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You'll feel like an idiot at first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but then you'll be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Nice dude." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's gonna clown on me the entire day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was about to say,
Sydney gonna be like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess since no one lives with me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you can do it by yourself, but if- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sydney's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Garnt, what're doing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Why you saying, come on?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't let your dreams take you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Come. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, come, come. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've realized I'm slowly
forming a profile for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of just like a complete
monkey on this one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think only hyping up by doing maybe, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes because I'm not
going to even think about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> recording a video, if I'm
already not in that state. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I've realized </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just don't film if you're not in the mood. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, before I used to have to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, I have to fucking
record something." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I would turn the camera on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And immediately, the moment
you hit that record button, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Fuck man, I don't wanna do it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I hate my life right now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Not today." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I didn't have a choice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I was uploading
every two days or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But with my current schedule </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now I have a little bit levity in that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just know if I wake up in the morning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and today's the day where I
can just get something out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because if I feel good already </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from the morning, then I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, it's time to
get that bread game is late. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Let's let's record like three videos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Just get that shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> while the fucking wild
hype train is running." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes playing hype
music will get me in the zone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just a nice funk, then
those beats they hit you- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, like power of music, man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that shit can easily hype enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How'd you know what
music to pick, Connor? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How'd you know what music to pick? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I let YouTube decide for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do I go with slow beat or fast beat? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fast song, happy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - YouTube search history
for music is just like an AI </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to understand
what the emotions are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is how my music tastes
works and how I find songs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I like one song </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I'll just keep letting
YouTube suggest me songs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'll keep building. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I never actively look out for songs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just let it suggest it the songs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like YouTube and
Spotify recommendations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> were built for people like you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh dude, they're amazing, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's really fucking good thou, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was diehard Spotify for
like six years, maybe longer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I just tried YouTube music once </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I had it with
premium and I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Holy shit, I think I like this more." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh dude, but I've
discovered so much good music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on Spotify on recommended. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think both. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause there's a lot of songs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that aren't official </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you'll get on YouTube music, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the like remixes that
will never be on Spotify </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause they wouldn't- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't really give
a shit about the remix- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There so many good ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's like one where it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the Sono Chino Sadame </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> makes for like that 90 song by
like Diana Ross or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That shit claps, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, I'll send you a link. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's always the good anime remixes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, there are so
many good anime remixes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on YouTube that you're
not allowed on Spotify. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes I want to
listen to like Daft Punk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But I also want to have
that animates remixes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I can do that on YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Hell, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, I've recently kind
of gone into the rabbit hole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of these insane like music remixes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and not just like anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously you know the anime remixes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like everyone's seen
the Renai Circulation, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which has Snoop Dogg or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But my friend sent me one the other day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is fucking insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was September by Earth, Wind & Fire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> remixed with Crazy Train by Ozzy Osbourne. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can remix that song
with anything though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but it sounded fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh my God, I need more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "I need more." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have never seen an Earth,
Wind & Fire remix, September. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They disappoint me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Except for the Taylor Swift
and that was terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But Earth, Wind & Fire
goes with everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Wii Show one, have you seen that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro, that shit that collapsed, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I will get a copyright. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Damn that was too perfect." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That was kind of own pitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Connor was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Did I get off pitch there." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've recently fallen
into the rabbit hole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of just listening to J-pop that's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> They sound like anime opening
and endings, but they're not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like Polkadot Stingray? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah like Polkadot Stingray, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Zutomayo, Minami it's- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so many. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the rabbit hole, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You discover one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The algorithm is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, you like this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, hello, let me show you more." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's gotten so deep right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That recently I was recommended a video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which it was kind of like
a vocaloid kind of remix </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think it was original song </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the video had no title </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the channel had no title
and then I click on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah so it's not even like
they have a space or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, there's just literally
no character for the title. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Apparently you can. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a thing called like
a Hoff Hoff space or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a space that is
technically a character </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it doesn't show up as anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't like highlight it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and copy and paste into the search bar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no interaction
with whatever character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're putting down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So the only way people would have got this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is through recommendations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the video has like two million views. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I click on it
and then everyone's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, welcome to the cult." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing)
- Join us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I see you have been the chosen one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's great because like they're probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna kill me now because
everyone's like mutually agreed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not to talk about this which... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sorry guys, I guess the
entire internet knows now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, I'm not gonna link to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> If you're part of the chosen
like show me a message. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I see anyone linking
it we'll fucking bun you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You played me this in your house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was just hoping one day
would pop up in my record. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Still waiting, still waiting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like Illumina argument. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You just got to wait for that email. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cook some more crappy vocal
and can I get a pop up dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, but that's just the
wonders of the algorithm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I have no idea
how the algorithm works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay going completely off topic here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But there's been one
video of mine recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just been getting
recommended to everyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I have no idea why it's
an eight year old video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we've not talked
about on this podcast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So many people have tweeted us about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so there's been a video recently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's been circulating that's called... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Recently at the time of filming? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah recently at the time of filming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it might still be
circulating, talking about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's probably gonna start getting stuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I should probably circle back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the start of animetube itself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You guys are about to
get history lesson here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Go on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So do you guys know who the
very first Animetuber is? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought it was Mr. Anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That was my preconception. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd be surprised if
anyone watching this knew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because that means you've
been around for as long as me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the very first anime
YouTuber is this guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> called Hards Anime Reviews. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he started in 2006 and
he would just basically make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> very basic animal reviews with like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> his camera was like up here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Worst angle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah was like kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the worst angle you can think of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The angle we all start at, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And he's now quit it's funny because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I tried to search him up and
see if he's still around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And his first original
channel got terminated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as everyone's dead back then
when they were reviewing anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and his second channel is called </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> un ironically the Hard Mode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He called it the Hard Mode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you search this up on YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to search the
Hard Mode, no space. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Otherwise you're not gonna find it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause it's like that buried
within the search algorithm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But the second animetuber
was this person called </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Mr. Anime and he basically made his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> anime YouTube channel to compete with Hard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause Hard was the only
anime YouTube channel around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then Mr. Anime was the second one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he really, at the time he really was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the big faces of anime YouTube. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I say big, he had
like a 1,000 subscribers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That big shit back in the day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is big shit back in 2006, 2007. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then it was after
Mr.Anime that there were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> some other anime channels here and there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but those two are the
founding fathers of animetube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We have them to thank for
where we are now basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - If people know the ending to the story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you know how funny
that statement is know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So then after a while I
made my YouTube channel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I do my own thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And the very, very first shout out I got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was from a Mr.Anime
video and it's still up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's video, is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's it's Mr.Anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, is his channel still up? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, his channel is still up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You can view his entire history
and everything that he did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow that's weird because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was that guy recently
got prosecuted for like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> child pornography and they took
down his channel like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah that Austin guy the singing guy... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Picture on screen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They immediately took down his channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember a couple
months ago a Mr.Anime video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like popped up just randomly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, yeah, yeah, so Mr. Anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first time he shouted me out was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he made a video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it was called like
the face of Animetuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or something and he
just shouted out a bunch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of OG anime reviews back in the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What a nice was is that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So that was the very first
boost in subscribers I got. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember messaging him being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh thanks a lot, man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "dude like that they're
really helps me out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I got me like 300 subscribers." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, holy shit, that was
a lot back in that day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that was the video that pushed me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> over my first 1000 subscribers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which was a big fucking deal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was really happy and
I really respected the guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as well because if not for him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd probably be less
confident to do what I did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like to start my YouTube channel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and especially no matter
what whenever you see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone bigger than you shouting you out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's like a big pat on the back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he messaged me back being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Nah, it's no problem, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I just really like your stuff congrats." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> He couldn't even pronounce
my name back then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think in the video
he called me guy geek. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't say that now there
are gonna call you guy geek. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've dug my own grave. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So that was the last kind of interaction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had with him until- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was the first and last interaction? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah that was my first
and last interaction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Back then the anime
YouTube community wasn't... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> We knew we bought each other, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but we didn't talk to
each other that much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like the MSM days? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, so there wasn't an easy
way to talk to each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Apart from back when
YouTube had messaging. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Remember those days? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - YouTube DMs which were slowly just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> phased out of existence, I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And just nobody remembers that you could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> DM people on YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but one day I just woke
up and I had this message </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> from this other anime
YouTuber who was called </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ICO Ari soccer 420 who's also like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You remember that right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I know the entire
history of anime YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right here, right here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - He asked me if I'd
heard about this article, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's been like linked around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was this article
that was this police report </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that basically just said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Trey Sesler has been arrested
for the murdering his family. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Whoa, is this Trey Sesler, the anime man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "The same Trey Sesler?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I am Trey Sesler. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We got him first. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck I've just blanked
his actual name now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> All that's coming to mind is the anime- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mr.Anime.
- Mr.Anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't believe I blanked
on the name mid-story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why did you doubt me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I clicked on the article
and he had his face </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that was just the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh shit, is this real?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had like 50 different emotions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I kind of imagine how it feels. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just to see him because you don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> how to react to this
because the more I read, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just the more sickening it got. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So the entire story was that apparently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Trey Sesler, Mr.Anime
had been playing around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> with his brother and they
were playing around with guns- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - As they did in his channel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> See he had a lot of guns in
like his channel and everything, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but me back then I just think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Americans guns that's just what they do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what British people
think about Americans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Unless you think Americans
just walk around and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hey waving with guns. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - So he would just have
guns in his anime reviews </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just thought that
was completely normal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause he was from Texas
as well and I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is completely normal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> This is nothing to worry about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought there's a
text and watch the shooter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with that gun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even now I see a texting with a gun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just think that's even normal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even after everything I've
just about to experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I read the story and
he was playing around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with this guns with his brother </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and apparently he
accidentally shot his brother </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he killed him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so the official story that he gave was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he didn't want his parents
to feel guilt or his family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to feel guilt about having their son </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kill one of their brothers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So apparently he just thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> might as well fucking
kill them all which is- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a fucking awful thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is a awful conclusion to come to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So apparently he kills his entire family </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it gets worse because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the more information that comes out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the more we find out that he was actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not only planning to kill
his family anyway but he was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually planning a
Columbine-Style school shooting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause I saw like
this really good documentary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> on YouTube I'm sure it's up there still. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - ReignBot, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I think so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's basically covers the whole thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but that's how I got all
my information as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where he was planning
to do a school shooting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and did he post about it online
that he was going to do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like that but basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was on the way to the school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's when he got arrested. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause he was planning
the school shooting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for way before he's killed his family. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I think how he thought was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he killed his brother by accident, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but he was always planning
the school shooting anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He had it all mapped out and everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So in between that he accidentally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> killed his brother and killed his family. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's what outed him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But he was always planning this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's this really ominous video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's the second
to last, Mr. Anime video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this on a channel that's just called </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mr. Anime is planning something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember watching that thinking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "He's taken a break from any Animetube." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or he's planning a new reveal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's planing a comeback. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I dunno 'cause he talks
about anime in that video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So he might've been just
purely talking about anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by I'm like with all the information </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we have now he's probably- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That title was fucking scary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's fucked, that title was fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the more information that came out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the more I just didn't
know how to process this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause how would you process the fact that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the people you
looked up to and respected </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just killed their family
and was planning to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shoot up a fucking school? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like what what'd you do with that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That bothered me for a while. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember this was the
time I was at university </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and people were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Why does Garnt look like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "someone just died in
his family or something?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I think the best
way I can describe it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine if you like live in a small town </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you may be like you know
everyone in this small town </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you might not be friends with
everyone in that small town </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you feel like this
small, tight knit community. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you find that
someone in this small </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tiny community has done something awful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like something that's
not like beyond words </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beyond words, awful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then to try to process
this I made the video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is being recommended now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's circulating everywhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even though it's eight years old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason YouTube decided, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah people wanna see Garnt reacting to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Mr.Anime murdering his family." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno how that came about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally on
everyone's recommended, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was on my recommended, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think Connor was on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know why it's
probably not monetize, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no it's not monitized. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It just goes against everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about the YouTube algorithms
like it's not monetized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's about a horrible tragedy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's about a very sensitive topic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean it was eight years old. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I uploaded this before even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the monetization thing
like started on YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or at least before I was monetized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I had like a
1,000 plus subscribers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it wasn't massive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember stumbling
upon a Mr. Anime video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> even like way before I
knew about the whole like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime YouTube hemisphere
and everything because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was Mr. Anime review on Garnt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that made me wanna go watch Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That guy has got a bright career. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Wow, this guy is like really fun." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He fucking had... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you know how ghetto his set up was? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> He had like a webcam
or something to record. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was sitting on his bed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and he had his lap and
it was like a notepad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> almost like an Apple- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - An Apple notepad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - An Apple notepad of the script. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was literally just
looking down at the Apple notepad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just reading off the script </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then every now and then I guess, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because he didn't know
how to edit these videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So instead he had a remote that controlled </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the zoom of the lens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> He control the zoom with the lens </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just started talking to the camera </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then he just zoomed back out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, no cuts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So he was like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember in the Garnt
review he was talking about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the acid scene in the Garnt
anime and how he was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "It made me go." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then he stops and zooms in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and zooms really far into
his face and he goes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fuck." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then he zooms out with a dead face </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just goes back to reading it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that was the review. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No cots, no edits. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah I wanna watch this anime." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that was quality content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> back in the day of animetube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember when I started
coming out with my videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was one of the first to actually just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> use an editing software, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though it was just
putting images over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever I was say people were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "He's using windows movie maker? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Impossible." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah that's the story
of the first person I ever- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Humble beginnings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I recommend like as
of a topic that is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I definitely recommend that
documentary on YouTube- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It perfectly goes through
everything about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And at the end of the documentary, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how they got this footage, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but there's this- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh the police footage? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The police footage of
how he's like the jail cell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> during the interview,
that shit is so scary man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And to think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is the guy who founded </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "basically what I do for a living." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like that's so fucking scary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so weird 'cause
I've had this conversation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a few people and we just think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "There's a lot of shit
that's happened in 92." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> That's right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think there's stuff
that unfortunately happens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in every community that we
probably will never find out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> some really fucked up shit
that people have done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah I mean, we've only
recently out about a lot of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's really unfortunate
because we don't like to think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that we know people who are like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but at times proven anything that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've met people who've
been friendly with people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> who have done really
horrible stuff I'm sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I never knew that one of my best friends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> used to punch kids in the face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not bad, those
kids they punched me first. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean once you look up and respect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a fucking serial killer school shooter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then it's all downhill from there, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know hot it feels
to see a police pull me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and being like, oh no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just a mess of emotions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> First it's, surely this is fake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - As you see it you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "I've never seen a police report before." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, could easily be doctored. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then you're seeing all the counts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> being slowly like added and you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh no, oh no, oh no this is bad." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I think that was the first time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I had a conversation
with (indistinct) about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the anime review about how
we should process this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember him saying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah, I think he just
he'll keep the memories </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of Mr.Anime, like the same,
but it's just, he has to view </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Mr. Anime and Trey Sesler
as like different people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think that was the first
time I had just thought about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the entire process of having
to view online personalities </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as different in-person as how they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> portrayed themselves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like whole thing of like separating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the artists from the creation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And yeah, it was more the fact that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this happened in our
small community as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it's like happening
in like the small rural town, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right when nothing happens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I'm sure now in Animetube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure there's some assholes somewhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Someone doing some despicable shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We don't know about but
they weren't a figurehead </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in this very small community. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They weren't the
fucking founding founder. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The literal founding father. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The more you say that out
loud the more I'm like, oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - The founding fathers tend
to normally be sketchy count. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do we sell that the
anime YouTube community </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like this really cool thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, the founding father
is a serial killer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's a conversation starter, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like to think of it of... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's one of those things that
was gonna be started anyway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eventually around that time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah it just so happened
that he was the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or one of the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe that's the reason why nobody used </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> animate in the username until I came up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because I know for a fact
that some of my early videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man those comments were just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "The animate man, I thought
that guy went to jail?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like they legitimately
mistook me for Mr.Anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who would mistake you for that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Rewind that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Flash back to five minutes ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like I obviously
didn't know about that news </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until after I started my YouTube channel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I think what year
was it that he got arrested? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it was eight years ago I think... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The only reason I remember this is 'cause </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the YouTube video that's been recommended </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is eight years ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So that's like 2012, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Something like 2011, 2012. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was probably just a really bad time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because I started 2013 literally
right after it happened, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know about it until I started it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I had like a decent
following and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh fuck I can't go back now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I can't change my name now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "I should have changed it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what was like the early
years of animetube like? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So that was over like what,
well, how long you been here? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 12 years did you say? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Since 2007. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, so how was the animetube
sphere from 2007 to 2012? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like slow, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was very slow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So before 2012, which I kind of like where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I think you came along, it
was the quality was not good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as it is, but it was fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know I kind of in a way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna sound so boomer saying this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I kind of missed old YouTube where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of anything went- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Always look profondly at the time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> when it was smaller, more manageable, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause he was more intimate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah yeah, always look
back at that period, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially on YouTube as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure you all miss the
time when you may like 1000 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you can just talk to random people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember I made a video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when I hit a 1, 000 subscribers
and I thought I'd made it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Mom, I'm dropping out of uni." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I swear, like, I've always
said this to people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the joy of hitting a 1,000 subscribers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is almost comparable to
hitting like a hundred thousand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or a million subscribers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because a 1,000 is just like whoa. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - A 1,000 is like monumental. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is, because it's a
number that is very easily </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like quantifiable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it's also huge because thinking like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Wow there's a 1,000 people who like me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because once it gets to like a million </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it starts to become something that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just can't really
comprehend, like physically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Whereas a 1,000 is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, shit I'm popular. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm fucking popular. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And back then it was
just as I grew into, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it was all about doing anime reviews </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and a lot of people had different styles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you came in with an editing software </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you were just... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember when like
Yazoo, Taku and Tristan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> gloss reflection came along and they used </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sony Vegas to edit their videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it just fucking blew my mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They used the paid pro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Some of the stuff they could get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> away with that I couldn't
do using like putting images </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on windows movie maker. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was amazingly glorified PowerPoint. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think my favorite
animated video from back then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was this guy called Grumpy Jlisan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I fucking love him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do not know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, he's an OG and he
doesn't make videos anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But what he'd do is that
he'd do anime reviews </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but he'd do it in like
the middle of a desert </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in Arizona somewhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You would review an anime while </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like hiking through the desert. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, so it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> he he was basically pre Casey
Neistat because what he'd do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he'd always start off his videos with like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with him walking towards the camera </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like the middle of the desert. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what he would have to do is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> he would have to set up his camera, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hike like a hike away off screen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then hike back into
view of the camera. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He wasn't like he was
hiking a short distance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He wouldn't be literally like hiking over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> hills and mountains sometimes
to get to the camera. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How long was this intro? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like two minutes? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like super sped up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you'd just see him
walking towards the camera. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it'd be like a squirrel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like skirling like
towards the camera. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Today, we're gonna talk about a bizarre." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of his reviews, he
always had like a place to go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So he would start with
at the front of the trail </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like today we're gonna
talk about hunter, hunter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then as he's walking, he
would talk about the show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then usually the one I saw,
I forgot which anime it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but he was hiking up this mountain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he must've like
perfectly timed this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like he must've done the hike beforehand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the moment he got to the top </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was when he finished his
conclusion on the show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I've made it to the top guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "And that's the end of my review." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, that's fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thinking back it was very different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> from what everyone was doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we were just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, old man reviewing anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "That's pretty weird." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But thinking back, he was... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A lot of his ideas were really cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ahead of his time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A little bit ahead of his time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that's why he stands out to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> apart from the guy who
killed himself, I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No not killed himself
but killed someone else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah it was kind of like
the wild West back then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean all of you all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So if that's the first era, we all like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 2007, 2012, what came after that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's like the era? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> What years are we talking between? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I can't trust it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I didn't start until 2015. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So all of it before that is like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd say around about... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember exactly
when it was founded, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but that was kind of like
the wild West of YouTube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where everyone was kind
of doing their own thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was a mess of different things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then 2012 was kind
of what like where the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anime community really started to form </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into this one one conglomerate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think the big event that happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was probably PodTaku. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - PodTaku was huge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was the first time I
recognized anyone outside of you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh there's other people? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I remember because I was already... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we had four original members. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was Holden reviews, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Jean who was originally
called extra disturbed jeans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a Tristan, the Glass Reflection. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember what started
it was Tristan one day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> messaged me out, messaged
me out of the blue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the YouTube DMs being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey do you wanna talk about
this new anime season?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this was before I'd
even started watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seasonal anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This was before the concept of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey you can watch anime weekly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "and be hyped for seasonal anime." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I'm pretty sure
you made a joke in one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of your videos where it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why would I want to come
over the space of 12 weeks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where I could just come and warm? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was a joke you made
and I remember that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought you completely
forgot about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's an amazing joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For some reason that stuck with me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's a great example. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would like to come in one, go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And my thought process
is why would I want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a 12th of an orgasm when I can just have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one orgasm one second. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and so we made this podcast, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which wasn't even a podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was kind of just a recorded Skype call </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we didn't know where to put it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I made the suggestion to put it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on YouTube because this was before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it was an audio podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It wasn't a visual podcast like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So nobody thought that's
putting audio podcasts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on YouTube at work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Well, YouTube is so why not? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Why not put it on YouTube?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't like saying it like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it's kind of sounds like it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sucking my own dick or whatever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like PodTaku was a
big factor in shaping the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime YouTube community of that time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, absolutely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You get left as somebody
who wasn't even interested </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in being anonymous
YouTube definitely shaped. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think how I felt about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because at the time I
was listening to PodTaku </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like every week, like I never
wanted to be crossed my mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but definitely when I got into it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think a lot of the influences
came from listening to that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I think you may not
have shaped the generation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you were in but you definitely helped </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shape the one that came after. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a reason why even to this day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> people who were around in the anime.... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - People back then still are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah remember PodTaku?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Even people who didn't
watch PodTaku, knew PodTaku </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean it's still a
big point in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think back to PodTaku very fondly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> even though it's like ended now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I've moved on in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It had a big part of
shaping me as a person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's especially because PodTaku </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was the first ever friends I made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I could talk to anime with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That goes all the way
back to the conversation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we had at the start about Holden and Jean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were literally the first people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was able to bond over anime with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And PodTaku was kind of
like my weekly, biweekly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of session where I could
just nerd over annually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Just bring it into with your buddies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And apparently a lot of
people looked up to us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back then because a lot
of people apparently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't also have friends
to watch anime with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I listened to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And so that really... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like that cemented the next era </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of anime YouTube before
I think you came along </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think that was kind of the era </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of YouTube where it was, I think it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a lost era where
people could just make content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without a monetary incentive in mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because we did PodTaku not
because we were getting paid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We weren't getting paid for it at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For a lot of it we basically made it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we just wanted to... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was a passion, but it
was kind of like this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but back then this was before we had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any kind of monetization. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We were just four mates who would just go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> go on a Skype call and record the audio </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just splice it together
and upload it on YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I came in when
the fat checks start. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, but like, I don't think
it's too much to say that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this podcast included there's
a lot of anime podcasts now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Big and small. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't think it'd
be too far to say that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> PodTaku probably the one
who probably got the train </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rolling in that side of attitudes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It kind of amazes me 'cause
like before this came along </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before Trash Taste came along, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you look back to some of the
views and popularity of PodTaku </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and it still basically
holds up almost to a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the bigger podcasts that came after it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, there's only a few
podcasts that I can think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of that came after PodTaku- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That anime related. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that we're able
to do better with it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in terms of using user stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And PodTaku is like six years old now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So that kind of blows my mind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you wanna hear with
blast from the past? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Warning, the
following audio may contain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coarse language and other
materials that may not be suitable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for a younger audience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Viewer discretion is advised. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is screaming to do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's like maybe a couple of 100 people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching this right
now who just cream that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that intro is like
ingrained in my mind, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Your accent warning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like it's so 2012. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Also we may spoil
anything and everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you have been warned. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you go to my channel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the very very first
video is like a podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It looks very reminiscent
of the editing style </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of another podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Looks very very similar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the cubes flashing up between. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause yeah did you edit all of them? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, no so originally
it was basically between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me and Tristan and Holden who had to edit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most of the podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And so we basically edited the audio </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they would sync up and we
would remove a lot of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you have calls on Skype. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - People talking over each other? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - People talking over each other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have this really
awkward pause where it's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You've cut it up smoother. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then we were like we wanted to make it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a bit more visual. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> We couldn't just film
ourselves next to each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we kind of just decided
to go with flashing boxes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah it works really well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And that was our way of
just evolving the podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember after
PodTaku we kind of added </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a few more people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanted to ask about
that because I was... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When I as a viewer, I was so confused. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> There were just people
like towards the end </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would you stop joining in? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I was like, J-Taku? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like what is
going on with all of this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was Jimmy on the podcast? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah Jimmy was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was so odd 'cause it just seemed like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people were just recycling
in and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Wait, this is not what
I wanted the boys." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - For the big four. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wanted the big four back then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> As a viewer, I was so confused. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think you guys like
ever explained any of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So, I mean, I'd be interested in that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - For me it was because the
scheduling just got super hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like I said, we weren't
getting paid for anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So this was just us making time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we got to a point
with PodTaku where we were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having a fucking hard time keeping up with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this two week schedule. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I wanted to and it had been
awhile since PodTaku started. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So I wanted to spice things up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I wanted to see if there was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we could get some chemistry
with other people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's when I brought
on the idea of J-Taku </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and adding more people and
making it a distinct brand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of PodTaku is where we
just talk about pure, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever we want to talk about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's kind of like a free flowing podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And J-Taku is we're gonna
pick a specific topic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we're gonna stay on top. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that was the kind of idea of J-Taku. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was kind of hit
everything 'cause it added </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> some new elements to the
podcast and also made it so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> less of a load was on the
original four as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, it's interesting
to hear what you guys thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about it as a view of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I didn't watch every single one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I think I just
saw like three J-Taku </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was so confused and
then I watch it and I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Who are half of these people?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I think it really worked at first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because J-Taku did his job. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And then he got to the
point when J-Taku kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Of even maybe became the flagship series. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause if you look on even
look on the PodTaku channel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of the most viewed videos ended </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up being J-Taku, originally J-Taku videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like our most viewed video was one where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we literally just talk about hental. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But that was back when talking about him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like very harsh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Nobody likes nobody publicly
like 10 times Twitter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Allow me to introduce myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So J-Taku kind of became
one of the flagship series </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause he just got more views. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And the main, the original four people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it would just became harder
and harder us to schedule </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> with the original podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think that's kind of what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> brought like helps bring PodTaku to an end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I feel like that era of anime tube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is defined by the start of
PodTaku and the end of PodTaku </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I think the end of PodTaku really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it coincidentally coincided
with a lot of times when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Joey really rose and people realized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they could do anime
content for money as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which just wasn't an idea before then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember, I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> should I talk about the end of PodTaku? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go ahead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you want man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are we about to do this now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Am I really going to bring this up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's up to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay so I guess I've
never talked about this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but we've obviously
gotten a lot of comments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> about PodTaku on this point on caps. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Comment on this podcast and it was weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think anyone's really
publicly talked about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and to preface this I still
love everyone on the podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not about to talk mad
or anything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't belong in the story
the long and the short </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of it is that we came into
some creative differences </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about which way the podcast could go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because to me PodTaku
was the defining podcast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the anime community as I have just said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I really wanted to push that further. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanted to go talk to like evolve more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I saw the potential in
how big the podcast could be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because the problem was that
we had trouble keeping up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with our schedule and then we
took like a seven month break </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's very long. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was a very long. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, yeah, Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the reason for that was basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the podcast didn't really
have like a designated leader </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> leading it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm thinking like at the
beginning of the podcast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was mainly me and Tristan
who were getting things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like getting things done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean Jean, loved Jean
she was like the mother </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the group, but she
was like she would like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> come in and out because she was very busy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with her real life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Holden fucking times busy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know I've talked just told him before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unless you tell... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you tell Holden to do
something, he'll fucking do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you don't he won't do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you don't, he's not the type of... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He wasn't the type of person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that would like push people to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think he's changed
now for the better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think PodTaku was definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a big learning experience for him as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I think he's definitely
grown as a person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but back then it was mainly me and Tristan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who was pushing stuff to
get done on the podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And Tristan started to
get less and less involved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because he started to
transition doing anime reviews </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as a hobby to actually
finally getting paid for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause he had opened his patreon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> He was the only one that
was actively doing videos- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was time when Tristan was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really at his peak, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he was not really growing up at that time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember his patron was a big deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because he was the only one
who had other commitments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for his own YouTube channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So he just had less time than all of us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then for me, that was also the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I got my job at BBC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you see all these
factors coming into play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where the driving force of the podcasts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just had less time to really make episodes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and people in J-Taku we
were all good friends, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they weren't the original four. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They didn't really have the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd say authority to really takeover. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't really step in and be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "This is mine." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we basically took a seven month hiatus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or it's a hiatus but it
was more of not nothing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was getting done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I won't send
anything in the group chat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nothing was really happening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They left you on read. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it was basically because
we just didn't have the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And what was the driving force
for it to be revamped was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was the point when I
wanted to return to YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was getting bored with
my job and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, first step I wanna
put all my hard work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into PodTaku." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And really revamping this because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Tristan's doing really well
with whatever he's doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with his patron. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I saw potential for
not only me coming back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but also pushing PodTaku
into something even bigger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and better than what it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with help formally and
trying to monetize it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And they just basically making it- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have an incentive ever
to turn up every week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so it ended up being... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was the big driving
force to getting PodTaku </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> back on its feet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's why I got
super, super invested in it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I was the one who was getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to get episodes done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was editing a lot of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> not because I wanted
to be paid or anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I just wanted this- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was your passion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanted my passion to
be back on the ground. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And as soon as I felt it
was kind of getting back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off the ground, I remember
Trisan coming to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "I want it to end." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I looking back now
I totally understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why he did, right because this is where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is where I put it back to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> creative differences because
he saw that we weren't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting as many views as we
used to before the hiatus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And also the dynamic of the
group was very different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than when then when we started some people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weren't getting along as well
as they were at the beginning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So he wanted PodTaku to just end there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> He wanted to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, instead of just
fizzling, fizzling out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanted to end here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I really really tried
to convince him to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Look I know we're going
through some very big issues now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "but I see potential in this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was a lot of factors that I saw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that could potentially have
driven a lot of hype back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in PodTaku before we ended there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> We had Jean had just left. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But she was gonna come
back we had scheduled that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we had also scheduled PodTaku two episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which was like our most popular one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Look, we can do the come." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I really, really tried to convince him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that it was too early </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I totally agree
with all the problems </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that the podcast had in order to survive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and to go further we
would have had to make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of big changes and
they could have very easily </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> blown up in our face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess it's one of those
things where it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you could try, but you
could very easily fail. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's one of those things
where you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Do I wanna put in this work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "and I can get the guaranteed paycheck?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I kind of get it but at
the same time, I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "As a viewer I knew how big
it could have been as well." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Looking at my position now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I understand how it all works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, yeah, it could have been an option. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It could have been severed, definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It would have needed a lot of work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it would have taken a big risk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we could have failed massively. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But for me as a person, I
would rather give that a go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then the wonder. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And it got to the point
when it was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just this one clash, right of just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought he was too early to end it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Tristan wanted to want it to end it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was unfortunate
that I signed, fortunately </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't get my way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> They didn't listen to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I tried so hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a video that you
guys all made when it ended. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember watching this and that one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of those moments, you're
like, please say science </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> please say science. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But I remember watching
that video and it like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I remember the order,
it was like you first. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was like, Tristan was last. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I love trust and by
the way, just say it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But I remember watching him, I seem like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> man it kind of seems like
everyone was like really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wanting to keep doing this,
but then Tristan didn't, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> almost as a viewer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It wasn't like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was at the end- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - As a viewer I think that's an impression </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could be totally wrong just compression. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that was definitely a fraction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that supported my stance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There was the faction that
support a Tristan stance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - As someone who creates
now I can understand both. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't care about either. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean it's definitely
a tough decision right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Anybody in that position
would have been like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fuck do I take the risk or not?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - If his heart's not in
it, his heart's not in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> If you're gonna like drag someone along </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> who doesn't wanna do it, you can't like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So was there no option to
just do it without Tristan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, we wanted to
respect Tristan's wishes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> There was the conversation of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should we do this without Tristan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But it just felt wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah understandable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I wanted to leave the option. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I asked Tristan, would it
be okay if we continued </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then at any point,
if for whatever reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you want to return the
doors they were always open. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And Tristan was like adamant, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "No, I don't." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I understand because
this was his baby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, I don't feel
comfortable letting my baby go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just seeing what happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So that's was kind of like the last straw, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was no going back from that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And yeah, that's basically how it ended. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was after that I kind
of lost a lot of motivation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'd put so much of
myself into getting this revamped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it just felt like it
was just all taken away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was out of my control
and I learned a lot from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> PodTaku with like learning
working on group projects </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I wanna say I'm not throwing
shade at Tristan at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We still get along great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love Tristan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just a point where we just had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> creative differences- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it happens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel that's a very normal thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> What I'm trying to say is I've really- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Demonized and like don't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I'm not demonizing Tristan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> We just had a different
way of approaching things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I still think back to
PodTaku and I still think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, I think it ended too early." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he obviously thinks the other way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he thought the other way back then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's basically what it ended to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How it is, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's how it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah obviously we
don't want anyone going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Who the fuck man? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Why don't you not believe in it, man?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, like I said earlier, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like if your heart's on it
and your heart's not in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's not gonna happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, can anyone
like really blame Tristan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> again, it's a fucking... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would've really vibrating as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I didn't believe in it
I'm normally someone who's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> adamant about shit, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I would be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "No, no, I don't believe in this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I would do like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's just how it is, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah I always look back
to think what could it be? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But that was just the end of an era. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now we're in a new era </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everyone's gone down
the different paths. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm really amazed to see
what people are getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> onto nowadays. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's fucking great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I still speak to all the cast members </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> every now and again especially
when we would get to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meet in a convention. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hey, bottom line is
that at least there isn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a single member of PodTaku </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that went and killed their family. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> They didn't go down to Mr.Anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the silver lining. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the silver lining. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 80s outro where it tells
you what we've opened up to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The fucking snapshot is like yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey, didn't his family. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Before we end it, right
I guess the way I see it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Is if you were still doing
PodTaku your Trash Taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably wouldn't exist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes that's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not trying to say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm glad that you'll pass your project, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm glad that we have this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I'm very glad as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Please don't kill your families. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Just going to throw that out there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're not British, how do I get a gun? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even know how do you do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't wanna have
to make a twit longer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like, so about Connor- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My thoughts on Seadog V God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - This has gotta be real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna kill your family, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just stop talking about killing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm so sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Until you choose with
anime, let's fucking do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I miss her anime I mean the army man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean both. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah we should've seen
the signs all along. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was in the name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - My God it kind of felt
that when PodTaku ended </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it kind of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like tearing down
the Berlin wall, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just letting everyone fucking loose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I feel like when a
big pillar in a community </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of falls right it's
just like a ton of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> covering for all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Basically like it's kind of
like everyone's looking for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the new, like, all right who's the person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna listen to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We don't really have that at the moment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think we do, we
have a few big people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I feel that that's when definitely, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you said the new era
just was like all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because back then it was
all about doing anime reviews. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I would say the
content started to really like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it kind of like opened the doors </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to all different kinds of content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you were doing more blogging videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and analytical channels
start to come along. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I feel, it was a
coincidence that it happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> during the end of PodTaku </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I feel like for our community, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was a big turning point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I remember that was when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> demo came along as well,
near enough back then when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he was starting he
changed the game as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, definitely like there is... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think there's a single attitude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's on the platform right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and no longer on the platform </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who didn't look up the
demo in any accident. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - He did anime stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah anime stuff like demo
was just a name that came back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like the dad that
went to go buy cigarettes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and just never came back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm glad I came into it when I did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like I came into
it at the time where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's perfect because it was where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanted to make the
content I wanted to make. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think you came at a perfect time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it was around the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when the whole anime
YouTubing thing really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> diversified itself in
terms of its content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So people like you who did very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unconventional anime content, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it was very to just slip in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's great I'm glad that
it's gone to the point where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> we can make a set like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause in my mind, I
didn't wanna do a podcast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> unless it was this good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I have no interest in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I don't wanna do
audio, an audio podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is what I kind of
wanted to push PodTaku </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to the direction of going like me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like we obviously didn't
live in the same place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but my idea was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey, what if we all flew to a place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "record tons of episodes and
released it on a schedule?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And we could do that on
a periodic basis based </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on like, whatever funding
we could've gotten. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But I'm glad that I
have you guys now who... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's taken me how long? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not the one saying that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> People in that first episode were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "This is just PodTaku 2.0?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, I'm hosting next. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just gonna do that intro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You have to do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You have to do it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it's, it's great, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I like you said earlier
about the ambition of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think us three really
have like really great ideas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of ways that we want to
make this not just a podcast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but something really crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like they like the Akihabara video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was just like just a
step in the Stephanopoulos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like to say, I thought
of the Akihabara video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in the shower. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck tier list, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Wow, it's poking for the hip." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And he was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't know who did it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - In my head I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Who the fuck is this?' </SPEAKER_04>
