<SPEAKER_01> (Joey slurping) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mm, very good stuff.
- Clearly didn't put any. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey clicking teeth) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't expect how
bitter that was gonna be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just black coffee.
- Beans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The beans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (relaxing music) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, I didn't
know what an Americano is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> until I moved to Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You thought it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watered down coffee?
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> watered down coffee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah because, do you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I only started caring about
coffee after I moved to Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because before I moved to Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was so easy to get
reasonable coffee, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Why is the Japan coffee
like, so watered down?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it's 'cause everything here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> is like Americano, it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> watered down espressos.
- Yeah, it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Americano standard of coffee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Is this the cold open? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I guess so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Welcome to this
episode of "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hey, you're not the host. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Happy New Year, boys and girls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Welcome back to another episode of- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well hopefully it's happy New Years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Happy New Year for us, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but maybe for you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is New Years Eve.
- Happy New Years Eve, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're in America. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you're in Japan or around that area, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then happy New Year, welcome to 2022. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm Joey, and I'm with
Garnt and Connor as always. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's the new year, new me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You look like you were just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> serving tables, I just realized. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm here to serve you some
content ladies and gentlemen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Joey just
finished his part-time job </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> serving some tables. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just quickly ran down, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> YouTube's been tough in 2021, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> almost got my channel canceled, sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I got to ask, did you cut your hair </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because you were just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, it's a new year in the podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> New year, new me?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, that's totally
coincidental actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Oh yeah, this
episode is gonna be New Years, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'll look completely different." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, I was just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanted to get a haircut anyway, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I was, oh, I
am still at the point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if I actually
went back to Australia, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I figured if I'm gonna see my parents </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the first time in two years, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe get rid of the Jesus hair, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Get a fresh cut. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, last week I believe
we commented on the country, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thankfully, opening back up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's going to be very dated now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because as we're filming this episode, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the country's closed back down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So by the time this episode comes out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we don't know where
the country's gonna be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, maybe it's gonna be open, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe it's gonna be closed, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ladies and gentlemen, the Omicron. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's just stoop
commenting on current events. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's probably good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's just stop doing that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Then Mr. B screwed, I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah so, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, like literally as of
yesterday of us recording, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japan announced that they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna shut down the country again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is honestly like, I give them props </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that they acted so goddamn quickly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, this new prime minister </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is not fucking around.
- Hold up, hold up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> let's pretend, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if this was something else, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, this was something that
Japan wasn't eager to do, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this would have taken months. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They were like, "Oh we can, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we have an excuse to close borders? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh shit, yeah, well close them." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, they didn't do that
with the Olympics, did they? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, well, I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it depends.
- I think that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I saw online that the
prime minister was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it was like two days prior </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that the new strain had
been announced, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then everyone on
Twitter was like, oh shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it only took the government
two days to act upon this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh no, they decided-
- Why is this like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a rare event? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Shouldn't that be normal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - They decided the moment on, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they just took them
two days to approve it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and then some. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They knew what they were doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But anyway, current events, bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Current event's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> bad.
- Sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> New year, it's over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> New year, new me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> New year.
- It's 2022 guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh wait, did we, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, actually did we say our
like, new year's resolution? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I think we did, 'cause
Chris was on, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We said what we wanted to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you remember what you said? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I mean I- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember what I said. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What, last year? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what I said last year.
- Our first episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> of last year?
- Oh, last year? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It goes to show, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> We're all fucking good with
our new year's resolution, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I remember what I said. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What did you say?
- I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sarcastically saying to Chris, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna be on the Abroad in Japan Channel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Unfortunately.
- And now you are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Unfortunately it's happened many times, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah, and it did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, you actually got through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> with your new year's resolution? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You should be proud.
- You're the first person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know who actually did their </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> new year's resolution.
- Cheers to me, boys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Cheers to me, cheers, cheers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Celebrate my success, gentlemen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Very good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I appreciate that.
- Wait, that was a... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think I brought a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> New Year's-
- Was this the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Rubik's cube thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was yours the Rubik's cube? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Was that 2019? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that was 2019, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I've been able to do a Rubik's cube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the past two years now, at least. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, every time we have a
Rubik's cube in the office now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey just goes ahead and solves it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so he's been able to do it for a while. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do not remember you saying that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as a new year's resolution, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> though.
- I don't think I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> gave in years resolution, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I haven't really been a guy to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like, choose new year's resolutions, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because for the most
like three or four years, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I just haven't been able to do them, so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it must be like, I
feel bad for the viewers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> who probably think that we have
like dementia or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we can't remember
anything what we've said. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then we're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we probably had this
conversation last year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where we're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh yeah, so we just don't like them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so we just decided," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember I must've said
something along the lines of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> "I just prefer small goals that I just." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but I can't, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even remember what
I say like a week ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like sometimes I have a
conversation with my mom, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and she was just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh yeah, when you were
talking about this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't believe you said that." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Mom, I do not remember
saying those words at all." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't even remember
what I had for like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> dinner like three days ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So it was like, you can't expect
me to remember after like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what was like a hundred plus hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of us talking on this show, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you just like, remember
this one little detail? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not gonna happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, 'cause like, I remember
talking about current events, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey's channel right now with the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is in the dire straits. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is in the dire straits, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and of course he uploads
to his second channel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I see it's blown up, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause even my mum, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> my mum sends me a message and she's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I just saw that Joey's
channels in trouble. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have you given him a phone
call to make sure he's okay?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm just like, just
breaking down, crying, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like in my bed, just
weeping into my pillow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean like, as of right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it still hasn't been resolved, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but luckily I have contacted YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm pretty confident
it's gonna get resolved, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so that's why I'm not like,
too stressed about it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was very humbling
when I made that video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like, so many people
came to me and was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, yeah, I'll subscribe and all that." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So thanks if you did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I really like, you know... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like a situation that I
know is gonna be resolved, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but I can still make a
video complaining about it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You get monetized. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, you get monetized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But also it's pushed
like a week off work, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you don't have to upload that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, fantastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I can't upload for
two weeks, all right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause of all the- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Guys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I just wanna bring you this content. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I really do, I just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, I just can't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, you know, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is bittersweet, to be fair, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's cool that this has
been like this explosion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and stuff on the second
channel, but it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wish I didn't have to resort to this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wish it like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my main channel,
literally on life support, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't the reason why I
was getting all these subs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, I mean your second channel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> has basically been becoming your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anime channel for the long
time, for the longest time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So what if you just like
migrating the anime man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to just now it's just Joey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I could.
- It's exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what you wanted all your career, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right?
- It could, it could happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But at the same time, it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna lose nine years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] What if you
pulled an epic prank, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You just change the names and
pictures of both the channels. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What like, so Joey has his own? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you thought about it, really, like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it could work. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe for like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> an hour.
- The old switch-a-roo? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- A good day to switch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah guys, sub to my second channel." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Wink, wink.
- JK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this was the anime man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This was the same channel all along. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then you like, tell everyone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, there's a good group. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You tell everyone, like on Joey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if you go and comment
on the new Joey channel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tell them, "Man, I really
love this Joey content." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just spam all the comments, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so now nobody can see the old comments. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well we can all (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now this can be the side. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So if I actually did do it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Here you go, guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was a prank, you just got pranked." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] I really love
the new Joey channel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Nah, but I'm hoping like
next couple of days, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it will get resolved. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't upload for two weeks? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't upload for two weeks, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which sucks because I have to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause especially when
you're dealing with sponsors, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to tell them like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh sorry, YouTube did a big fucky-wucky, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and now I can't upload." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's very annoying
having to explain that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to companies who clearly
don't understand, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Just upload." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Your channel's still
there, just upload." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, "No, no, no,
that's not how it works." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just the life of a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where you just wake up one day maybe, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you just find out that
maybe your career is in danger, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like, "Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess all of this is
like, now out of my hands." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was so shit as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I got the strike
literally the day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the night I came back
from Hokkaido, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Also it was after a five
day trip with Chris, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, all right,
I gotta just relax now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just get on my computer, maybe watch some, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and my channel's about to die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Amazing, thanks YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember I was extremely drunk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> when all of my channel
got copyright claimed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey snickering) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay.
- I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know how to process it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I was drunk, obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I was like, 'cause
I just had a night out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I was with Garnt, we
must have had a night out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I think I was like, just very like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was that the night that you accidentally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> deleted one of your videos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, that was another night. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] That was a different night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To be fair, I'm sure we
would have done that as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I would have made that mistake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I do remember, God, I must sound terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have we told that story yet? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - We have told that story, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got really drunk, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was like 4:00 AM, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we were at your friend's house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But no, I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was on a trip with Garnt, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we just had like the one night out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, yeah, it
was a really good night. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it was like 4:00 AM,
and I was about to go to bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then my email was
like, could hear like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh poor tuna just playing in my head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like YouTube, YouTube, YouTube, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> copyright claim has been filed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor sighing heavily) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, what do you even do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, do you sober up mentally? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But you're not sober up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, oh, I'm gonna sleep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, your brain's on a
hundred percent overdrive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just, you can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do anything about it.
- 'Cause the problem is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you wanna sort it out
there and then, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just wanna like get
in contact with someone, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just know that you're in the
process of it being sorted out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but a lot of the times,
you just gotta wait, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you just gotta make noise, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just gotta like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hope that someone can
sort this out for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, have I ever told this story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about what happened to all that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> The one that got caught
with the (indistinct)? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think-
- Not on "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, not on "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So yeah, like twice now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all of my channels has been claimed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for the same reason, twice, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was using this outro
song that I think I heard, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where did I get it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I heard it on
Sky William's channel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like, that's a fuckin'... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a throwback. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's a throwback. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He used it as his outro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought, "I like that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And also I was like, I
had like a hundred subs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so I thought, "It's okay if I just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> take the same outro, right?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "No one's gonna see it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then obviously like, people saw it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> got some Sky Williams fans.
- 'Cause people loved it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause he was a banger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Such a banger in fact,
that I had to buy license. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I didn't know there was
an original, original song, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just thought it was just this one song. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, so you had the remix version? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I had the remix version. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't know that it was a remix, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I went to the artist who made it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and the song had a lot of views. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was called like, "Do
it for Love" or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I had this, and I used
this on every single video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Well yeah, it was your outro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, then of course, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this come to bite me in the ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't just play it
when the video ended, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it would like fade into the video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So this will come back to bite me later. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I got, in like 2000, maybe '17 or '16, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I got, I wanna say 80% of my
channel copyright claimed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And this is on the old system as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it wouldn't tell you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I think it didn't tell you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which time it was copyright claimed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It would just say you've
been copyright claimed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the thing.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it was by a company that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on behalf of the artist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> who I purchased the license from for $50. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I bought this license. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Back then I thought, "Holy
shit, it's so much money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God, this is how
much the licenses cost?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a whole month on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I'm like, well basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - At that time.
- At that time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like a lot of money, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And this is back when I was
terrified of everything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and I remember I bought
licenses to fonts and shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm pretty sure I'm the only
person on earth who paid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for license for a font. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you paid for WinRAR? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want to though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just to tell the guy I appreciate it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you have to be above
the age of 70 to do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna meet a single
person who has paid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for WinRAR.
- I'm gonna do it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on live stream, I'm gonna do it live. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Just to see what happens? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just wanna see what happens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What happens?
- Do you just explode? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey groans) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> We weren't designed for this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The stream just ends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I buy WinRAR. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a test. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You win life at that point, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, congratulations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The simulation shuts down, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you just see like the congrat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like the entire world just
disintegrates around you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just wake up like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey gasping) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know the Bible story from like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> a hundred episodes ago? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, there are
people who pay for WinRAR, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and there are people who don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] God comes down and says stop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know the flying society thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, society, everyone paid for WinRAR. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I paid for this license
and whatnot, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I angrily emailed the guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Bear in mind, I was like 19, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so I was like trying to conduct
myself as a businessman, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I didn't know what
the fuck I was doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I angrily emailed him
from my Hotmail account, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I instructed him that
I'd purchased this license, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> please tell this person to stop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so this whole thing where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the guy wrote me an email being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, you have my word that
you bought the license." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I had like, PayPal receipts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So then I had to email this company </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was claiming on behalf,
which I think was Distrokid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So he had put this song in
a copyright claiming thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it went around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I had a bit of
difficulty, it took a while, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I eventually got Distrokid to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stop claiming my stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they stopped claiming
it all, and it was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember how I did it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like this long,
whole process, it was awful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then all good, all good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I kept using the outro after that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is where I should
have learned my lesson, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and changed the outro, but I'd thought, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'd won the battle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd won it, I'd done it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also, the song is a banger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The song kind of slaps, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd thought, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd proven to some entity
that this is legit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I have the artist who
says that it's all good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I thought, okay, this is it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm good to use this now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I paid for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got proof and we're all Gucci. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so I carry on using it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then, maybe a year later, I wanna say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how long
exactly, there was a timeline, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get claimed again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> This time, like two-thirds
of my channel, I want to say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this is right before they
added the option to mute. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like, now if you
get copyright claimed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause sometimes there's
still bullshit claims. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They'll find like one second, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they'll say "We
own the entire video." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So just mute it for one second. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck off, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you can have it.
- You can mute it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or delete the segments, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> which is one of the more positive changes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> YouTube has made.
- A Godsend. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know?
- Definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And unfortunately
this situation happened, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna say like, one before
they introduced that tool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I got all of my thing claimed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was kind of like,
what the fuck do I do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because two thirds of
my revenue just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got Thanos'd away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And this happened to my channel for about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna say two months straight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So for two months straight,
my earnings are like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I lost so much money
that I never got back, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's very, very, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm still to this day
quite annoyed about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I went on this whole thing of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right, what the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So, it was like Warner Brothers
or something had claimed it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on behalf of some artists
that I'd never heard of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I go, and I find out
that this was a remix, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, oh shit, I didn't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And apparently this was like a big artist, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm an idiot, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I didn't know who this person was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's probably why it was a banger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why it was a banger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And so, I was like,
okay, so this is weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I thought that he sold me this license, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So I very confidently counter
every single claim thinking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "I've got the license, it's all good," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I get denied. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I appeal them
as well, which is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you lose all these appeals,
your channel gets deleted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I appealed a bunch of them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and for some reason I just
got denied the appeal, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but nothing happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I just couldn't
appeal again, it was weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so now, now I was starting
to be like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, what's going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I counted all these claims and
stuff and nothing happened, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't really know what to do now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I remember I got in touch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the guy who I
bought the license from, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who was the artist who made the song. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Hey, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's going on, man? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You sold me a license. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is it good, or is it not?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, "Well, I have
the license to make the remix, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I don't think," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then he was like, "I'm not
sure what I can and can't," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I asked a YouTube
man who is a lawyer man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He gave me advice that
was not legal advice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Every single sentence ended with, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "This is not legal advice," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He basically informed me that yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this license was no good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bogus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whether the artist knew
that or not, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> He might genuinely not have known. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So he basically- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well if he's like an
Indie artist as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> he's probably- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I assumed that he didn't fully know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you stroke it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think he knew.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was a weird thing, and I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and so I asked the guy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I went had like really angry DMs with him </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> back and forth where I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "So can I use this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Did you fuck me over?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, "Do you know how
much this fucks me?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, "What am I supposed to do?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And so in the end it turned out, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was in the wrong, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I had been sold this bogus license </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was like, not real. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so then I was like,
well fuck, what do I do now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've just lost like three or four, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it was three years of YouTube work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is just gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just can't use any of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So scary, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so I made this video ranting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, "Fuck." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, "What do I do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's just so fucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been wronged," et cetera, et cetera. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know, and I YouTube
for help at the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they just didn't help me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, well,
what the fuck am I doing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then funny enough, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had a YouTube partner manager
before all of this went down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who was really good, surprisingly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because normally they don't talk to you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then that person left the company, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I got someone new, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they introduced
themselves through an email, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then never heard from them again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey snorting) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's how it always is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's how it is, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so I went on like
a mini-rant in this video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like, Yeah, YouTube is useless. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They don't do anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I have the shoe-shoe person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They never talked to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They don't help me at all." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> After that video goes live, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got an email from a YouTube person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like, "Hey."
- Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Hey, I'm that person
that you were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was saying that was useless.
- Shit-talking? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, I'd actually like to
help your situation out." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "Oh, okay, that's great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Awesome." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So they basically said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey, so what we can do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is we can go through every single video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and if you send me the file again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without the music in it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we can replace the video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and take off the thing."
- Like on the back? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, I had to go through 200
videos, and re-render them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or just cut out the music, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause some of the files, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't have the original files anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, the Adobe file or
whatever, like it was tough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Luckily, a lot of the more recent ones, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the ones I liked and was more proud of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like at that time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You had the original files. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had the original files. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, we had like 200 videos on Google Drive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> linked in an Excel spreadsheet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we had to one by one swap them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But this process wasn't perfect either, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because videos got uploaded
to the wrong video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you'd click on a
certain thumbnail and title, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and it took you to a
different video, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was like, that
was the original video, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and then they replaced
it with another video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that got put there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I did like, there was like a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember it was an "Attack
on Titan" impressions, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and "Yuri on Ice" impressions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They both got swapped, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so when people went to
"Yuri on Ice" impressions, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just me doing
"Attack on Titan" things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then when it was the other one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was the other video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I sat there with
YouTube for like an hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to explain to
them what was happening, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the subtitles also got swapped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So they were looking at the
video only in the subtitles, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the raw subtitle data, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they were like, "No,
no, it's the right one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're talking about 'Yuri on Ice' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the subtitles or something," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, "No,
no, no, no, the video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the video is wrong." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like panicking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was getting tons
of comments being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, fix this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you not just like,
swap the titles around? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was just weird, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because all the entire video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is swapped.
- Did you see what Joey is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna do with this channel? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do a whole switch-a-roo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wonder what the side
effects are of this is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> so eventually we got it all sorted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just go on the channel when like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> why has this "Attack on Titan"
video got "Yuri on Ice?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, what's going on there? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly, so all the
comments were like that too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't remember Yuri </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in "Attack on Titans."
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it was all weird, and then like, again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like two months later, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it finally all got done, and we did it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Some of the videos, like I
said, they couldn't be salvaged. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And the reason why it
came to bite me back later </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was because some outros in
my videos now, I just mute. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you can't hear anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also 'cause like, I
had the exact same thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but after YouTube introduced
the whole muting thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I had my old, old intro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So my current intro now is
made by my friend from uni </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who used to be like a music
producer and it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not even out on like
any website or anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So I know it's like, good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's all copyright free, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because I had the exact
same thing where I saw, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I went on to like SoundCloud, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I found like this
really like banger song. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, cool, I'll use it as an outro," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's like kind of wacky, goofy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you know, all the gaming YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was using it at the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And then of course, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that artist got really
popular on SoundCloud. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Because every
YouTuber was using. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Got a major record label because of it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then the record label
copywrite claimed all of my shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I had, same thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I DM'd the artist, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, so what's happening now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You said I could use it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she's like, "Yeah, but
I'm like a big shot now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got a major record
label, and unfortunately, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't do anything for you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But luckily this was
during the time where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again, YouTube introduced
the muting thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Still kind of shitty of them to not, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you asked, did you ask
them permission initially? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So I asked, so I DM'd the artist initially </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when she was just on SoundCloud, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and she was like, "Yeah,
please, go for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I'd love that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like just, you know, obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's kind of fucked up, what the heck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Just link it in the
description, you'll be all good." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, oh sweet,
that's very nice of her. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then yeah, she was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Well, sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's not my decision,
that's my label's decision. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, sorry." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] So shitty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like, if you go back
to videos from like 2017, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where I use that outro,
they're all mute at the end. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I've got a lot of videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's just me talking at the end, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I still get comments
just saying, being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Why does it just go silent?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Yeah, man." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, I've
had to use that feature </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for some of my videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like I don't mute it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just cut out like the- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, now you can replace the music. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you can replace the music, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I believe I had to
do that for "Trash Taste" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> or something, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because that got copyright
claimed or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the specials, or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, and "After Dark" as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For some reason I'll
intro for "Trash Taste" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> got copyright claims, and after that- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] On Twitch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - On Twitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A royalty-free song. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a royalty-free
song, but Twitch was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "No, no, no, no." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well the copywrite
system's unfortunately </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> really easy to abuse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you can stick any
old fuckin' piece of music, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and start claiming shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's only until
somebody like, stops you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- So, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like the weirdest
copyright claimed I've gotten </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like for anime music that
I've put into my videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like before, like anime
oversees were just free game, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because Japan, the anime industry
didn't really give a shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And now they're slowly coming
to realize, wait a minute, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> YouTubers use our music. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How can this be? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like now anime OSTs are
starting to be claimed as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I didn't get claimed by
one of the anime companies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I, in one of my videos,
I had "You Say Run" on it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I got claimed, and
"You Say Run" got claimed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it didn't get claimed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it got claimed by our cover of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You Say Run."
- What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So a YouTuber who I believe
is signed with a record label </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also made a video where they
made a cover of "You Say Run," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's got like, the
original "You Say Run" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I used in my video
got claimed by a cover </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of "You Say Run".
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And yeah, that's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where do I even begin with that, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like that's a. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, yeah, like super
early in my YouTube channel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I used to do like covers of anime songs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like on guitar and piano
and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Reason of why I don't do that anymore, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's because the few times I
ever got a copyright strike, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not a claim, a strike
was from a cover I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I did a cover of fuckin'
"Paranoid Android" by Radiohead, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because it was the ending to "Ergo Proxy," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and at the time it was
like, I really liked it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And yeah, I got a fucking strike on it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not sure if that can
also be a humblebrag, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because that's like saying
like, you were so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I covered it.
- YouTube literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thought it was the real thing.
- YouTube thought it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the original song. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Thanks YouTube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but also, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've had my voice claimed
a few times actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, my own videos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> People trying to claim my like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> say like, where I'm just
talking, there's nothing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's obviously not VA. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I've seen a TikTok of that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's weird, it's weird,
it's pretty bizarre. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I don't know.
- I've never heard of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I heard like, an original
as one dude on YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> one time he uploaded his original song, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then got claimed by someone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> someone claimed his original song </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that he uploaded to his own channel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] How? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, 'cause anyone
can put anything content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh, that's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, these companies
are given free reign. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, remember there was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I forgot when it was,
it was like maybe 2018, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> there was like that copyright
Armageddon that was happening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where like all these
like fake companies were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> going around, and just like striking? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it's still
happening, because like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not as bad as
it used to be, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not, it definitely isn't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm glad, like one
of the positive things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> YouTube has done has given
creators tools to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for example, cut or mute the segment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that has been copyright claimed it out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which we just didn't have before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So if we've got a copyright claim before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like a second of music, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then there was just like,
nothing we could do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just like a dead video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Man, you know what companies suck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, there's fuckin' like,
Viral Hog and all those dudes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the ones that buy viral videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And just go around claiming
them, and like Armageddon, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, fuckin' awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like Nine Gag and stuff like that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So they're like these,
you know when you see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> those watermarks on Facebook? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, do you remember that video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of that dude punching the kangaroo? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- LADBible? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Kinda like that, but a bit different, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because LADBible, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't normally go
around copyright claim, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but that video, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> The person who had that video
sold it to this company, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then what they do
is everyone who's then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> talking about it was showing it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll just go around and
copyright claiming everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and any of these news networks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] That's scummy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well that's the business model, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like they buy these videos
for like very cheap, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even like, have you ever had offers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from people who wanna buy your videos? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- It's really weird, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah.
- I've had that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They'll go around buying them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then just claim everything,
and it's just, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's really shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause people react to
stuff on stream as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And also the worst thing is about that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> luckily I'm 99% of you will
never have to experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that these copyright claims, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes they're like
really fucking generous </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the timing on the video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, so they have to say
what time in the video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they copyright claimed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and sometimes they'll add on like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 5 or 10 seconds to the end, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, "You piece of shit." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Now I've got to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like a clear edit and everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've got to edit out or mute shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you don't get to contest the time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so whatever the time is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like, if you wanna
mute the corporate content, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't get to say where it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's whatever they submitted is it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So one time, on one video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember I reacted to
like a clip or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on a live stream or something or Connadog. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they claimed it and I
was like, that's fair enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then they claimed
like 40 seconds extra, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing to do with said clip. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I was like, "Wow dude, like really?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like a four second clip.
- They own your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> reaction as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nah, nah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The videos like that,
where I react to shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't give a fuck, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's like, bro, what are you doing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't claim shit that isn't
the video, like, come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You're just lazy, you don't want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to put in the time.
- But that's the problem, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right, it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like YouTube has done
a really good job of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to make the playing field
as fair as possible, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like only recently they added
that whole thing of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how during an appealing process, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the money that the video accumulates </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> goes into what's called
escrow, which is like kind of- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] What you should've done anyway. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's kind of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it doesn't go to the person who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is the supposed copyright
holder, or the video owner, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it kind of like, it's
floating in the cloud </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> until it's resolved. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah, it's like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which is great, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's fantastic.
- It's like if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put in a pool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> No one can get that until
the copyright situation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is resolved. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is fantastic, but
like at the same time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> even today I feel the advantage
is still in the claimant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Clearly YouTube is like, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously if you're
gonna go out of your way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to claim something copyright-wise, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you must have a good reason for it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but a lot of companies don't. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> to get your own Ayylien products today. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you Ayylien clothing
for sponsoring this episode, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back to the video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But speaking of like other
changes that YouTube has made. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now the dust has settled
on the first like thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so like, has
dislikes been removed? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm very confused, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> because I can still
see them on my channel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a slow process.
- On your channel, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Not on anyone else's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, on anyone else's channel though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it should be completely gone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I can see, I can still
see it on videos, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Let me check, let me check. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] I know that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh no, it's gone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, literally, I was literally- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's been like that for days. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, I literally looked
at fuckin' videos yesterday </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was just like, what
is the dislike channel? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then where is the dislikes going? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's getting like
slowly implemented, I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so not all channel owners can see, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like at least with your own content, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can still see your dislikes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which goes completely against
the argument that YouTube made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as to why they wanted to
get rid of the dislikes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I remember I made a
video on a second channel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and one of the YouTube reasonings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for getting rid of the
dislike button was that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh if you see dislikes on your videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it discourages smaller creators, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Perhaps they're getting disliked bombed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> perhaps they're getting bullied, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and no one likes to see
a bunch of dislikes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yet, you can still see
dislikes on your own videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, I'm just
glad they're standing up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the small creators, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all two of them or something that exists </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> on the entire platform of YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that have ever complained about this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I was talking to this about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with a bunch of other YouTubers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I asked them, do you
know a single creator </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in your field that has ever
complained about dislike bombs? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like whatever size, and
not a single person I know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> has ever been like a
target of dislike bombs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the point where it actually
actively ruins their channel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you ever received
a lot of dislikes? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, 'cause I feel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> me and Garnt make more opinionated videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than you do, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So obviously there are some opinions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've said in the past
that people aren't very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happy with.
- I've never really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had a lot of dislikes on one video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've had some videos
that didn't do as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, what do you classify
as a lot of dislikes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - More than... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like 10%? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 10% is quite a lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I've had a few
videos, but not that much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't have that much, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> most of it is like the more
controversial opinion videos, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but in general-
- All people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who didn't like, watch the video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up to the end.
- I think I've had 10%. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think the only one was the... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The Christian one.
- The Christian one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- Understandable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not everyone's cup of tea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but, no, I've had
a few where it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I look back on those videos, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> or like how I presented them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can see why they got dislike bombed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't really blame them for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess I remember like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think one that really blew up recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that got quite a few
dislikes, I think it is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a nine to one is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's an old "Let's Fight" episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> where the title of it is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Beserk is Not a Masterpiece," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Dislike. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's like, right now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it's at 10 or 15% dislike, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it only blow up after
Mira-sensei's par scene, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Because obviously people were searching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of "Beserk" and all that, and obviously, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if you watch the video,
I argue against that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You'd know that Joey is like
the biggest "Beserk" simp. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Like, ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was the title. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I used that because that was
one of the opinions I got, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I fought against it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but clearly people don't
watch it all the way through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or up to that point, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> so they just see the title and they think, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, this guy hates Beserk, dislike." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - In some ways I, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I personally liked the dislike button, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but in other ways I think it
doesn't really do anything, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it doesn't serve. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The only place-
- Have you ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> actively disliked a video? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yes.
- Yes, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, but here's the problem, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - For what reason? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah but, this is the problem, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no agreed upon
consensus on when you dislike. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You could dislike because
you disagree with the opinion, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could dislike because
you didn't enjoy the video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as much as another one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you could dislike because you
just don't like the person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like the dislike, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> although is sometimes
helpful on a tutorial, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's very black and white. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is the tutorial not good? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Dislike. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, when it comes to like your videos, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like the dislike bar
doesn't serve the same purpose </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as it does on a tutorial, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where information is actually important. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it serves a
purpose when you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you really fucked up, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Again, that, again, there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or you've purposely
made a very controversial </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> opinion, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and the more I think about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the more I think, yeah, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> in some ways the dislike
and like bar is useless, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it doesn't mean anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> With 99% of videos, I think
it is completely useless, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and only with tutorials and
knowing when you fucked up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that's literally the only two reasons. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I mean, there
is also some catharsis </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to being able to dislike
a video, and just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes you see a video,
and it's so outrageous, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and you wanna know that you're
not the only fucking person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who thinks that this video is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that this is a shitty video or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you go to the dislike
bar and you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Thank God, I'm not the
only one," you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There is some catharsis. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like going into a video and seeing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comments are disabled, and
I'm just like, fuck you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah but that's way- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No balls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The like and dislike bar's like nothing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the comments that matter, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And when the come to the disabled, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I get way more than I do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, like to me, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't mind if you
disagree with an opinion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I make on a video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I would much rather
you leave a comment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> explaining why you dislike it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or why you are against
whatever I said in that video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rather than just like leaving a dislike. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because, again, as you said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a dislike can mean a
million different things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because sometimes people will be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "This video wasn't as
good as another one." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Does that mean that
that person disliked it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And is that like, fair? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause if I didn't like the
video that someone made, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or I liked another one more,
I wouldn't personally dislike. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- But that's how I do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So, to me trying to like
extrapolate any information </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from this random just metric
that doesn't mean shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like, it doesn't help me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, when I see a video
that has 99.9% likes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now I see a video with 99.8% likes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, what's the difference here? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, did it get more
likes than previously, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> or like, less dislikes? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't really understand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, I've never really- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, but I mean, like,
I think it is useful, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not in the small percentages, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but in the large percentages, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because most videos on
YouTube should have like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an above 90% like ratio,
like to dislike ratio. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's actually 99, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> is like normally good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 95 is where you're getting
to like, all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe have said something
low, a little bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If it's 10%, if you have 9 to 1 ratio, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you've probably fucked up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh no, you haven't fucked up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've just pissed off... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> My experience is you've
probably pissed off- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A certain group. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - A certain community or
a certain group, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you get to like the 50%, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's when you know that
something big has gone down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, 'cause your core
audience will always like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean that's really- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that doesn't
necessarily like, for example, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like a channel I like to
watch a lot of is "Needledrop" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who does like a lot of
music reviews, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> He's had a couple of recent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before the dislikes disappeared, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he's had a couple of
videos that were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 40% likes, but it was
still like a good video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just the thing,
his opinion about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously didn't coincide
with the general public. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, so but like, what does that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> as a viewer, what do I then
gather from that video? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, is this a bad video? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, does he say something
that's flat out wrong? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Does he say something that a lot of people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just don't agree with? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it doesn't really tell you anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in that scenario.
- It's a mixture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of all those, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's why you have to
go down into the comments </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> after that to be like, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> what is the reasoning
behind this massive dislike? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like YouTube removing
this way for viewers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to express themselves or
like the distaste of a video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're going to find other ways </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to express their distaste towards a video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I'm sure ratioing is just now- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ratio, yeah, ratio. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's going to now be a fuckin'
thing in the YouTubesphere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - As if it I wasn't
already fucking annoying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I can't wait to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> comments to like ratio
YouTube videos though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause that's just, that's
what's going to happen, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Viewers always find, like
audiences always find a way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to show you their dislike. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- It's either </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the YouTube comments are
gonna get more toxic, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or other social media platforms that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that particular YouTuber is known to be on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is gonna get more toxic behavior. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because like, the biggest
thing that annoys me is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the tutorials and stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you are very
much removing an easy way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to discern whether our tutorial is right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or whether a certain video is right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because let's say you
upload a shitty tutorial, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or you upload a scam, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You disabled comments, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but likes and dislikes is still available, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are still up in the open. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you're kind of just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're just kind of like taking a risk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on whether you should
listen to them, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because you don't know
how many people disabled. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - But also likes are very
easy to manipulate as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like that's another thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, but I would argue that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] At a smaller level. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but I would argue that now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can't even see
the dislikes anymore, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's not even point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of disabling likes and
dislikes anymore, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it's just in a
constant, disabled state, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it's like, you can only, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like say for example
there was a scam video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> If they disabled the comments, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now what's the only thing you can see? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is the likes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean.
- You can't do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like, I think
YouTube were trying to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> for something similar
to what Instagram did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with their likes about
making likes not public, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> except for the poster. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like for Instagram, I get it for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, for that platform,
I think it made sense because- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - They reverted it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The reversed it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did they? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait.
- When? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can see all the likes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, they reversed it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, they reverted it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they reverted it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Since how long? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like a long time now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Holy shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay well- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Were you still under the
impression that that was? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well we can see how often
Garnt goes on his Instagram. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's no big secret that
I don't go on Instagram, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I guess my point is now mute. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm glad you guys stopped
me before I was starting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before I was going to start
spewing a lot of bullshit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Speaker 3] Mine is not showing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, they show up for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They show up for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Speaker 3] You too? They don't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, they show up for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think they might be
slowly rolling it back out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or you have to like maybe
opt-in to it, or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, but. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, see? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That must be data that shows, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> on their end, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That like says, hey, when
people all see likes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's good for us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I don't know what that is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I can only speak to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's probably, if people can see likes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just keeps them on the platform, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because viewers wanna feel
like they're having some, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like they can contribute in
some way, shape, or form. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - They wanna see a metric, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they wanna see that metric go up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - With the YouTube one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the main speculation was
that brands weren't happy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> with the dislike box. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now, in some ways I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's too easy of an explanation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like, usually in the past, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think they've been
that catering of brands. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, I could be wrong here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like they must have
some data that backs up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that removing dislikes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> will lead to better views or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean.
- They must, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there's no way that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> YouTube's seems too selfish
to do something for brands. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It seems like, I feel
it just happens to be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, so the YouTube
creator's channel on YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> made a video, it was
like a three-minute video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that was like concise saying
why they were moving it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, was it the dude who's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is that the one that the
guy was like sitting there? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, the guys just
sitting there being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "This is the reason
why we're gonna do it." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Nice and quick, I give him props for that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> At least it wasn't like a fuckin' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 30-minute explanation video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they gave a number
- It sort of fuckin' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like Nickacado Avocado. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was nice and concise, which is nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But, yeah one of the
reasons they gave was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh yeah, we saw a metric
that we tested upon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> millions of users," don't
know how true that is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that apparently the amount of dislikes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> does not change the
watch time of that video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I believe that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I believe that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as well.
- Yeah, and I'm like, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd argue- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't really watch.
- That's not a reason though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get rid of it.
- To (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with dislikes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I argued being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> well yeah, what if you're
watching like an apology video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like 40 minutes long, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure there's a lot of dislikes on it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but people wanna see it until the end. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean you usually there's one priority, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's making people watch longer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so there must be some evidence </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to prove that getting rid of
it makes people watch longer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did find a funny though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that the last point
they gave that was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "And the last question is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> did we get rid of the dislike button </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because of YouTube rewind?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They brought that point by, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and dude, I've never seen a guy say no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with such coping in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He was like, "No." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You can see the coping in his eyes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You could see how many
times he had to film that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to sound genuine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get the most genuine
take that he could, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because he knew people were gonna be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> watching this under a microscope at like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 0.25 speed or something to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Well, the inflection in his voice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of leads me to believe that YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> made him say that."
- "I heard a slight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> vibrato in his voice, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> meaning he is about to
start crying at any minute." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just wish they
would tell us the truth, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and give us some data, but
they're not gonna do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Why would they?
- No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, what, like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> What, not annoyed me, but the way, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what really made me suspicious
was the way they framed it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like, "Oh, we're
doing you guys a favor." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You asked for this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't, don't, don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thank us later. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Please, please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hold the applause, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but we are helping you
for your mental health. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> literally no creator I have
talked to or ever heard of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> asked YouTube to do this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they framed it in a way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they're doing it for the creators. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Have you ever
seen a YouTube creator </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> make a video in front of the camera going, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Guys, my mental health is deteriorating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from all these dislikes
I'm getting, man, fuck." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, of course not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the fucking algorithm
that's demanding YouTuber's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to not take a break. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the one time a
corporation has said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Don't worry guys, we've heard you." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey cackling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The audience didn't actually say anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - We have been silent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You've had tape on our
mouths the entire time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> We can't say anything.
- That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Hey you guys, we're gonna
help you guys out here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's like, no one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even know why I'm here, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's literally the,
"I've saved the day," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "But you haven't done anything," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they just leave. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're welcome, see ya. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My God.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I've finally started to
settle in my new place now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh yeah? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we are-
- 20 years later. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - 20 years later, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Hosted the house warming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Unfortunately, Joey couldn't make it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you were busy with the. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was doing (indistinct), yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I will say, yeah.
- Lovely lasagna. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I will say, ever since that day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I don't know if I've told the story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the world-famous lasagna yet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which it's not world-famous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] But it's about to be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, now it's about to be, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so in Japan, I don't know why, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but you can get a lot of
good Italian food in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but for some reason you
just can't get lasagna. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, no Italian restaurant in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason, serves lasagna. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the few that they do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they definitely don't serve good lasagna. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So because of this, I would just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> look, I've been living
in Japan for a year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm craving lasagna. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So what better way to
do it than just learn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how to do it yourself? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll do it myself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> damn it.
- I fuckin', </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I literally fuckin' Thanos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll fuckin' do it myself, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So about a year ago. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't realize that
was a Thanos reference. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just said it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it a Thanos reference? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the one where
he takes the gauntlet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and says fine, I'll do it myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Speaker 4] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I haven't seen the movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I've just seen the meme. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a pretty famous meme. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the most generic line </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that could be attached to any character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can say anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can be like, "Oh my penis
is a little bit itchy." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> She's like, "I don't remember
when Thanos said that." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll do it myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll do it myself.
- All right, go on, tell it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So about a year ago, I
learned how to cook lasagna, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I cooked it once, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I cook it once, and it was
like a mediocre lasagna. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's a difficult dish, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Kind of.
- It's like lego, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but with pasta. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a pasta cake, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just concentrated
pasta, with meat of course. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it kind of is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's kind of what it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like all the flavor of pasta bowl, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> layered out very precisely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, yeah.
- Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, deep during quarantine, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes we would have dinner parties </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where we would invite people over, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or just people would come over. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And one day Sydney invites Connor over, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and she says, "Oh, you
can have some of Garnt's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> world-famous lasagna." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and Connor's just like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> What do you mean world-famous,
Cindy, I've cooked it once. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And ever since she said that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because she didn't say it to Connor, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she said it's a Mae Lynne as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And so for like a good five months, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people have built up this idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I make world-famous lasagna, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> right?
- It's just a joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just a joke. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's just out here like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> misinformation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would just drop people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Have you had Garnt's
world-famous lasagna? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so the first time I
actually cook it for Mae Lynne, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Mae Lynne's the one I
wanna please the most. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You want to get that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good Google review.
- Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of course, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because if you can please
Mae Lynne with a meal, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you can do anything.
- You know what's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's basically Michelin
star at that point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is world-famous, so
the first time I cook, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was at Mae Lynne's house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And when you're cooking in a kitchen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you're unfamiliar with, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with equipment that you don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes you have an
oven, or you don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, with Japanese ovens, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially the ones that aren't pre-built, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the ones that you buy,
they say a temperature, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but the actual temperature
varies depending on what oven </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and what brand you buy, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so I remember first
time I cooked this lasagna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the public was that Mae Lynne's house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For the public.
- For the public. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For the world. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so world-famous- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so world-famous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I was like fucking sweating, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because weeks before I come to
Mae Lynne's house to cook it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Mae Lynne was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Can't wait for the world famous lasagna." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm a give you a fucking Google review, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just to see if it is
actually world-famous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, for fuck's sake,
man, this joke has gone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> too far.
- The pressure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like cook for Gordon
Ramsey or something, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like I'm part of
like, "Kitchen Nightmares" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm cooking, I'm cooking
at Mae Lynne's house, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it takes a while
to cook lasagna, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it's not like an easy dish. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You gotta cook the meat sauce, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you gotta layer it up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I wasn't familiar
with Mae Lynne's oven. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd cooked it a bunch
of times in my own oven, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the first time I'm
cooking in Mae Lynne's oven. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Something that an
experienced chef would say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I cook it in Mae Lynne's oven, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and unfortunately it wasn't hot enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Her oven didn't go hot enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I liked it, I liked it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you had a crispy lasagna? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so I cook it, and- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A little al dente lasagna. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That ain't al dente, that's crispy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's the crispy one? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not al dente. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is al dente? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I just say shit.
- Al dente means </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the bite, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So it's like just right softness, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Italian's, please confirm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just say Italian words. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, just say them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was definitely- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mama mia.
- Star of Italy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I cook my lasagna mama mia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it wasn't fully cooked, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but the inside was definitely,
as Gordon Ramsey would say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking raw. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey giggling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, even if lasagna is like raw, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, this is still pretty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking good.
- It's a little, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't mind my lasagna a little crunchy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Connor enjoyed it, when I cooked some- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I am not picky about my lasagna. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> As long as you have all
the ingredients in there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, the meat sauce is pretty good, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but Mae Lynne, nothing
goes past Mae Lynne. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She takes one bite and
she's like, "This is raw." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "This is raw," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like.
- Without the energy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of Gordon Ramsay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just like, ah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> my cooking career is over
after one dish, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is it, this is it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Big sad, big sad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna put up my apron now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm never gonna cook again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just glad I got to
experience the "Ratatouille" movie, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in like, real time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And so that was the last
time I cooked a lasagna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for other people to taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it actually deterred you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until, until, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until this housewarming party </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where Sydney obviously invites, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, Sydney invites everyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And she sends people this menu as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> things that we were going to cook, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, Sydney,
why would you do that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And without my knowledge, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she said I would be cooking
the world-famous lasagna, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> literally on the menu, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right?
- She was trying to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bring the old man out of retirement, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and try and get him back in the game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like a retired hero
or something, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like Sydney- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - "I haven't done that in years." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "I'm past my prime, now I can't do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't do it, Sydney. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't make me do it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> She's like, "Garnt, it's out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Mae Lynne's coming, you
need to do it," right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And so like, I'm like sweating now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So a few days before the lasagna, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a few days before the housewarming,
I have a practice run. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually got so
nervous that I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to practice it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My lasagna making skills
are a little rusty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to get back on the pedestal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see how it is done again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so, yeah, so- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need some oil in these bones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so I did my lasagna
and Sydney loves it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'm just like, I can do
better, I need to do better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I must confer the beyond. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I make some mental notes before the day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about the small changes I'm
going to make to the recipe, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the small changes I'm gonna make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the preparation and everything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and so the day comes, and- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like you're going
to like a bake-off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is, it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This ain't no joke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, imagine cooking
for Mae Lynne, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] I would never dare to- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's your own personal recipe, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know?
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I think I would actually rather cook </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for Gordon Ramsey at this point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so everyone comes, everyone comes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and everyone has all the
different side dishes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We have some meat boards,
we have some other things, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but the lasagna is the main dish, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like, everyone's having a merry time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm fuckin' sweating, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not just because of
the heat from the oven, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I'm sweating out of nerves, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You did look very nervous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I do remember you looking really worried. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember everyone coming in, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone coming in, Sydney
just greeting everyone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and everyone's being so short. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Don't talk
to me, don't talk to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm making lasagna right
now, I'm making lasagna." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Connor's like, "Yo Garnt,
can I see your office?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, "No Connor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll show you after I
finish this fucking lasagna, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I'll be social and
then I'll be a good host. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But until the lasagna's
done, nothing is happening." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so, and so I cook the lasagna. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's an hour after Sydney had said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that the lasagna would be finished. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't care. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't rush perfection. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I finish it,
and then I take it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then this is a
really weird experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> People start crowding
around this lasagna, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, it's like, oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, people started
crowding around this lasagna, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm gonna say, it looked
fucking good, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] I mean, I saw the photos, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it looked good.
- There's the thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about lasagna, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Anyone who loves lasagna will understand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that the first spatula, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first serving is always the best one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because the more people start
chunking out that lasagna, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the more sloppy it becomes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't get me wrong, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not like lasagna is
the cleanest thing on earth, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the first spatular
scoop is the best one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You get the perfect ratio. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause like, I needed to make sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the cheese was like perfectly toasted, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause it can't be like raw cheese. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And the edges need to be
like a little bit crispy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a little bit burned, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To me, that's a good lasagna. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, of course, of course,
- You can't have like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a completely raw, but not
too overburned lasagna. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I remember, I
remember finishing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone was taking pictures. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Mae Lynne,
have the first taste." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey wheezing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The spotlight comes on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The room is silent, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I give her the dish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She takes one bite. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's just like the longest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fuckin' few seconds of my life, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I see her chewing this
lasagna, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my life is like flashing
before my eyes right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she's just like, "Oh
shit, you've leveled up." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (crew laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey singing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't explain the fucking euphoria </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that just went over my body. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey screaming) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was very good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was literally that Japanese going... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt yelling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was good lasagna, it was very good, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to say, I can confirm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It was great lasagna. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a lost "Food Wars" episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was.
- I'll be honest, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't remember any of the
other food that was there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember the lasagna.
- Damn, must be good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And there was sandwiches. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> miniature sandwiches.
- Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know there was a menu, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but I can't remember
anything else on the menu. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what does it matter when you
had the world-famous lasagna? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just wanted Mae Lynne to
be really pretentious about it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Al dente." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm sure she had a childhood
flashback when she ate it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe, I hope so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But ever since that point, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> "Damn, cooking's fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cooking for other people can be fun." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Who would've thought. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so ever since
that, ever since then, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me and Sydney had been
cooking almost like every day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So we used to like Uber
Eats almost every day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a big thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a big deal is because we
do have a dishwasher now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so we don't have to wash
dishes ourselves anymore, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that takes so much of the effort out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the cooking process, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I find cooking relaxing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I actually find it relaxing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to chop up the onions or chop
up the vegetables or whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> prepare the dish, cook the dish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the clearing up that is
always putting me off cooking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Ever since I've gotten the dishwasher, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cooking has actually been an
enjoyable experience for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I feel the more I'm doing it now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I used to fuckin' dread it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it was just stressful, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> even following the menu or the recipe, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somehow I fucked it up in some regard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm following the recipe, how
does this taste like shit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But now the more I'm
like, (indistinct) cook, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, trying out
really easy pastas and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something that is very difficult
to fuck up kind of thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's kind of fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Is this what it feels like
to be good at something? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's just like, when you
see people eating your meal, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're just enjoying
it and feeling happy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, oh, this is how chefs feel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I found like a
new hobby or something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's genuinely a good feeling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to cook something that you're proud of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and people also enjoy your cooking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Mom, I get it, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just saying.
- I get why you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was always like Eagle-eyed on me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever I'd eat any of your meals. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, I get it now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like cooking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just a lot of work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is.
- But also, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm also really bad with
portion control, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I make food, I make food, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a lot of food.
- Like a feast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I used to make a lot of lasagna, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but the problem was is that
I would then eat lasagna- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You make a lasagna? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But is it world-famous? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nobody's had it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well now I'm curious,
Connor, now I'm curious </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how your lasagna is.
- We're about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to have a lasagna-off, aren't we? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One time I made a
lasagna, and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, I totally forgot to
make the white sauce layer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I was like, why does
this taste like bricks? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause there was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> no white layers to balance
out the tomato shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, so I would have to make lasagna. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I always liked leftover
lasagna more than lasagna. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really?
- Something about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> lasagna sometimes that like the next day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> when you heat it up, it's just perfect. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it's so thick, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so thick, it kind of gets, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, try it, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like-
- I have tried it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I like it.
- It's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how leftover deep dish pizza tastes better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> than the fresh deep dish pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, sometimes, I don't know why, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but at least the lasagna that I made. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know, maybe it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something I'm figmenting.
- Are you talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> about microwaved lasagna, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> or do you just eat it straight
out with the fuckin' fridge? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Properly made lasagna. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then I would like, put it back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in the oven.
- The next day, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, put it back in the oven? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It just tastes good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think maybe it's because like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the juices are like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seeping.
- Coagulated? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Are you talking about solid? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It like seeps in, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You could cut through it like a cake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whereas normal lasagna,
it goes fuckin' everywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which, don't get me wrong, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I generally prefer the normal lasagna, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but somehow when I used to make it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that for some reason I
liked it the day after more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I get that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, it's like curry, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Curry the day off to tastes
just as good as the day before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I've heard that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like the biggest
fallacy I've ever heard, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I've had day-old curry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that definitely doesn't
taste as good as like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What kind of curry though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Indian curry, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I understand why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Indian curry may not be the same, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because with Japanese curry, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's definitely better the day after. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because it's taken the time
for everything to seep in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So are you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> sorry, go on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like I was talking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japanese curry tastes
the same no matter what, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel.
- Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel.
- You think so? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like I've never had bad curry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but I've never had curry
that's made me like amazed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about how good it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is the most like, 6 out of 10 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of.
- The special gourmet ones, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where they use like really rich stock, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and they have really
good quality beef pies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - At the end of the day, it's still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese curry.
- It's still Japanese curry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With pizza, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was wondering about this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because you know there's
people who are like purists, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that like stone-baked, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where is it from? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Napoli, Napoli? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Napoli.
- Napoli. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, "That's the only style. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the correct style." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which type of pizza is
your favorite style? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just curious, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because-
- Stone-baked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Stone-baked? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I do like stone-baked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Stone-baked is the only pizza
where I can eat the crust. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because some like,
sourdough stone-baked pizza? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, it's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm a crust hater, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm a eat that fuckin' crust. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm the same.
- And I'm gonna enjoy it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - American pizza is the
best pizza, I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, what kind of American pizza? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like a New York pizza,
that's like the best pizza. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - To be fair, New York pizza
is pretty fuckin' bomb. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think American style of
making pizza is the best way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I love stone-baked, I
love stone-baked, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I love it, don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But like, I don't know what
it is about American toppings. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Italians, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I hear you Italians, I felt- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Listen, listen, all right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - A whole generation just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> died right there.
- Here's my argument, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The thing with stone-baked pizza </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that sometimes kind of pisses me off, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why are they so goddamn
light with the toppings? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, they put like one pepperoni on it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and call it a day, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which I get it, you don't
want to like submerge it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But also, everything falls
off like, immediately as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so nothing stays in place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and they put like, no fucking cheese on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Isn't that based off like the, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's either the Napoli or the
other type of a Italian pizza. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, it's not supposed
to be a heavy meal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's supposed to be very, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> very light.
- I love when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's heavy.
- I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which one it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love the heaviness of American pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it's all like a nice- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - By American pizza, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because there's so many different types </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of American pizza.
- The American style </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of making pizza is like
the, from what I understand, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like New York where it's like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Like Dominos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's like perfectly
constructed, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where it's this slice that like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is very solid on its own,
like when it's cut up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> nothing like falls off, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nothing like fuckin'
slips off or anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a nice, solid bit of pizza. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I love it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Also, one thing I tried, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I thought was gonna
be disgusting, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is vile, I know it sounds gross. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Hear me out, all right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I had this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you like the grease? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you like the grease? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, so... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hold on, hold on, hold on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm listening, I'm listening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I tried the hot dog in the crust pizza, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and fucking I loved it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, like a sausage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like a hot dog in the
crust, I really enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you like cheesy crust? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, but I liked the hot dog one more. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like an extra meal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But what if you put the
cheese inside of the hotdog, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and you put that in the crust? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's just not even a crust anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like whenever people say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "But do you eat stuffed crust? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Stuffed crust is good." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Stuff crust is what you
eat when you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you don't wanna
actually eat crust, okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a mozzarella stick, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay?
- Okay yeah, I know that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is just a fucking hot dog, okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're eating a pizza
with a hot dog at the end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like hot dogs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I like the hot dogs.
- That sounds amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like the hot dog. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You can get it in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, Pizza Hut did it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're not gonna pretend
that this is better </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> than stone-baked pizza, or
like fresh fuckin' pizza? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, yes.
- Okay, but in Japan, though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> No fucking way am I
listening to this right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Japan, there's two types
of pizza in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's pizza, and then there's pizza. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> All right, two different things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You guys laugh, but it is true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We got like an hour
left on this recording, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can we order a Pizza Hut pizza
with sausage in the crust? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually wanna try it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just saying, we should do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> We should all have a live reaction. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - One, because I wanna see your reaction. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I want to see your reaction.
- I've had hotdog crust pizza. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a hot dog crust pizza. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - On camera? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Have you had it on camera? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] I've never tried it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I want to see Joey </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> try it.
- How have you never tried it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I barely eat cheesy crust. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I just want like, a regular crust. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm pretty sure they have it, man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm telling you.
- Why don't you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like cheesy crust? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's too heavy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you want a hotdog crust? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, it's like, it's so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like a very tight hot dog. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like wrapped around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a bite-sized hot dog. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a hotdog burrito. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, it's so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I hope they have it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I need to check if they still have it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's two types of pizza, there's pizza, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like stuff like
Pizza Hut, Domino's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> American pizza basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then this pizza,
which is the Italian pizza. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like if you ever go
to like an Italian-like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> restaurant or whatever, or establishment, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll be able to know the difference </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> between like the Italian, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like stone-baked stuff that Garnt likes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then the American
stuff that Connor likes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - At least Japan has
made a distinction being, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, at least they're
not one of those countries </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that are like, "All pizza is the same." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I remember when I
first went to New York, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I had my first like New York pizza, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and the selling point
of this pizza was that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you could literally tilt-
- It's as big as your face. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You could literally tilt the pizza, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you could see the oil dripping off it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, how
is this a selling point? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're meant to make this appetizing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just pure fat that's
like rolling off now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I went to a place
in New York that was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess like kind of famous in New York. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I forgot what it was, but like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're famous for like
dabbing the oil off the pizza. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Off the pizza? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it's really, really,
it's a massive pizza, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's really thin and really light. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So like, I don't know about the full, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whole like, oil dripping off thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like if that was the selling point, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I wouldn't eat it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But the point is you're
still dabbing off the oil, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because there is so much oil on the pizza. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And to me, that's not appetizing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like when I see that much oil on anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just, I don't wanna eat it, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can feel my arteries just clogging up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> from eating this.
- As much as like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a place called
Pizza Slice in Shibuya </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's really good, that
does a New York style pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuckin' bomb. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can only go there maybe
like once a month though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because my God, after two slices, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like about to explode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look, I get it where, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I get that it's a nice fast meal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It feels good, it feels unhealthy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But to say that it is better
than stone-baked pizza. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's where I draw the line, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No fuckin' way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I had to choose, oh God, so hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just liked pizza in general. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's all delicious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's all delicious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not saying that
stone-baked is not delicious, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not saying that New
York pizza is not delicious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> as well in its own way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I love.
- Because like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> both types of pizza have their benefits. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause the only thing- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - One, it can be an everyday meal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The only pizza that I'd
say the Americans do the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is Chicago pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The deep dish stuff, right?
- Deep dish stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But like, that's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that's not even nowhere else even does it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a pie, that's a pie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's it's a pizza lasagna,
but it's a pizza lasagna. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what Chicago deep dish pizza is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's fucking amazing.
- It's got these squared. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> Joey with the outro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Back to the show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For me, there's something
about the fillingness </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> of an American pizza
style that I love so much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, I get that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I love, I really, really miss </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Domino's pizza in the UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I love that piece. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's different about it in the UK? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why it's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's just biased. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it just tastes the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've had Domino's around like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lots of different places, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they all kind of taste the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I had Little Caesar's pizza in America. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I thought it was delicious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The mini-pizzas? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, the big ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, the big ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This was like $5 for like a large, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everyone was saying like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Bro, it's like the worst pizza on earth." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's not- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I actually like, liked it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like oven pizza a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not really great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had it in America as well.
- I liked it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I liked it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd much rather Domino's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than Little Caesars.
- I like Little Caesars. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And also- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just convinced you
don't have tastebuds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The more you talk,
the more I'm just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Also, my enjoyment of it also increases </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> knowing that for all of
that for $5, that's insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's got nothing to do
- That's got nothing to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - With the taste.
- With the taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But the taste is good, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's only heightened by
the fact that it's simply $5 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> for this massive food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like this could feed the
entire fucking last supper, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this little Caesar's pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because it's not that great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why.
- That doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> effect the taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it does. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We go to a place, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> The price affects the
way you see the food. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, and that's exactly
why Little Caesars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tastes like $5 pizza,
and it's not that great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You get a dollar slice in New York, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it is foolish of me to act like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> knowing it was $1 didn't
contribute to my enjoyment vessel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, of course, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you don't go to a New
York pizza place and be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I would like an exquisite
meal right now please, $1? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, what a steal." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it because stone-baked
pizzas are not big enough? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is one big factor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that it?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, hypothetically, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you found a restaurant
here in Japan, or wherever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that does stone-baked sourdough pizza </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was the size of a New York pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But also they skimp out on
the toppings a lot, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Japan, they definitely do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But if you've had like
stone-baked in England? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like in Europe?
- In Italy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and a lot of the time they skimp out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, "You don't
put enough toppings on." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, the sauce is
generous enough, I'd say. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But like cheese? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, come on man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had stone-baked in Italy,
and they stacked that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I haven't been to Italy, but like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the best stone-baked pizza places I go to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they don't skimp on the cheese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They don't skimp on the toppings. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause you're in like
a British version of it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so they fix it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - The one I had in
Northern Italy was packed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Was it really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every time I've had one in Italy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's been like, very lacking in toppings. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think you go
into the right places. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like as the person who is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the biggest simp for bread, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how does that not play a factor
in how these pizzas taste? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, So that's more of a, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would say stone-baked in many aspects. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in my mind, it's more
about enjoying the bread </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than it is about the pizza. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I don't even consider it- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like to a point where I'm like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's flavored bread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd rather just get like,
bread, like, at this point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just give me a real fuckin' pizza, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If it doesn't give me like
five spots the next day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it isn't a pizza. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna be fucked up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck me up with this pizza. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> The board's right, British
people don't have taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's confirmed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm team America with this one, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm American all the way on this one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> American pizza goes hard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a time and a
place for an American pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hands down.
- Every day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - There is a time and a
place for American pizza, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but it is not the superior pizza. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] It is not the superior- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not the superior pizza.
- It is superior. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - America, I salute you with your pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Okay then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your pizza slaps. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Keep doing it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Okay, let's see how, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, then question, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which one's better, Japanese
sushi or American sushi? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'ma head out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Well no, obviously Japan does it better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Sushi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So like, if I was to
give you a choice of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just standard like regular
tuna that you get a like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a composition here, or a California roll, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which one would you choose? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I feel like compare, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I feel like the end of the day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a pizza, a stone-baked pizza, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and a pizza are like the same shit, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What you've said. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But, a sushi roll is not
even remotely like sushi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Come on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You cannot sit here me dead in the eye </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and tell me that you think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, Connor, what you've basically said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is basically like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> sweet and sour chicken
is the best Chinese food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Orange chicken. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Orange chicken is the best. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Chicken tikka masala is the
best Indian curry, in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I am not going to stand here
and listen to this bullshit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've had, okay right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've had both pizzas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm becoming in honorary
Italian for like a fuckin' day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't care.
- Just to call you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> out on your fucking bullshit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> The rest of the episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I lose my Italian fan
base for this, so be it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You guys have shit pizza
compared to the Americans. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Come on.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just can't get over the fact that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's trace it back to World War II. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just kidding. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like with sushi and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like a lot of the
sushi is not even close. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even think that's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How is it not close? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They use the same ingredients. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A lot of the time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the ingredients aren't even similar, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I think.
- Everything inside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of a California roll, they
use in regular sushi here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do they really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just not together. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's in the California roll? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are the ingredients
of California roll? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's salmon. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You sounded so confident. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's salmon, cucumber. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Does roll- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, rolls in general are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> an American thing.
- So different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so different from sushi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wouldn't say stone-baked is that far off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from normal pizza.
- But Japan has rolls as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do they really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- No, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but they don't have
the same kind of rolls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not the same kinds- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's lot of fried shit, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Nothing like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - From what I've seen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Japanese rolls are just
like one fish in a roll, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's it.
- I feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is a dumb argument,
but I'm ready to die for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's "Trash Taste" though, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It ain't "Trash Taste"
without a food argument. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just, I'm watching
a man commit suicide, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "All right, you can kinda,
you jump off the cliff." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't say I didn't try to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> grab you and warn you that this is a cliff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're jumping off of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think a lot of the
viewers will agree with me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that American pizza is
better than Italian. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> First of all, we have
an American audience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and it's because I guarantee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that there are more Americans
watching this than Italians, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there are more people who have been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to America than Italy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've been to both. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes, yes, yes.
- Still more pie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Actually, yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Crew Member] A California
roll is not Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I know.
- We know that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What are the ingredients? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it the? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Crew Member] Imitation crab. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which they have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which they have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You don't get crab on
sushi normally though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- You don't really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, of course you do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not that often. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I get it all the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really, where?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - In any sushi tray. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You get the crab head in the thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you never get like crab. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You get crab on it, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really, I've never seen this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is the man who just said
that meat sushi didn't exist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> even though he's had it, so I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - To be fair, I still don't
view it when I go to get sushi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not exactly the most
reliable narrator, this man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> America pizza's better than stone-baked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll die on the hill.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is just like a bad
person making a good argument. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like people just gonna disagree with me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I'm fuckin' dumb. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not a good argument.
- It's a great argument. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not a good.
- It's a great argument. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's quite in fact the opposite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You're a good person with a shit argument. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is a preferential thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I just think the pizza's better. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not flat out being wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look, I'm not saying
American pizza is bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love American pizza.
- This is not what we are, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> arguing by the way.
- Both pizzas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> are fantastic in their </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> own unique ways.
- But to act like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is so far beyond
belief to it even insist </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that American pizza could be interpreted </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as better than stone-baked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, that's just a wild claim. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not wild. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> People like American pizza
more than stone-baked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Because they've
never had stone-baked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - They have had stone-baked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want to see how many people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think you'll be shocked
by the amount of viewers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that actually think American </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is better than stone-baked.
- How many of our viewers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who have had both can agree with you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and say that the American- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Your head's in the clouds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Would you say Domino's is
better than stone-baked pizza? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - In my mind, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I would rather Domino's pizza
than a stone-baked pizza. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - What?
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I have seen, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember, I remember as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I felt so gratified like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hey yo, give this man some taste buds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I felt so relieved, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which, who's that guy who
was like 1500 Netflix shows? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The, I think he's a chef
from, I think Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but he's he's American. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The bearded guy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, I forgot his name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was one scene, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Where he was doing a
whole thing about pizza, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he went around reviewing
all different types of pizza. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there was one scene where he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "You know, at the end of the day though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there's just something
about a Domino's pizza </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just go so hard." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, yes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's probably a reason why
we don't remember his name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pretending like Domino's pizza, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or these like fast food
pizza taste like shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you're just clowning.
- I never said that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - We never said that.
- We never said that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like saying a McDonald's burger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is better than like a
gourmet freshly made burger </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at a burger joint, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, yes, there's a place for it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but to say that as better is like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've had many burgers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where I would prefer
the McDonald's burger, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> over said burger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well yes, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because a lot of the time
they're just like, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's just get some like good beef. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's just like, not consider
the ratios or anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We should put like, shit on it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's put like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 500 crumbs of bacon.
- What I'm saying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the argument we're making
is think of the best burger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've ever had that wasn't McDonald's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and put that next to a McDonald's burger, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> which one would you rather?
- But I've had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of pizza in Italy
that wasn't stone-baked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that I think was much
better than stone-baked, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I was more into it
than American style. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, it's like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like the heaviness of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- Stone-baked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't the only type of pizza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But to me, definitely,
it is like the pinnacle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I fucking love stone-baked.
- Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] It's the best bread. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's because it's like the best bread, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the best cheese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is coming from a man
who can't appreciate the crust. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> This comes with like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like you've
already tainted the pizza </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> with shit tasting crust.
- It's because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't eat the crust
that I can appreciate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> a fucking good stone-baked, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's the only
pizza that I eat the crust, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> okay?
- I just feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have, like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like watching a
vegan eat a chicken wing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, oh my God, it's a monumental, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it must be really fucking good chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You don't even appreciate bread, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So how can you even have an
opinion on what's better pizza? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, you don't have a core fundamental </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of bread.
- No, no, no, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, I don't
appreciate 90% of bread, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because to me, 90% of bread
tastes the fuckin' same, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's like.
- Okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'ma have to stop you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right here, bro.
- You cannot say that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was on your side until you said that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like me going, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Bro, every fuckin' rice and noodles </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is the fuckin' same, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, let's just get." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Udon is exactly the same as fuckin'- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why is it no different
from instant noodles? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bro, it's 90% the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like 90% of the ramen noodles- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't think you could be
racist towards white people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But in that moment, I
think you genuinely were. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think that was actually racist
towards white people, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - French people clutching
their baguettes right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - French folk? Germans
are losing it right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's half of German food, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We got to do a "Trash Taste" special </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where we just take Garnt
to a German bakery, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he just he's like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't know you could have
15 different types of bread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you saying that a pretzel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tastes the same as a baguette? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is pretzel bread? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] What kind of? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yes, it's bread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not the little fuckin' hard
like, cookie-esque ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like pretzels.
- Like an actual pretzel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna be honest. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What are you about to say? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm gonna be honest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> A pretzel to me is just a salted baguette. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- That's what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it tastes like to me.
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What?
- That's that's kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what it tastes like to me.
- What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What?
- Okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bread.
- Bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, to me, I can't eat bread. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is how World War III begins. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - To me, I can't eat bread
by itself a lot of times, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it needs to be flavored, okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It needs to have some butter on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, for example, a baguette, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I need some butter with that baguette. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love the times, okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Pretzels, they have salt, okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, you can't just eat a baguette. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, a good baguette? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - With butter? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, just a baguette. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Just eat it by itself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't fuckin' eat
a baguette by itself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> That's just like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You just blew off all
of your fuckin' audience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this is episode, Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You like, won the Italians,
and then throw them away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck, Garnt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're furious.
- No, no, no, no, no- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even the Italians are doing this right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We need to on a European tour, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> fuckin' actually have- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bye-bye Europe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - With the crust, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're not eating, you
know, it's not like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have the pizza pie with the cheese, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the toppings and everything, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you have the crust part, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That's a very small ratio
to the whole pizza itself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't eat a pizza-sized
crust no matter how good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the fuckin' stone-baked crust is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can just chow down
on a whole baguette, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like straight down,
when it's good quality? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I don't even need-
- Pretzel as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, if it's lightly salted, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't even don't even need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mustard with that.
- I don't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you've had good bread, Garnt, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> genuinely.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think you, if you had fresh bread, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like good bread, I think
you'd change your mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fresh bread is good, but like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - What like fuckin' tesco bread? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, no, I've had fresh bread, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but bread to me is-
- What fresh bread? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm skeptical now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where have you had this fresh bread? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, so you- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You had fresh bread yesterday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] That was fuckin' great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Could I eat more than just
the slice that we got? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was too much, and with the slice? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, I fuckin'- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I could have destroyed that whole plate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, fuck no.
- Yeah, I coulda </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had that bread.
- That's way to good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every time I go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an Italian restaurant in America- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've had many meals where
I have enjoyed the bread, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like an amount where honestly, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if the rest of my food didn't
come out, I would be happy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, every time I go to an
Italian restaurant in America, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they always give
you the plate of bread. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like more, I need more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> This is not gonna be enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bread, to me, is a starter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It is a starter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It is not the meal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't just have bread as a meal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] This man would not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have survived.
- I don't know who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm offending wit this take right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The entire middle ages. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Peasants in the 1800's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't just have like,
pure bread as a meal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm pretty sure like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you were born in
the 1700's in Europe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you would be so dead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] I didn't think
we're gonna have another </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> food episode.
- They're like, "Bread? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> For dinner?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys may be such a
big deal fuckin' deal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about this pizza thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I didn't think it was a big deal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No one means this shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And this man walks in here being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Bread is shit," like, straight up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't even have like a
gluten allergy or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> or some shit like that to hide behind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't say bread was shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I said, "Bread is not a meal." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You said "90% of bread," </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I quote, "tastes the same." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor sighing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, I'm gonna go back
on that statement, okay? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You better recant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that statement.
- 90% of bread </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> does not taste the same.
- How much percent? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> How much percent? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I mean like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Grade 87%. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Name a percent, Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, with bread, I
can't have bread as a meal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's like having pure rice as a meal, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay?
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - As an Asian, I can't
just have a rice as a meal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I know people can just
have rice as a meal, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you need to fucking
seasoning on the rice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so different.
- You need some flavoring. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You need something to go with the rice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can have rice as a meal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] I know you can, but now- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I know you can, but would you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bread doesn't fill
the same role as rice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It literally does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it doesn't.
- It literally does. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No it doesn't, it doesn't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll completely disagree that
all bread tastes the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or whatever, but I can agree
that all rice tastes the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I would say most rice- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That is... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is different types of rice, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - But, like rice.
- Obviously, I can tell </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the difference between like Japanese rice, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and like saffron rice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But there's like, rice pudding
and all that shit as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's all nonsense, but. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is rice pudding even rice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at that point?
- I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> comparing the roles that
bread and rice fill is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no, it's completely different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's totally different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't believe you're Japanese, Joey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're going to say that
all rice tastes the same, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where a huge part of
Japanese cuisine is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the subtle differences
in how the rice tastes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hey yo, that's all bullshit there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all marketing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's all marketing, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] I will agree with- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every time you go to a
fuckin' Dukan or anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and you get like the massive meal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they bring out the bowl of rice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're like, this
is the top branded rice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of this prefecture, and I take a bite, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, "Bro, this tastes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly the same." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You are wrong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It does not taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the same.
- It tastes exactly the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're chowing down on it
too fucking fast to appreciate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the subtle fuckin' taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's literally just carbs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what bread is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what bread is.
- No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally just carbs.
- No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's literally just carbs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so much more than that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whereas rice is just pure starch, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Bread has so much more that goes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into making a good bread, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You've got all the different ingredients, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that go into making it.
- I'm afraid to say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Rice is just like a hundred
percent starch, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because there is subtle
differences into how to cook rice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, but like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if we brought out two
bowls of rice, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And one was from like
fuckin' Akita prefecture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You wouldn't tell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the difference.
- And another one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from another prefecture, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I could not tell you
the fuckin' difference. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's not just
about the type of rice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's how you cook it as
well, which is why sushi rice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tastes different depending on
which sushi place you go to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sushi rice tastes different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's got vinegar in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's cooked with vinegar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's seasoned with vinegar, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right?
- Yeah, obviously. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so it's part
of the cooking process. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But if there was two
bowls of sushi rice, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one from Akita and one from Nagano, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't tell the difference. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's like saying you
have two pieces of bread </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were cooked exactly the same, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then they taste the
same, which they would, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they're cooked
exactly the same way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's-
(Joey cackling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like both of these
arguments are fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to make sense-
- I just realized. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of both arguments here, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm losing my mind.
- I just realized. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm losing my mind to this
fuckin' conversation now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I do agree that
rice is less, what's the word? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Diverse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah, diverse than bread. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, the bread has way too many. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm saying, like my core argument </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that I can't eat bread as a meal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's the same way as
eating rice as a meal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I genuinely believe you
haven't had good bread, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like genuinely.
- I have had good bread. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think you have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was the bread we had yesterday good? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was, even compared to German bread, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's mid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was it good bread yesterday? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought was kind of good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was good, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't get me wrong, it was good bread, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but, I'm telling you, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I been to- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never been to Germany,
so I don't know, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, I spent a lot
of my childhood in Germany, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I can tell you,
man, it's fuckin' good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so good.
- I bet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every time we go a German
restaurant, it's like, amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the only thing that
Germany does well, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Is the three foods that
Germany specialize in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> beer, which is food there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not a drink, it's a food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have bread, and then you have meat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> The meat is good, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sausages.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fucking amazing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Great sausages. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a reason why
they stick to three things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they fucking do it amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The bread is insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone's like French baguettes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, like French baguettes
can fuck themselves, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> German bread is like
20,000 light years ahead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not even comparable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So could you, what if you
could have bread as a meal, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> why don't you then? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're saying you want variation, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You want like, different things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, if you just have bread every, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, you will get bored, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I can easily have bread
occasionally as a full meal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I needed to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - If it was German bread,
yeah, no qualms about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, if it was German bread, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess.
- Like a fresh pretzel? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, if you give me like
three pretzels just by itself, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not like no mustard or anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Give me a beer too? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Give me a beer with that, oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I need a stronger taste than just bread. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because you haven't had good bread. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You haven't had a good- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have had good bread. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No matter how good the bread is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't eat a bread as an entire meal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're going to Germany.
- You know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're going to Germany. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Go to Germany, get a good pretzel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can appreciate good bread, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can appreciate a good slice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before the actual meal comes up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before the actual serving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of whatever dish I've ordered comes out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you know, a bread is a good starter, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gets the pallet going, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but can I eat an entire? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If I go to a restaurant and I'm like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're lucky we have a
Russian, not a German dub. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll tell you that, Garnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Waiter, I would like to
order an entire plate of bread, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and nothing else." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, no, I can't do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why you go to the bakery. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't go to the restaurant for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a piece of bread.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a big bakery that
serves exclusively bread. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can I get like, bacon there too? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, cut out the middleman, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, made for people
who want bread as a meal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> perhaps, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my fucking God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're exhausted now, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I am exhausted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't wait for this fucking
hotdog crust to turn up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] I wanna try this shit, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so good.

<SPEAKER_05> try this shit. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_00> - [Sydney] Also, I just wanna say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Garnt, that you said every beer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or not beer, bread, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you make it, it'll taste the same, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if it has the ingredients. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Actually, it's been
proven that when an air, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like bread rises, the air surrounding it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> depending on the region,
completely changes the taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor mockingly singing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So shut the hell up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sydney.
- Can we put </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> this in the episode?
- Sydney, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're meant to be on my side. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Sydney] No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sydney, Sydney. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Put it in, Bruda. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Sydney] And then you put in- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Justice has been served. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't believe I've
been betrayed by this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sydney, we're meant to be a fuckin' team. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Top 10 anime betrayals. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Sydney] No, because
you're also saying like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you guys are say like
rice tastes the same, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what kind of fucking like, honestly? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, rice does taste the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Rice does taste the same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't taste the same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Sydney] The complete difference between </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thai rice, Japanese rice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Thank you.
- But all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese rice tastes the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, but all rice does
not taste the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it does. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> All Japanese rice tastes the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, all Japanese rice tastes the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You guys are fooling yourselves. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It all tastes the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's all a marketing ploy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's all a marketing ploy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't believe that shit when
they tell you at the rural con. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They could be giving
you fuckin' hundred yen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like microwave packaged
rice for all I care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but while we're
waiting for the hotdog crust, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I do have a story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Go on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That finishes the lasagna
arc, lasagna story arc. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, it's not even like a,
it's like a side story now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So after our housewarming party, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we got a pretty merry, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there was one thing I
had forgotten about Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because in my previous place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I lived on like a high enough floor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I didn't need to worry
about bugs or wildlife </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or that kind of thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because nothing could
ever reach the top floor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of my apartment at the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I forgot that Japan
has cockroaches, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They sure do, guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Most countries do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had completely forgotten </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that Japan had cockroaches, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And what we found out
was during the party, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we didn't close one of our windows fully. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So the window was slightly ajar, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and we had left the food out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because unlike in Thailand
where we were taught </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to clean up everything every day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because cockroaches can come, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> living in a house, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had forgotten that cockroaches can come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we are living on the bottom floor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where a lot of cockroaches
are, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it's a pretty new house, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so we didn't have to
worry about that before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I didn't notice this,
or I didn't know this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until me and Sydney were
having dinner the next day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we'd cooked a nice meal, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because Sydney had cooked a nice meal, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and we were enjoying this
curry that she had cooked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we were like chowing down, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I look over, and
in the corner of my eye, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I see a black speck move about, all right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I move over and I look over, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there's a fat fucking cockroach. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How fat are we talking? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's about that size. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] That's pretty,
that's a decent size. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a decent sized </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> cockroach.
- Just moved in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I had just moved in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I literally got PTSD, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because if you don't remember, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had had a previous experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with a cockroach in Thailand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] The famous cockroach story? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you wanna check that out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a clip where I tell the story, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I had had a previous
experience in Thailand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with a cockroach, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it wasn't a pleasant
experience at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember seeing this cockroach, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Sydney was like, chatting away to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she was like, "Garnt...Garnt?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just, like, I was just silent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just staring at this cockroach. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor singing suspensefully)
And then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> she like starts getting angry, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Garnt, listen to me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she says that, and
then she looks over, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we're just
both staring in silence. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it's as if the cockroach knew </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we were looking at it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was flexing, because as
soon as Sydney looks over, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just crawls away into
the air conditioning </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in one of the holes,
and it just disappears. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And me and Sydney are just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How do we burn this entire house down? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We can't burn this entire house down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We just moved into this place," right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The cockroach literally
did an understandable, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "Have a nice day," to you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just going off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And me and Sidney were
just sitting here in silence. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We were like war veterans, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because we were just like,
we literally escaped- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not this again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We literally escaped this country, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we literally escaped Thailand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so we didn't have to
experience this again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And here we are moved into our new place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where we've been here for like a month, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we have a single
cockroach in our house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck, what do we do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we sit there for
about an hour being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well, do we move out again? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is that a viable option? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, what does the contract say, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And then eventually I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I start going on Amazon and I buy like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every cockroach related product I can find </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in terms of like, cockroach
traps, cockroach sprays, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even though I've had previous experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with cockroach sprays. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] No, spray never works. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I start reading-
- Sometimes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Some of the fuckers are
built like brick stone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - If Terraformers has taught us anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that shit don't work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes.
- They are invincible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so like I started doing research </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about Japanese cockroaches, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and if sprays actually work, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or if traps actually works, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because my experience with
cockroaches in Thailand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is that sprays don't work at fuckin' all, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it can actually make
the situation worse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They just like, scream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, they just-
(Connor screeching) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They just scream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] They go beserk mode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and so that was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I order everything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just try to forget
about the cockroach, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but like that night, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me and Sydney slept
with like one eye open. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like we couldn't sleep that night, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause we were just like, how can we sleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knowing that there is a
fucking cockroach downstairs? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What happens if I go to
the toilet, and I see it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, I just hear a
scuffling about, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] In the dark, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so in the dark. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, we finally go to sleep, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then first thing in the morning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I go downstairs to go to my office, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because my office is on the bottom floor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and my living room and dining
room is on the second floor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I go downstairs, and what do I see? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the fucker. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's right in the center
of my living room. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's got a lot of balls. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It has got a lot of balls. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right on the kitchen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I fuckin' freeze up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How do I get rid of this cockroach? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What do I do now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't have my spray. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't, like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm kind of scared that
it's just gonna run off, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe it's gonna fly, and
like hit me in the face again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like, maybe it's gonna
be a similar experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> to what had happened in Thailand. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm getting out the shoe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm getting out the shoe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm just like,
(Connor imitating whip) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's that spirit you've got. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like, looking around. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What do I do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do I try and kill it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do I chase it away? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What do I do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I'm trying to
ninja my way down, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And as soon as I try to do that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it sees me, and then it
starts running, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It starts running. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I look at it, and I realize, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wait a minute, it's
running so fuckin' slowly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because my experience was
with Thailand cockroach </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that they're like fuckin' Sonic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like fuckin'
speedy motherfucker's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This cockroach was running at full speed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was just running like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I like, I corner
it so it runs the other way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I'm still afraid that he can fly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I chase it towards the stairs, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I assume that it's just
gonna get to the stairs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and fly off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It goes to the edge of the stairs, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And this stupid motherfucker, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It tries to go on the side of the stairs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it just drops, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It just drops, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, wait a minute, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these fuckers can't fly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They can't fly, and they're slow as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then suddenly I'm like,
I'm starting to feel myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, all right, all right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe I got a chance here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe I don't need the cockroach spray. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can get rid of this by myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So eventually the cockroach, right now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is on the bottom floor,
so it's not even flying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It didn't even like fly down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It just walked, stumbled down, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, landed on his back, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, went downstairs, and
it kept going downstairs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I run down the stairs
and I go into my office, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I try to grab the
closest thing I could find </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to fuckin' slam this thing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so the closest thing
I could find in this rush </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> happened to be a mouse pad, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a booby mouse pad, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Garnt, what is that gonna do? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You literally could
have got anything else. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think your fist would have been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> more accurate.
- 'Cause I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't wanna, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't wanna stain myself, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So the closest-
- You're gonna stain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the booby mouse pad? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Weebs are crying right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was the fastest thing I could find </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in the rush.
- Fuck off, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> was this the fastest thing you could find. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you just have booby
mouse pads on your floor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I was looking for something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a shoe or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but everything in my office, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I can't grab- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Isn't your office right next
to where you keep your shoes? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So my shoes were in the cupboard, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What about the slam dunk shoes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I am not going to use
my fuckin' slam dunkers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Slam dunk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it was like most of the
things in my office are figures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or most of the things I see like figures, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like glass, or like solid shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So the only thing that I felt that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was the closest thing-
- Had elasticity? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, elasticity, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with this thing I could slam this thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> without having to worry about it braking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happened to be the booby mousepad, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's wrong with you guys? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Where was that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wasn't thinking, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's nothing else in your room? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is this the domestic
girlfriend one that you got? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, so this is me-
- A fuckin' signed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> piece of memorabilia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It wasn't signed, it wasn't signed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I have my signed piece of memorabilia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] It was the worst girl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so this was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I explained this, like I
thought about this consciously, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no, I just ran in my room just
like, grabbed this mouse pad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That was the closest thing,
and just ran back out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and by instincts, or
maybe not by instinct, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I grabbed like the booby
side of things, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I grabbed the tit side of things, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, this mousepad is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've felt a booby mousepad.
- It's flimsy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but it still has some weight to it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's not exactly like
I'm hitting it with paper, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it has a little bit of weight, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's like slapping someone like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'd love to see how you picked this up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're like, "Yes, this
is the weapon, my Lord." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> God sent like the fucking
gladiator stadium, like guns. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You may choose a weapon of your choice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Picks up a rock. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Picks up the booby mousepad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I'm ready." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look, I had picked it up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd committed to it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because I was scared that
I would run back out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the cockroach would be gone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but thankfully I ran back
out, it was still there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I fuckin' wham it once, okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're at full strength, slap
it, doesn't do anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, yeah.
- Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That makes it like an air cannon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I'm just like, wham
it once, didn't work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Wham it twice, didn't work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm just fuckin'... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt huffing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like fuckin' Quentin Tarantino scene. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Honestly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was like a scene from a
gangster movie or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> instead I don't have a hammer, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not bashing someone's head in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm bashing this fucking cockroach in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - With a booby. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - With a booby mousepad, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like this thing, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So I hit it, it falls
over, runs back again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> flips over, runs back again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're fucking you now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But after about five slams, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it starts slowing down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This thing was like fucking boss battle, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it had a fucking health bar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I could see his health
bar twitting down, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Sydney's like, "Garnt,
what's going on? Garnt?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't say anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I need to concentrate on kicking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A boss battle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All I hear is the boss battle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All I hear is the fucking
"Dark Souls" boss battle music. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I go for it for another three times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, crawling now, but I
still can't do the finishing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I still can't deal
the finishing blow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm just like, finally,
after it starts crawling, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I start using my head. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, wait a minute,
this isn't the heavy side. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought you meant literally like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's harder than a booby mouse pad? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, wait a minute,
this isn't the heavy side. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm like, all right, I'm
gonna do the finishing move. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I turn the mouse pad over
so it's booby side up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is where all the weight is, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I go for one more, fuckin' wham. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Direct hit, one-hit
kill, it is dead, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It is- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - He literally went from like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he went from dual blade to a broad sword. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't believe you're
framing this story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like some kind of victory. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's sounds like the most
pathetic thing I've ever heard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because when it's like,
when I saw it belly up, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I literally was panting, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the soft spot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt panting) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sydney runs down, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She's like panicking, 'cause
she thought I just fell down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the fuckin' stairs or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because all she heard
was like, wham, wham, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and me just heavy breathing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And all Sydney witnesses is just me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> standing over the dead
corpse of this cockroach </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a booby mousepad in hand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, in my mind, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Do you see what you get? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you see what you get if
you mess with the warrior?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like, that's how I felt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'd never felt so much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> adrenaline-
- What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Should hold up the mouse and be like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (speakers screaming) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just wanna know why
was the cockroach, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think I've ever heard
of a cockroach be that slow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe it ate too much lasagna.
- I've seen some. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> There are some slow cockroaches. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It ate the lasagna, probably. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was like, oh fuck, I'm so full, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just gonna stop.
- I'm gonna take my time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Nice walking.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But that means you probably have more. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Huh? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That means you probably have more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I mean, we already saw
one, and we've only seen- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Saw one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You only saw one, but you
know these sneaky motherfuckers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> probably created a colony. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We've got a load of traps
out just in case, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've been dealing with a pest of my own. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That sounds like I gonna
say like Garnt or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, true, but. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fucking pigeons keep
shitting on my balcony. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I put the grass down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They keep shitting on the grass. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you know how hard it
is to clean fake grass? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's so weird, 'cause
you've seen my balcony. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes, I have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was gonna ask, how do you
not get pigeons shitting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on your balcony?
- Never. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They come here, they chill there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll literally, I'll
clean it all up, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It'll take like 30 minutes
to clean all this shit up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> There's so much crap. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - The only place actually
that I get pigeons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the window in my office, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is on the edge of the building. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think, because there's
like, my balcony is inward, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> so it's like there's no wind or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I think it's like
nice and cozy for them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they always go for the corner top, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like they nestle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the corner.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they shit on this
thing relentlessly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I literally clean it, and
I'll come back the next day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and they'd be like 15 poops. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey giggling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's annoying', cause
it's like solidifies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You need to have something
to like, anti-pigeon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So now I've started having to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've gone through like
every method in the book. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I've got reflective shit
all over my balcony now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just everywhere.
- Hanging up CDs? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like stuff that
reflects, and so far, so far- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] It's working? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No poop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Oh, that's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I'm hoping that I
don't get any more poop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - God, just remembering that story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is just getting me ugly man, sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't realize how relentless
these pigeons could be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- And they're so noisy too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they are.
- I'll be sleeping. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I've got a PTSD, I'll hear the... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor trilling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, "Fuck, get
out of here you damn kids." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pulls out the shotgun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Half my life." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I get Garnt's M-16 from the figure rack, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so my, "Who wants some freedom?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey trilling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why didn't you use the
M-16 on the cockroach? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The M-16 is here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, should take it home, shouldn't you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - If we ever get a cockroach, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> we'll win. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Picks up cigarette. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pull out the big guns. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - With the cigarette in his mouth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - M-16 resting on his shoulder. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dare you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I dare you to come. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Take another bottle of zen, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> cockroach, I dare you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, no, because
after we killed it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> or after I killed it, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We? We? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's no we thing,
don't even go there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Our victory. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - After I killed it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> after I successfully slayed
this fuckin' demon, then- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Could probably hear fuckin' Lisa </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> playing in the background. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor singing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So after I slay this demon, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we got the brush out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We sweep it away, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I take it outside, lay it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Turns out the boss had a second phase. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It fucking gets up again, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I saw it scurry, and then-
- Second phase. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All the old classic play at the end, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> old classic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so weird, because
when we were sweeping in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no movement, fucking dead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Soon as it goes outside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a pro right there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Soon as it goes outside, turns
over, start scuttling away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So I had fuckin' hit
it again, hit it again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - With what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - With the broom, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> With the broom, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But if it's outside, then
just leave it, all right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's about sending a message. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] You did send a message, inside. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What if the kids are watching, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> outside?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's actually true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but then eventually I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fuck it, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna let this one go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll be like, "Tell your friends, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tell your friends what happens
if you enter this house," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Come again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I dare you.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Come again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And that was how Garnt
became a local hero. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The hot dog pizza has arrived. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do we know how much it
was, do you have a receipt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Crew Member] About 22 hundred. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck me man.
- 22 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God.
- For pizza this size? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look at this.
- It looks delicious, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, it's 50 off though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This was $20. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Thanks Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Thank you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What a joke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Look at that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like actual, like, sausages. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Dig in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dig in, y'all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What kind of pizza is it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just a normal Margherita,
or no, it looks at pepperoni. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, give me a slice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Go on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're not gonna tell me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that this is better than the stone-baked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, this is, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Look at the size.
- Well, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be fair-
- Oh, look how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> moist that cardboard is.
- I'm not a massive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> fan of Pizza Hut pizza in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, the Pizza Hut, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this one in Japan is weak, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not great, but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I am curious to see how this... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How the sausage is gonna fair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's pretty good, actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, pizza is pizza, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so it's gonna taste good no matter what. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just love that thick,
cheesy taste, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love thick bread. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like how we're just eating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Audio-only listeners, I apologize. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What point were we
trying to prove again? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - The hotdog. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, when you get to it, try it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then wrap it up a little bit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> get some sauce. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can I just eat it first? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like it's gonna taste less good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than the pizza side. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've gotta have some sauce
left, some cheese on it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (relaxing music) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Such a weird pause.
- It's a hot dog. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (relaxing music) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, I fuck with this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, isn't it good? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's weirdly good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I've had this before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It shouldn't be this good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, I normally get dip as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is this better than stuffed crust? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I think so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's better than stuffed crust. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I love that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't like the cheese
they use in stuffed crust. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's too thick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's way too thick.
- And it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like it tastes very similar, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so you just get a lot of
cheese, like way too much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, you have to have
the fresh stuffed crust. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because when starts-
- We'll finish this later. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When it starts off.
- Staff, please, try. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Give us your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> verdict.
- Staff, give it a go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Give us a go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - We need a second opinion on the show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - When it starts to harden a bit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's when stuff crust. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Crew Member] I don't like, what is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is it outside? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, normally, sometimes
it's inside, but I like it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it's good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I want Sydney's verdict, because American. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah Sydney, what's your
verdict as an American, Sydney? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Sydney] I'll try it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so do I eat the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why don't you just eat the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just eat it how you normally would, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then when you get to the crust, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just leave a little bit of the pizza, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and then just go from the side. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Garnt's like, "Leftover pizza? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Can you believe?"
- Oh, are we doing later? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I died. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll finish it later. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who just leaves a pizza? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not that hungry, I'll be honest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Wanted my American. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm not American, but Goddamn, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes I wish I was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe that's why I'm so angry
about them all the time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I just wanna be an American maybe. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I wish I was-
- He's angry at something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he can't be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just, I wish I could be American. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Crew Member] It's an
option, I mean, it's fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - With dip, it's way better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe.
- When you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some dip on it, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Crew Member] It's an option. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you put some ranch on that shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God, bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or garlic and herb, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> or something.
- It's not stone-baked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't put ranch on stone-baked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Sydney] No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You shouldn't put ranch
on stone-baked, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So then what's the verdict? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wouldn't dare. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Sydney] If I was drunk,
this would be like heaven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Sydney] But normally, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no, I'd rather cheese in the crust. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I suppose.
- I would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> prefer cheese in the crust as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like you get a pizza, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and then at the end you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh shit."
- You get like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a little meal at the end.
- A little hotdog. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- All right, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like, I like it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I never go to a restaurant
and look a waiter in the eye </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> can I have the option with
the hot dog in the crust? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But, if I can call up a
pizza place and tell them, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Hey, can you send it with the crust." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> For some reason, I feel like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I've figured out your taste, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> which is you need some variety in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't just have like, even
if something tastes amazing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you can't just have that same thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, I can eat
bread, like straight up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Except for bread, apparently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's like two
ends of the spectrum. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Either side the no variety, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> or too much variety.
- This is where half and half </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is amazing as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I love half and half. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Who doesn't want half and half? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't want half and half. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] I don't like half and half. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't like half and half.
- Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Why would you not want
two different flavors? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because why not just
order the superior flavor? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well maybe two flavors are amazing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I want to experience both. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - One flavor is always the best, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so I order that flavor,
and that's all I need, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because-
- I feel like this is weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because if you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> half and half-
- Do you never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get half and half? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Never. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Very rarely. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Never by choice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's always at a party, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because you need variety
at a party, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but I often find that
at halfway through a pizza, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> especially heavy one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I kind of need something
else to kind of mix it up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so that I'm not tasting
just the same, same, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> same, same, same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, for me-
- That's what dip is for. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, well dip, I mean, I love dip too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When I have pizza, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want like every dip on the table, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, dunk, dunk, dunk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, for me, if I have the same thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's an amazing same thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then I can just eat that endlessly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> until I'm full.
- That's true, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because pizza is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that style of pizza we
just had is quite heavy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, getting four or
five slices of that in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like, all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I need a gingersnap.
- You know what's not? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Stone-baked.
- Stone-baked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, which they aren't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Again, I'm not saying
that stone-baked is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> better.
- It's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Garnt was waiting for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Garnt's like "Now
is the time to strike." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what he does, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you fold up a stone-baked pizza </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into one little ball, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like one slice of a normal
American pizza, in depth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you fold up your pizza into a ball? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Yo, can we do that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Can we roll up a stone-baked
pizza into a ball, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just like, take a bite out of it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just like kind of wrap it around, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so it'll just turn into a dim sum. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Kind of like a dim sum. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like wove around. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, I'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> speechless.
- I think I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> actually got the Italian
mafia on me for saying that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just lost any rights
to would go to Italy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think we've all lost some
sort of ride to some sorts of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, yes you have. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yes, you have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have definitely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm pretty sure you just
declared war against Italy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm willing to give credit
where credit's due to Italy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Give credit where
credit is due to Italy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like they were the one
that kind of came in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and was like, "You guys have it good." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Italy's all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, a British man says. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hear me out, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (speakers chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hear me out.
- Hear me out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the Italian's have got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something.
- Coffee, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're doing that right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They got something right, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pasta? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They got that on lockdown. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No one can even pretend to
have any claim over pasta. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So like, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> For example, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> American pasta is like
a little bit different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the standard Italian pasta, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Italian pasta is fuckin'
drenched in, sorry, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> American is fuckin' heavy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so much sauce.
- It's like, oily. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, it's a lot of oil. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah okay, I don't fuck with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's just too much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There is a time and place. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like Imagiano's is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> every now and then I'll go there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I wanna feel like I
wanna destroy my stomach. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, like I understand how Olive Garden </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can do like bottomless stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, oh, they do bottomless
bread, don't they? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's bottomless breadsticks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is like, the breadsticks
aren't even that good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, I don't want bottomless
of something that's mid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Would you have an entire
meal of breadsticks? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It depends how good the breadsticks are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - If the breadsticks are good? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not Olive Garden breadsticks though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no.
- That's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like bread flavored cardboard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Sorry Olive Garden, but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just wondering- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When we ordered, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it was Napoleon-style pizza
from around, not too far away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's a few chains with of around Tokyo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It was really shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] It wasn't that great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was so bad.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I mean it's Japan, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't really know, though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but that was going for like stone-baked, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but not stone-baked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was a really weird
hybrid, do you remember that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It looked like a stone-baked, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but it didn't taste like it was actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stone-baked, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, it looks
stone-baked, but here's an oven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> A lot of pizzas I find don't
have a very discernible, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> cheesy taste, and I wanna
be able to taste the cheese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I find that like a lot of pizzas either, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because that's also when you put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> too much topping on the pizza. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like you can't taste anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you just taste meat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's too much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I need to taste all the flavors in unison. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So like, there needs to
be a right ratio of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> crust, sauce, and cheese,
and toppings as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, true, true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Otherwise I think there are
some pizzas I see where like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's basically just cheesy bread, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I know that's a type of pizza. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can get pizza
that's just cheese, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And you could also get margarita. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cheese pizza. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, which is just a sauce and cheese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't understand that.
- I don't fuck with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't fuck with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] I get that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess that's if you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> "I wanna have a pizza,
but I don't wanna feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> too bad about it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the people who get a pizza, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and then just scrape
the toppings off, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That hurts, that actually hurts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, what happened
to you in your childhood? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just get a pasta. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sydney does that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I die a bit inside every time I see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> her do that.
- Just dunk your bread </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in some pasta sauce. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey giggling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just bring like a fuckin' pasta, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like one of those sauce pots with you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, why ruin some pizza? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, don't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> This is not how I intended
the new year to start, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> by the way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't think I'd be- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I intended to start this way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not "Trash Taste" without
an argument about food. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, I don't know who had the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> clown opinion this episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - You.
- No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 90% of bread tastes the same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - All rice tastes the same? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bro, come on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Italian pizza in better
than America pizza? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone was a clown today,
ladies and gentlemen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone was a clown. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm glad we called this "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It shields us from a lot of criticism. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's just say that much, because we say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can say all you want
guys, but we're "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What did you expect? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like how we made the name </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in preparation of us
having shitty anime takes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> None of us intended to ever talk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> about food.
- Here's what I hate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about online, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone is so scared to give their </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> genuine opinions on stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, I'm talking like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not just like politics and
all that shit, whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't give a about fuck about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, unimportant stuff.
- Tell me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your weird food tastes that you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is really, honestly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's quite bizarre, but you'd die by it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everyone has these things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, everyone has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a weird-
- But is scared to tell them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because they were brought
up in a certain way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or they're not so familiar
with a certain type of cuisine, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> or, you know, sometimes taste
buds don't always make sense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You've got to have, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's no such thing
as objective taste buds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- One of my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> favorite dishes as a child, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is the most British
thing I'm about to say. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> My mum would just make
mashed potatoes and spam. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just mashed potato in the spam, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then just mash it all up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just give it to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's it, like the whole plate just that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - To be fair, it does sound
like it could be good, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but-
- Dude, it's really fucking- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think I could
eat that repeatedly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] I can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well yeah, of course you can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It sounds like something where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you didn't eat it as a kid, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you wouldn't like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you couldn't eat that-
- Maybe we should try it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, it's like me with natto. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Only reason I like is because
I had it since I was a baby. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can you convince kids to like any food? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I believe you can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How did they convince you to like natto, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but they can't convince kids
to like broccoli and stuff? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because of the people that
don't like broccoli are babies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - They are actually babies?
- They're actual babies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're actually babies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're actually... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How can babies like natto? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I liked it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe, hold on, do you know what it is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Big brain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Kids love slime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Kid fuckin' love slime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Think about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, yeah.
- Think about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every single YouTube channel
for kids, there's slime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, yeah.
- It's all slime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a conspiracy, bro,
I'm getting the red bull. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Bro, that's why kids in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's why they love
natto, 'cause it's slime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, baby food though.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Natto is baby
food with beans in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's slime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look, like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was always the slime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was always the slime.
- It was right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in front of us this whole time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Right under our nose. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like maybe, you know, broccoli or, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what were we talking about, broccoli? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, maybe broccoli
just doesn't taste good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as like, the main </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> part of the dish.
- No, in the case </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> with broccoli, isn't
it the fact that like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because kids' taste
buds are more receptive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to bitter flavors? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> As an adult, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then as you get older.
- Do you like broccoli? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I love broccoli.
- I love broccoli. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love broccoli.
- Do you like, like broccoli? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love broccoli.
- I love broccoli. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You give me like a plate of broccoli, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and I put some mayo on that
shit, and I can just eat it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, what? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing)
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuckin', fuckin'... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, you didn't know broccoli and mayo? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> That's a very Japanese thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't say it to be controversial. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought this was normal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You just said that like it was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bro, I just like grabbed
the poop out of the toilet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Just grab it, and I just eat it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] No, it's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Try it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Get some-
- I am down to try this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Get some steamed broccoli, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Get some Kewpie mayonnaise, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and then dip it.
- Wait, wait, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> wait, wait. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's very common in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, here's why I
recoiled for a moment there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had an image of you
with a bowl of broccoli, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just pouring a bunch of mayo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I've ordered from that
chicken and broccoli place, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's all over Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It literally gives you, and it's awful, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so bad, it's like non-seasoned, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> boiled chicken with boiled broccoli. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's all prepared,
so they just heat it up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and send it to you, and they
charge you like 30 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But one of the dips they give you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is low-calorie mayonnaise,
and I got to tell you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it goes hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Doesn't it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it actually does.
- It's actually good, like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just realized, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I loved that.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's amazing.
- You know what, actually? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Friendship again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, thank you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Thank you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sorry.
- World peace, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> world peace.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Attained once again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think Garnt's the weird one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, he definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Definitely.
- Have you had it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Huh? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We should have it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well no, he doesn't like condiments. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I will say though.
- Do you hate mayo though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay I will, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do you take his opinions seriously? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, no, I fuckin' hate Mayo, normally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, living in Japan, Kewpie mayo, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, Kewpie mayo fuckin' is amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know.
- Like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's 'cause I've just
had mayo my entire life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you put it on? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What do you mayo with? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sub, whenever it's in a sandwich, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Okay, next time you ever- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like I'm asking Mark Zuckerberg, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what is being happy? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I ate a sandwich. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Initiate happy process. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> No, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Next time you have chicken and broccoli, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just get some Kewpie mayo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and just, don't even
have to drench that shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like a little bit is enough, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the mayo is already powerful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You have a flavor, just a little bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, wait, wait, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you eat a fried chicken,
do you not like it with mayo? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, because I like the
taste of fried chicken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whoa. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Mayo's really good at like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of combating the oiliness of it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the heaviness of it, somehow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why a lot-
- And then like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> another oily, heavy liquid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It somehow kinda mitigates. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why I like with
(indistinct), for example. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You always dip in mayo, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just because I like the
taste of fried chicken. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] But with the mayo, it's fuckin'. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This guy knows. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There are some things
where I said, I just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if it's seasoned correctly,
then I enjoy that, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Because then I enjoy the
taste of the seasoning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rather than the taste of the condiment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can't expect like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like you have some
of the chicken on its own, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I also have of with the mayo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, just to try it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, dip it.
- Cleaning the palette, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> cleaning the palette. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I've said, if
something tastes fuckin' good, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I can eat that thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> infinitely.
- That's like what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> children do, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Children, like a dog, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like a dog, a dog can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I used to eat like, spaghetti bolonaise </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like five days a week. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sorry my taste buds
actually work, Connor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would argue they don't work, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because you are able to eat the same thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> over and over again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - If it's good, not if it's bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> If something tastes good, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then saying you can't eat it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> over and over again.
- I have food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I cannot eat everyday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't just go back to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So like, why do you think
it's so easy for me to be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I can easily eat the same meal every day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right now, I'm eating a
salad every day, and it's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's fuckin' easy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause salads taste great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Salad is inoffensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like saying, "Oh, I
can have water every day." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do have water every day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have water every day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not gonna lie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not really on board
with that argument. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna distance myself
from that argument. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just fuckin salad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't expect the most like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> grandiose combination of flavors, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> unless you like drench
that shit in dressing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I mean... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know.
- Other than that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like standard vegetables. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The thing is, I can eat some foods, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay, I found a salad place,
and I really liked it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I ordered that maybe 10 days in a row, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I want to say, I ate the salad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then now, for some
reason when I try and eat it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I know it's really good, but
I just don't like it anymore. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why is that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause you got bored of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- But isn't that sad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, that's why you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eat the same thing every fuckin' day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was so damn good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If it's something that I fucking love, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I purposely try not to eat it often. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I think the reason why I went- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because there's nothing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because there's nothing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because there's nothing
that terrifies me more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> than one day sitting in
front of my favorite meal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having a bite, and going, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Fuck, it doesn't taste as good as,"- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just, the reason why, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Here's why, okay? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> If it was a pizza, I
wouldn't do it every day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Pizza's are bad for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Salads good for you, so I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't mind if I do, round eight, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then yeah, I got bored of it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and now I regret it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because now I have a harder
time finding healthier food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I like eating, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I really fucked myself over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the real problem, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> when you can't have a salad anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, that one type of salad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] That one type of salad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like, my biggest issue is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have to force myself
to have a balanced diet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I can easily eat
the same thing every day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I really, really enjoy it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Lasagna. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I could fuck up lasagna.
- World-famous lasagna? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, okay, I can eat lasagna every day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I could eat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lasagna everyday.
- I could fuckin' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eat lasagna everyday. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Garfield, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Garfield.
- But that's how Garfield. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not gonna say it's
healthy or balanced, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but I can do it, and
I'm going to enjoy it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of course it's healthy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, of course.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If mom made it, of course it's healthy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Papa John's eats a pizza every day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He's still alive, somehow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's just the world's
most greasiest human beings. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my fucking God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, what a fucking awful episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is actually been
probably the worst episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of "Trash Taste" in terms of takes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hope you guys are ready for 2022, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it might honestly
just get worse from here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like I've got
concrete in my stomach. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what it was from
that have eaten today, but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] It's probably
the fuckin' pizza, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It couldn't have been that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that was the best thing I've eaten today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was the heaviest slice
of pizza I've had in a while. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] It was amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was good.
- I should go for another one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't believe, but that's
a problem in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It tastes good, but you've gotta pay $22 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for that entire ass pie.
- Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know, it sucks.
- It's so offensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Little Caesar's out here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> making moves.
- I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it might honestly be a blessing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because if it costs the
same as an American pizza, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yo I'd be like 500 pounds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the biggest deterrent, in terms, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what we should do, actually? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We should make- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - "Trash Taste" pizza. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We should make a food three
by three one of these days, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and pick the nine dishes that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're gonna defend the nine dishes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's going to be like,
the most toxic episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Four-hour "Trash Taste" episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's gonna be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the most toxic episode of "Trash Taste" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's ever been made. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] People skip through that episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We pick the nine dishes
that we couldn't live without. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what format is
really fucking horrible? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But just leads to people
tearing their throats out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The like, where you put
stuff in a tournament bracket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that shouldn't be in a tournament bracket. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Put like video games in
a tournament bracket, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the best one goes through. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was like, what
was voted the best game? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "GTA IV."
- "God of War" right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] "God of War" vs the best game- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The best game of all time.
- What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah, IGN's
bracket or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We should do that with food.
- Oh I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's fuckin' IGN.
- We should do a food bracket. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How long would that take? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A food tournament-off? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - We come down, and we have to agree, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what is the best food? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> No, I got it, I got it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Luckily we're three, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so we're countering.
- Oh yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've got it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> We're gonna make the food three by three, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're gonna present our favorite foods, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and then we are going to have the bracket </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the viewers to vote for, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then we're gonna present the winner, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or we're gonna present
the tournament results </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on a live stream or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> That's probably gonna-
- That ball game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're gonna tear each other's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> throats out.
- We have to put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> more food though, because it'd be like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- But we'll figure it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We'll figure it out.
- We'll figure it out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - But look forward to that, I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In the meantime, here are the patrons. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Look at them all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> They love you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If they're still here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wouldn't be surprised </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> if everyone was like, "Yo, this ain't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> worth my time."
- Shout out to the Italians </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> who clocked out an hour and a half ago. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're the real ones. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just wanna imagine what it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> being an audience member in this episode, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Yeah, he's saying
something that makes sense." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh no."
- I love it when we have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> people who are like,
food scientists watching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like actually, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Listen, I don't give a fuck." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Tastebuds go brrr, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They probably have to do for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, they're all having an aneurysm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in front of the screens </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right now.
- I do apologize </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> for any food experts out there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I might not be right, but
I'm anecdotally correct, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so that's what matters, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's why we were
in a political situation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that no one agrees. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- You know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> at least, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I may have some clown takes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but at least I'm friends
with some fellow clowns, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially this episode.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] This is the circus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey stuttering) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is not "Trash Taste,"
this is the circus now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] This is the circus, </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> every one of our cast members speak out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> against something we've
once individually said. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Before we wrap this up,
where the fuck is Grindlewald? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Where's Grindlewald? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why isn't he on the shelves, bro? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The best figure from
the whole purchasing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's in the corner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Somewhere.
- I didn't- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bring him out, bring him out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Give him here, give him right to Connor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's put them on the table. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There we go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Leave him right there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> There we go.
- Oh, heck yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought you were talking
about the Majora's mask. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, wait, does... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Does that not have a name? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is his name Grindlewald? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Joey, tell him to fuck off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Bye.
(speakers laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
