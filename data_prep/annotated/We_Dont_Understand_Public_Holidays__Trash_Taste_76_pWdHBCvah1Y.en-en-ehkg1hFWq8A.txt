<SPEAKER_03> (Joey humming)
- Oh, my God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the Thanksgiving
episode of "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - What are you thankful for? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Wii Sports memes, Bass Boosted. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm just saying, who needs new memes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> when Bass Boosted Monsters Inc exists? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey humming) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> - Hello, gamers and welcome.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sorry, I was deep in thought, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - To the weekend. (laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't wanna leave you hanging there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Technically, we upload
Trash Taste episodes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> on the weekend, so we can do that. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> - Yeah, so I can say ladies and gentlemen, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_11> the weekend.
- The weekend. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt yells then laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt clapping) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_11> - I'm your host for today, Garnt </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> and with me are the boys as per usual. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - As per usual. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And, if scheduling has gone correctly, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this episode should go up
on Thanksgiving weekend. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> If not, well fuck me, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> someone fucked up.
- Fuck, fuck. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Just pretend, just
pretend it's Thanksgiving. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> - Just pretend that we are thankful today. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, (laughing) only today though. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Only today.
- Fuck the other days. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - I'm British, I'll have
you know I'm never thankful, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> it's none important.
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - No, like every time I hear
about Thanksgiving right, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> because it is an American holiday </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> and because American culture
is so intertwined with.. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's a very polite way of putting it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah so,I mean, is it?
(all chuckling) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's in your face Garnt, all right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- It's in my face. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's inescapable. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_12> - You grow up, right. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> You watch the cartoons, you
can see that Ed, Edd and Eddy </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> are talking about this thing </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> that you don't know, you know why. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> You ask your mom why you celebrate it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she's like, "What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> Shut the fuck up." </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - But how I feel about Thanksgiving </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> is maybe how I feel a
lot of other countries </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> might feel about Christmas,
especially like Asian countries. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> You talk about Christmas, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> it's so like ingrained in our yearly cycle </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> that I'm just like, yeah Christmas time, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> it's holiday season. (mumbles) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Unlike whenever I go to Asian countries </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> and it's like, oh yeah that's the one day </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_11> that all the white
people celebrate, right? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.(laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just noticed your
shirt. What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing)
What the fuck, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's a great shirt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just had a glance, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's wrong with the shirt? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What in the name of Christ? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's some drip right there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I see what you're
thankful for this weekend, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this fucking day.
- Look at those under-titties. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - These are the thing that people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they get angry about the
holidays that don't exist, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've gotta understand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is prime real
estate for more days off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> More things to celebrate.
(Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't get angry about the
holidays, try and adopt them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wait, who the fuck is
getting angry about holidays? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - People.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like?
- People. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why?
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm saying, I want to have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Do you know what I don't understand? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - [Connor] Just kidding. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Japanese holidays.
What's up with that, right? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you mean you
don't understand C day? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_10> - Uh? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - What's not to understand about C day? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_07> - You don't understand Mountain day? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, you don't understand the holiday? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - What was the holiday we had this week? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Wait, this week we had
another holiday, right? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I have turned it on my Google calendar, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> the one that tells me
all the holiday names, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> because I always get a bit of a chuckle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> when I see what it's called. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Oh, it was Culture Day. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, Culture Day, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Here's the thing that
doesn't make sense, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Culture Day, national holiday, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone gets a day off on Culture Day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_10> It's a Wednesday. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> Who the fuck wants a
holiday on a Wednesday, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> in the middle of the... </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> I thought the rule, if it
came to public holidays, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> as a Brit, who we have bank holidays, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_11> it's always on a Monday, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> if it's not on a Monday,
it's gotta be on a Friday. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Like, Wednesday is the worst fucking day </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> you can put a public holiday. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, Culture day is always
the 3rd of November, though. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> So, it just so happens to
land on a Wednesday this year. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, checkmate Garnt. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> First of all the Queen's a bad-ass, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's why she knew
everyone wants Mondays off. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Approval ratings go through the roof. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> (Joey and Garnt laughs)
Everyone supports the queen. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Monarchy wasn't a mistake. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bank holiday's on a
Tuesday, I'm against monarchy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Bank holiday's on a Monday, I'm for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Bank holidays is just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> Why is it called a Bank
holiday, do you know? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I'm going to guess </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_12> it started of when the
banks took a holiday </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> (laughs) or something like that. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_08> - Okay, yeah you are
good at that, safe bet. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Am going to, we don't know. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> Ashley right now is making coffee, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> so we don't have a fact checker. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - "Ma'am queen, I work for the bank, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> " I would like a day off," </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and she's like, "Noted." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - But it's just like Bank holiday </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> is the British public holiday, right? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And it's always on different days </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> but it's like the first
Monday of a certain-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah 'cause we don't
have that in Australia. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - We get like a day off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if the Royal family gets
married or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on that day every year.
- Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you get like a
day off I think, for sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Do you? I don't know about that. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's been a while. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was self-employed so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - Since in the, working culture. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, I'm rise and grind
never stop, no Bank holidays. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, there's the
Queen's holiday, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Queen's.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - The Queen's birthday?
- No, the Queen's, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what's it called? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Her like was it Jubilee? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Jubilee.
- That's it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jubilee. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When she came into power. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's a public holiday for you? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For us, the Queen's
birthday is a public holiday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think it is as well. Why not both? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_10> - Wait, our Queen? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_02> - Our Queen is their Queen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Australia is part of the Commonwealth. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - I know, but like that-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro Australia is Britain light, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Upside down Britain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - That just fucking blows my mind </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> that they still celebrate
the Queens holiday </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> even though most... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Every Australian doesn't
give a fucking shit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about the Queen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - NO we don't celebrate it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_12> we just go, oh sick day off. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Australians are big brain. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Australians have figured out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_11> what other countries are
scared of, free days off, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> they know it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, what are like
American public holidays. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You asking me, I'm not American.(laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> (Connor chuckles) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Sorry Australia. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Australia?
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, we have Australia Day, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which is when our country was
founded, which is January-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - (Garnt laughing) Am sorry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - You're just laughing
British right there, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're like, imagine having a day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of celebrating your independence. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> That's so funny. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - We have, that's January 26. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Even Americans didn't have the balls </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> to call Independence Day,
America day, you know.(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - People call it America Day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - People America day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they didn't like
officially acknowledge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> it as America day. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - We call it fucking Australia Day, dude. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (Garnt and Joey laughing)
- I respect it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's the day when the
country goes nuts, my God. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's January 26th. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then we have Queens birthday, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> which is also a public holiday. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And then I think that's about
it really, other than like -- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Australia day. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, we have Australia
Day, Queen's Birthday </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> and then we obviously have Christmas Day, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Boxing Day, New Year's Eve. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> But most of the time for
us it's like we have, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's after Christmas day
until New Year's day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That week is like an entire
week off for a lot of places. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Normally for us too I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we have like a good
five days or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> over the Christmas period. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - First of all, thank God I
don't mind Wednesdays off, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll take any day off I'm not picky. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - I do, because this is like,
if I wanna have a day off, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I want it by the weekends. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I want all my days in a row. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I understand but sometimes having </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> that one day of relief is
worth more than the extra day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - If I know that I'm working
towards a long weekend, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> if I know I'm working
towards long weekend, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> that just makes the
week that much shorter. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's why Golden Week in Japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is like such a big brain, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, because it's
like having a week off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like you've just
killed your family in Japan. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know, it's just like unheard of. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "What do you
mean take a week off?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, cause Japan was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "What if we made a
bunch of public holidays </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "but just all in a row?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> It sounds like (gasps).
- Yeah, because </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> the problem with having
a holiday in Wednesday is </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> you can't really plan anything extravagant </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> around that holiday. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> You can't really go on a trip. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> A day trip does just doesn't feel as good </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> if you know you have to go back </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> to work the next fucking day. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> You know, they just like
the things you can do </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> on that public holiday are so limited, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> whereas if you have a long weekend, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> maybe like an extra day
of session with the boys, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> extra day camping-- </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah but I would argue
that at least in Japan, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> one whole day off is like, "Oh my God, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> "we got a whole day off! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> " Time to hit the town
boy, let's get crunk." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah like yeah, 'cause-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sorry, I wonder if the reason why, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just had a thought. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I wonder if the reason why people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> don't really leave Japan much </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is because they don't have time to. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - They don't.
- Yeah, they don't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a hundred percent
the reason why they don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The only time they will
is during Golden Week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where, they'll maybe go to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if have the disposable income, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they'll go to like Hawaii
or Guam or you know Okinawa. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just a waste to go to Europe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> if you're flying away
from Japan for one week. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> It's just not long enough. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - That's 'cause because
you waste like half a day </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> or two days just flying, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> So that's just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> why would any Japanese
person wanna do that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why do Japanese
people barely go to Europe, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause they just don't have the time to. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> - I guess that makes sense </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> why domestic tourism is massive here. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, because they can only go so far. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I remember someone told me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they managed to get two weeks off. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And they made it sound like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> they had literally killed
Goliath with their bare hands. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, they probably also
saved up their pay leave </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> for like thirty years. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, but it sounds like-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - This is like their retirement funds. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They are like putting this for holiday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> They're putting these
funds over the years. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - But the thing is, even if you
have two weeks off in Japan, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> it's very frowned upon to
take it in two weeks, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's just insane, it's like, bro, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> let the man just do what he wants to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, it's like you earned
a pay leave for like a week. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - But don't you dare
take it all on one go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't you dare take it all in one go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause otherwise , oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, you almost don't
wanna work for this company. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like, "No you gave it to me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> "so I'm gonna fucking use it," you know. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - With Japan, you have a
certain set amount of holidays </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> that, by law contractually every company </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has to contractually give the employees. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's like, from what I've seen most-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just suggestion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's a suggestion that you take them. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> You botch days off </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then you work on your days off, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sometimes a little people do. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You know what's funny though,
is that like Japan does have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> the most amount of public
holidays of any country. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they're just so scattered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like all over the place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, it's just so
scattered and it's so-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so unoptimized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like someone looked at the calendar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> and just like through a dart </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's just like, okay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's a holiday, that's a holiday. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - But what's most bizarre
is that, like Christmas </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> for example, is not a
public holiday in Japan. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, I mean Golden Week is like </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> the main big shark right. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, Golden Week is the
Christmas to everyone else. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's strange, 'cause
like Christmas in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feels like Valentines in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's weird 'cause it feels
like more of a date thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, I understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause they don't celebrate
Christmas that like same way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - But Christmas-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's weird how they've
managed to turn it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from like a gift-giving thing
into, "I wanna fuck think." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, "I'm gonna get some." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, Christmas in Japan is like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> if your spending time on
Christmas day with your family, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then your considered the loser. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - Imagine it, Imagine spending
time with your family, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it could be mean. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - But I think that happened </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because the family time for a lot </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_11> of Japanese families is New Year's. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - See, that's when shit is not open. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's when actual, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> the only time I've ever seen
anything closing in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, so the first three
days of the New Year in Japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> is a public holiday, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Most of the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> - Hospitals close too? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Hospitals close too. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> So you don't go too ham on New Year's Eve, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> otherwise, oh, you're not
gonna make it to the next year. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's so fun. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's fun.(laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - I didn't know that, I
didn't know that at all. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, but that's the
thing, right its what-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - What happens if you
get into an accident? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think--
- Rest in peace. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> - I think there are some
hospitals open, I think. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> But like a lot of them close. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would like to think so, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Its just like,(breaths heavily). </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I think that's why,
at least in the West right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the stereotype of New
Years Eve in the West is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you'd go out with your mates </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out into town or at a friend's place, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> and you just get hammered and fun shit, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> it's the last celebration of the day. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Biggest fallacy of the
whole fucking Western world. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - I get déjà vu, we
spoke on this last year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Have we, okey? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> We were like New Year's Eve sucks. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But in Japan, New Year's Eve </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> is actually a very quiet
time where you just spend it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe sitting in the
kotatsu with your family, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> eating some nabe, eating
some soba, whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Mochi?
- Yeah mochi, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know, a lot of like New
Year's foods will be there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Try not to get one
of the grandpa to die, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like fucking eating a mochi. (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it's like, granddad watch out, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the hospital is not opened.(laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bro, if mochi was
integrated in my culture, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> every time my grandparents
took a bite of mochi, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll be like, fucking time stops, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like, all right still chewing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, okay, now we'll get to the swallow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Zawa zawa </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_11> - and we're clear, okay. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Zawa zawa zawa. (Garnt and Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's technically kaiji
it's like zawa zawa zawa. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like Russian roulette out in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_11> - It's like old grandma
took a bite of mochi again, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> it's just like.(Garnt and Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey imitates a beating heart) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Get the ambulance on
speed dial just in case. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've got the numbers in dial already. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, but I think that's why maybe, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that might be a reason why they
took the liberty to be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> well, no one's getting
hurt in New Year's Eve </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because everyone's just chilling
with their family right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's having a quiet time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of self-reflection at
least in Japan right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> That would not fly
anywhere else in the world. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - The most accidents happen-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - In new years eve. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - During the Christmas, New Year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, daddy fucking cut his hand
off with the Turkey cutter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh shit! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Gotta reach hand shield, oooh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's it Christmas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, I feel like the UK one had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was the country that had all
the fucking weird holidays. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like what?
- [Garnt] What d'you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Back in the Victorian era, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure we had the fucking
weirdest ass holidays. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Maybe.
- We did, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Do you know much about this
or are you just guessing? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yo, what d'you mean, though? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_12> Have you heard about stuff
for the Victorian era? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> The shit is wild, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know the reason they used </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to paint their wall with like lead paint? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause they had like a green, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was a very popular type of green </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at one point in the Victorian era. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it turned out, to get this color, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you had to put a fuck ton of lead in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they were like,
"Why people just dying?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "why are people dying?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just like random shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they were like obsessed
with dead people and stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> like funerals, like parties and stuff. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> It's all really weird. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> If you go back to British
history, like a year ago, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> shit was fucking weird.
- [Garnt] Probably. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> - 100 years, 100 and like 50
years ago, fucking bizarre. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm sure we were weird. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, you don't even
have to go that far either, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we are like, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Remember the time when everyone was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I wanna keep my house warm. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> You ever heard of asbestos? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> Definitely safe, yeah put
that shit up in your roof, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> it won't kill you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Slightly different, but then
the Victorian was very weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we don't celebrate them,
but we have weird days. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> Like if you go and look through like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm sure if you go through
like the public history </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> of celebrated days in the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I bet you will find out
that Tom Wormbley Day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where we celebrate this man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who caught a big worm or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's British culture right there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, I mean like even stuff
we celebrate now is weird. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> The concept of Valentine's
Day is so fucking weird. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Ashley, can you Google what
public American holidays are? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Because like one thing that
confuses me, is I don't know, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> every time I hear about
America celebrating a holiday </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> or something, or like a special day, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know if it's an
actual American holiday. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Because Americans have
become like fucking experts </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> at celebrating other
people's holidays, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You mean like St. Patrick's Day. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_10> - Like fucking Patrick's
Day right. (laughs) </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> Which every American
celebrates, that I've seen, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_11> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> whoa, what is this got to do with America? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - Every American who is
like, I'm 1/16 Irish, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> it's like time for mine. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's my time baby. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's my time to shine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's my time, (cheers) here you go. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] Do you want
just Federal holidays? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like state holiday? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, federal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - Federal.
- Federal. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - So Thanksgiving is
obviously one and Christmas. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] You've got New Year's Day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Martin Luther King Jr. Day,
President's Day, Mother's Day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Memorial Day, Juneteenth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Juneteenth is a new one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Juneteenth?
- Juneteenth? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it was when the slaves in Texas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> were finally totally let to go free. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashley] And you've got
Father's Day, Independence Day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Labor Day, U.S. Indigenous
Peoples Day, Columbus Day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Veterans Day, Thanksgiving,
Day After Thanksgiving. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But a lot of these days,
people don't take days off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just like, a lot of these days, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> I've just never heard of before. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Like you don't take a day off </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's Mother's Day right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> (Connor and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Well that's what I mean
by like public holidays. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> A public holiday is a day that
you are not supposed to work. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> So I mean, like for example Halloween, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is that a public holiday
or is that just an event? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's an event. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it feels like
a holiday, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like more American celebrate Halloween </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_11> than I've seen some of these
days that I've heard of. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - For my mom, no, Halloween
getting spooky, okay, all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Did you guys celebrate
Halloween in the UK? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Which is why it was
like, so alien to me when-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> - Trick-or-treating and staff like that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_10> - Yeah, there are some people </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> who celebrate Halloween in the UK, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's certainly not as
massive as it is in America. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I remember when
I started dating Sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she was like ask me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, what are we doing for Halloween?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_10> And I was like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> I've never celebrated Halloween before. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - It's a horror movie? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_07> - I like watching a horror movie. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> And I was like, oh, we're
going to trick-or-treating, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we are dressing up. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I was like, dressing up
for Halloween in the UK </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> is going to Primark and buying
like five white T-shirts, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> chopping them up and calling
yourself like a zombie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> or a ghost or something like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - The costume game is weak. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's the extent of
dressing up in Halloween. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> If you spent more than one
day prepping your costume, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_10> you put in fucking effort. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> But in America, some
of these costumes blow </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> like anime cosplayers
out the fucking window. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_11> Like it's fucking insane. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> - For me, what blows my
mind more than the costumes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is how dedicated some Americans are </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> to like decorating their house. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - People there in the
UK sometimes do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - With like the lights
and like everything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Cause Aki, did it this year as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> She spent like three days around </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the house putting like
little pumpkin things around </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and putting up like a broom </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to look like it was part of a witch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, this is gonna
be gone in two days. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ( Garnt and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Why are you putting this
much effort into it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I get we are having like a house party </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Like I thought the cosplay
was more than enough. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> She's been playing fucking
spooky scary skeletons </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on the TV for three days straight. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, I'm about to
lose my goddamn mind. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't need all these like
pumpkin shit around the house. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you celebrate it in Australia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It depends, so some families do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but I feel that every now and then, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I did trick or treating once
in Australia when I was a kid. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But it was, I mean,
compared to like America </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> it was pretty pathetic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the one thing,
you're growing up as a kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I was like, why can't I do this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> That's when I felt like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> we live in a society
again, bringing it back. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I felt like I'd been robbed. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_11> - So pause, it's a week old
now, Connor get over it. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like we'd been robbed
a little bit, growing up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> 'cause I'm, every single year </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> you know I've throng the Cartoon Network, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> I watch "Ed, Edd and Eddy,"
they have a Halloween special. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I watched Cars Sick, I
know it's always Halloween. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I watched--
- Simpsons? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Simpsons' Halloween
special, Halloween special. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Always trick-or-treating,
always trick-or-treating. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember asking my mum,
"Can we go trick-or-treating?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she's like, oh you can try </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like, no one's
gonna give you anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No one's gonna have anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, oh how
are you gonna get a ride </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are you gonna walk? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The houses are kind of far
away from each other you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> I know I would go if we live
in a cul-de-sac or something, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> isn't that how it works? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you not live in these
new cul-de-sacs in the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> it was dangerous. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - What's cul-de-sacs? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like little area's, like a dead end </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> and big residential areas you've had that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kind of like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Brighton we had trick-or-treaters. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> I remember we went trick-or-treating. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh, really you did? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I remember went to
trick-or-treating once or twice, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> and kind of-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never been. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've never been?
- Never been. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, I thought
it was always overrated, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> which is why like as a kid, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I'm just like, I have to
talk to strangers that-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - I didn't even do it to collect candy, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I just throw eggs at people's houses. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fair enough, Joey is a mysterious kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't even like my
friend who was older than me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's a real bro moment right there. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> Talking about trick-or-treating
Joey is like-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Joey is like gonna
rob someone's house bro, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I was gonna rob them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - He was like, I just egg people. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - My friend who was older
than me at the time, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like two or three years
older than me he was like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> dude, we're not doing it for the candy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> We're doing it to fucking wreak
havoc in the neighborhood. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And he just handed me
like a packet of eggs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, what do you
want me to do with this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> And he's like, throw them,
throw them at the house. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> I didn't even like try and
get candy from the house. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_12> - Joey is just admitting to
destroying public property. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - The statute of limitations,
this guy has passed Garnt, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> he can't be arrested for this anymore. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> He's free to talk about his crime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - That was great, I guess though, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like my friend didn't tell me about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> why we would throw the eggs. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Because that was the
whole trick part right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you'd go up to a house-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was no choice in this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> there was no trick or
treat there was just trick. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - This is like Milgram's
experiment in action.(laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_10> "My mate told me, he told me." </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - So you go up to a house right, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> you do the whole trick-or-treating thing, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> sometimes you know, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_07> they'd be nice enough
to give you some candy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Then you were like, all right cool, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> let's go to the next house. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Now if they didn't you'd
get out there.(laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my fucking God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There were some people in this, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> no you have to understand. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> Because trick-or-treating was
just not a thing in Australia, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some people just wouldn't
have it like at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> They were like, I don't
want these fucking kids </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> coming up to my doorstep
asking for candy right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So some people were really
fucking rude about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> They'd just opened the door. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> The moment they would see
some kids dressing up, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> they just fucking slammed the door. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that was the time
when the eggs came loose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (They all laugh) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So what you would do-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I kinda hated that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So what you would do is
you'd fucking, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if they fucking rudely shut the door, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you'd run back onto the street </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and just chuck a couple
of eggs at their door. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - How many eggs did you bring with you? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - So my friend had like
three dozens of eggs right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> So like it was enough for
maybe you know a street or two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the problem was when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> my friend told me about this revelation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He didn't tell me when to
throw the eggs exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So what I ended up doing was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I would just stand in
the middle of the street </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and just fire eggs every house I saw. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did anyone chase you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Without even going up to the door. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're an idiot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I didn't have any candy with me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, oh see I can throw these. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - How old were you? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I was maybe 12. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So I just let loose
about like a dozen eggs, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but for my friend, it was
like, "What are you doing?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> You have to ask, you have
to try for the candy first. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_11> - You just fucking drive by
the fucking neighborhood. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_12> - Did nobody come out
and fucking slap you? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, I'd just run
away before that happened. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Just like a Monty
Python skill or something. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> (Connor and Joey chuckle) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> You're like, "Bro, you
wanna go trick-or-treating?" </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> "Sure." And you're like
the one weird kid.(laughs) </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_11> - "Here's some eggs."
(Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Your mom asked you
to go trick or treating </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> with the neighbor's kid,
the neighbor's kids. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Yeah, it's like, yo.(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - I got some eggs. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I think half of the illusion </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that was so enticing
about watching it on TV, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> about trick-or-treating, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that American candy just looked cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> British candy and British
sweets just looked like boring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - That's why I never like enjoyed it </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> 'cause it was just like,
well, whoa, oh my game. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Just like the most basic
British sweets anyway. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - We have some awesome candy in Australia. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - We have like a dairy milk
and then America would be like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we have the toxic apple
bottom or something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, whoa, what's
that? That's awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, but then you'd
hear about the elusive, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what is it? What's the
fucking corn-shaped, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> corn-flavored fucking things? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> Candy corns.
- [Garnt] Candy corns. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, right.
- What's that? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - You've definitely seen it, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> 'cause you see it in
cartoons all the time. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> It's the one candy </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> that all the kids like,
"Eew, candy corn (mumbles)." </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like a white and
orange corn-shaped thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And apparently it tastes like garbage. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've never tried, Americans
can probably vouch that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> every American I've talked
to about candy corns, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't think I've met a single person </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that said that they liked it.

<SPEAKER_11> - I can't believe </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> you just fucking egged your
entire neighborhood, Joey. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, there's a reason
why I only did once. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey was the little rascal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - He did it once, Joey's one
trick-or-treating experience. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, he sent them a message bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He doesn't need to come back,
he made it really clear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - I don't need the fucking
candy, I just wanna wreck havoc. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - No, because it's people
like you why, my see, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> during Halloween, when I was growing up </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> we went through an egging
epidemic.(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> Like literally in our local supermarkets </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> and Tescos and everything. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_11> We literally had to stop selling
eggs during Halloween right </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> 'cause too many fucking kids
would start egging houses. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_02> - They did that in Swanzey as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was from the university
students not the kids. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughing) Though you needed to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> during Halloween you need
to buy ID for three things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> cigarettes, alcohol and eggs.
- And eggs. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hide your eggs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Here they come. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - You didn't ever like TP
a house, Joey? That's the-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, with the toilet rolls? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - That seems like the
more annoying ass one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I saw people on
my street doing that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> "You guys do the TP,
I'll cover it with eggs." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll make the toilet paper extra sticky. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like tar and feather. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_12> You put the sticky substance on </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_03> then put the thing to apply it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - We're just revealing </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> that Joey is a domestic
terrorist right now. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, Joey's criminal, man,
Joey's a harder earned criminal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> - I only did it once. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I was socially pressured, dude. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> - When Joey goes back to Australia, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> they'll arrest him at the
border. They're gonna. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> "We finally got him." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I only trash egg some houses. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your decades-long
case can be put to rest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, because like it
must be a similar experience </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> to what England went through as well. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> 'Cause Halloween to me wasn't a holiday, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> it was like a half a holiday. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> It was something that
we acknowledged existed, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> but no one did anything for Halloween. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_11> And I would be interested, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> have you spent Halloween in
America or anything before? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want to, I really want to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_10> - I want to, I saw fun over there. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - I think I have. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've experienced three,
4th of July's in America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, yeah, I mean
it happens every year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - I don't really count 4th of July, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause every 4th of July for
me is like hung over as fuck </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because it's always the last day of AIX. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> So I'm just like, oh freedom, fuckin'. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - The scariest 4th of July,
experience I had though, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> was in LA and one of my friends who lives </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> in LA took me to this coffee shop </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_09> that one of his friends
owns in downtown LA. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Mind you, fireworks are
going off all fucking day, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like you wake up to that
shit on the 4th of July. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And he was like, yeah, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> we should go get some
coffee at downtown LA. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the first time I've ever
been to proper downtown LA, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like very scary. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> So I'm there, just drinking coffee </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> in front of my mates coffee shop. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And you know, people
are doing fireworks out </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> on the street, whatever. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And I'll never forget it. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> The owner of the coffee shop
like comes right up to me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> He's like, "You know
that if it doesn't echo, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's a gunshot, right?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt and Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "Great coffee, I'm gonna go." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - He gave you a fair pice of advice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - I don't feel safe in
this city right now. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Is that how he started the conversation? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - He started the conversation. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I was like, I wasn't gonna warm
it up, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> Like, "How are you, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> "how did you come to run this coffee shop? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> "Who are all these people in front, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> "are they all your mates?" </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> No, he literally gave me like
a you-might-get-shot warning </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right from the get-go. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Speaking of shots, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the best holiday </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the fact that we have Guy Fawkes Day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a fucking awesome holiday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that a holiday? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a holiday.
- Is that a proper holiday? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm pretty sure it's a holiday. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - I don't think it is a holiday. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> It's just a day of rememberance </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a holiday in my heart, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking the British population-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's an holiday worth
celebrating.(laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm thinking the British
population's is heart, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> it's a holiday.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - The fact that we fucking celebrate </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> some dude tryna blow up our
parliament, that's amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is pretty cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_11> - So if you haven't heard of Guy Fawkes, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> he was a guy who tried to blow up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the British parliament and failed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_10> And we celebrate that </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> by lighting a shit ton of
fireworks in celebration. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_02> - V for vendetta, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, yeah actually V for vendetta. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_09> - Name one other country </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that celebrates a terrorist
act happened on itself. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> like this man was finally gonna blow up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> one of the most important buildings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we're like, dude that's it! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And we're like, yeah!(laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_12> - Bro, lets celebrate that men. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_07> - Wait, d'you guys all
wear the Guy Fawkes mask. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, that's thing that
happened from the fucking movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> And fucking Warner Brothers
gets a cut of every mask sold. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> Did you know that?
- Oh really? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Yeah, they have the rights to that mask. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> No one wears that mask, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> and everyone just goes to the supermarket, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> buys as much fireworks as they can, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you all just judge your friends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I can't believe anonymous </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is supporting a corporation like that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't that what's ironic, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> is that when you buy these masks, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> you're fucking supporting Warner Brothers? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> That weird.
- So funny. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wonder if they have a
thought about, by the way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It's going against
everything we stand for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Warner Brothers' like,
"Yeah bro, keep going." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Guy Fawkes mask, that wasn't
a thing when we were a kid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was no Guy Fawkes masks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - No, there was no Guy Fawkes mask. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> It literally started
off the V for Vendetta. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - That wasn't a thing. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - So wait, he didn't
actually wear that mask? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - No.
- No, that was a mask </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> that was modeled after him,
basically, like a caricature. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - He had a sick face. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - I've been lied to, I thought
he actually wore that mask. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - (Garnt laughs) What? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause my only like exposure </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> to Guy Fawkes is V for Vendetta. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Google Guy Fawkes, man, IRL
photo, IRL Tinder profiles, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> some shit, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Bro I just love the fact
that we celebrate that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't understand how that came about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Who decided that was
gonna be like a thing? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't understand how that came about. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Guy Fawkes real face. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - To be fair, if any country </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> would celebrate the downfall
of its own government, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other than French people,
it's British people, for sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Now, if that isn't drip,
I don't know what it is? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh man.
- That's the thing, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - That is fucking drip, look at that. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_12> - When that guy walks into your house </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> with a barrel full of explosives, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> you're almost like, go ahead, man, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_06> look at this man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Roll out the red carpet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_12> - Oh, I'll help you. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> Where are we putting it, bro? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> You want to light it? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_05> He looks so fuckin' clean, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is a clean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, I can see where the mask
comes from then, for sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> Oh, okay I did not know
that, there you go. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - What about Easter, do
you guys celebrate Easter? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you have anything for Easter? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I just eat chocolate,
just eat chocolate isn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, so I did
actually,like our family did, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so it would just be like a
family gathering, though, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where we get a bunch of
our cousins and what not. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - We didn't celebrate it all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But like, it changed
from when I was a kid </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to when I was an adult. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So when I was a kid, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> every Easter I would go
to my grandma's house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she would hide a bunch
of Easter egg chocolates, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all over the house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So me and my sister would look for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But now as an adult, I do that
for my younger cousins now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Aww that's cute. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it's like a cycle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're not like religious
or anything about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> it's just like, oh, cool. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Just get in a circle, eat
a bunch of fucking eggs. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Eat a bunch of chocolate
block your arteries </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and have a good time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - What about Thai holidays? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Is there anything in Thai holidays? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - There is. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't lived in Thailand for a while, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so, I mean, obviously
like the King's birthday </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going to not say anything
in case I say something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in case I say something erroneous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know there's, I need to
talk about Thai New Year's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> our Thai New Year's. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> So Thai New Year's fucking slaps. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_11> So Thai New Year's is like fucking April, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> it's called Songkran. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And basically it's--
- It's called what? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Songkran.
- You said that like so fast. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - (laughing) Sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - And basically, it is Thai New Year's, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> it's when like the Thai
calendar flips over </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> and during our New Year's, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> it's the hottest time of the year right. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> So it's fuckin'-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I think you run that figuratively there. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the hottest time of the year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_10> - It's the hottest time of the year. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_08> - Everybody's got their drip out.(laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's figuratively as well, all right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, instead he meant
we are literally on fire. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The country is literally on fire </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's deep in like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_11> - Figuratively and metaphors. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is like a book, it's
the hottest time of year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_11> - No, so that's how we celebrate right? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> Is the entire country has
a massive water-fight. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_05> It's fucking insane, it's fuckin' great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember the first time
we're in Thai New Year's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when Sydney was there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She was like, "What's going on?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, "Oh shit it's Songkran." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> So what we do is you go on a street, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> you buy the nearest fuckin' water gun, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> and you just start shooting strangers </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> and they shoot you back. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - That's awesome.
- You get shot. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> (Connor and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_12> - [Garnt] Sorry. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - You were like, and you shot. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_10> - [Garnt] Basically, you just-- </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - I've seen me with everyday,
your squad gun.(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - Water camp.(Connor and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you just start firing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> And it's the only socially
acceptable time in the world </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where you go out on the street </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and you better be prepared to get wet. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Because like you can-- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So on the Spring break.(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - That actually sounds so fucking fun. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - It does sound fun. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> - So they're like, I mean, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> also it is like pretty dangerous as well. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_00> We can't get rid of danger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause there are people
even on fucking motorcycles, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you see people on motorcycles
and the driver is driving. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_11> And I have a passenger
who's doing a drive fire </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> on people on the street. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> And I'm just like, this
could go very badly. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> - [Joey] It's like Thai
GTA.(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I remember one fun
childhood memory is like, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> so during Thai New Year's,
I went to visit my family. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And so we start having water
fights in our house right. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> And so then we were
having a fun water flight </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then my big cousin
rocks up in a trailer truck. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And he goes, "Get in boys, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we're gonna start shooting
some people."(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so we just all jumped in this truck </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and drive around the village,
just start spraying people. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, dude that is just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as a kid, childhood peaks there, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> - I have two questions. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_11> One, can you bring in like insane gear </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> like the Nerf collection, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> like the Super Soaker XL
gatling gun addition of water? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can you--
- Oh yeah that's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - People go that armed? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some people are prepared,
some people don't even that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> some people just bring out fucking hose. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - The pressure washer
they are like be gone. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Just fucking tearing off
people's skin with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> (Garnt laughs and Joey screams) </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> And number two, what is the
significance of this day? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> I understand that we squatting
each other, what's going on? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> What's the point? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - It's a Thai New Year, and I don't know-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why are we squatting each other? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - I don't, I just assume </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> it's cause it's the
hottest time of the year. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_12> I don't actually know
the history behind it, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> but I assume it's because
it's the hottest time of year. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Just get a year to sick
water fight, who is complaning? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_09> - Just cool off the people. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - The entire country just
wants to cool the fuck down </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> for like a little bit, before
they go back to burning. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Man, I wish I had
something like that in Wales. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We just have we have like
one day that I know of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> which is like that the wild ski. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - We have that in Australia. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's called New Year's Eve. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah okey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause hot as shit New Year's Eve. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The only Welsh holiday I
know that I can remember, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is just like the 1st of
March, is, DYDD Gwyl Dewi, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just saying St. David's Day. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you do for that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't, chill out, eat leek. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - What are you Hatsune Miku? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_12> - But we legit. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Eat leak. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_00> - We eat leak.
- Yea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember right. So here's what we do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Here's the POV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> POV you're at the, the
sickest event of the year. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you've got your little badge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a leek or a daffodil,
it's one of the two, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you attach it to your little
thing, and you wear red. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why you
wear red, and then you-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then you eat some leek.
- Leek soup. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Leek soup, anybody? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_12> - [Garnt] Sounds like banging event. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - I don't know what else we did. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_08> We used to like hike. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I already now understand the significance. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hike Day? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Now that I got a little older, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I understand it's an
excuse to get a bit drunk, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_11> which is good. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - As you get older, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> that's just the excuse
in every public holiday. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- I wish I remembered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what this Saint did, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> Do Saints have to do anything? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Is it something to do with leeks? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Do they have to do anything? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> I don't know. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Can you just become a Saint? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Did he discover the leek? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Perhaps he figured out </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> some bomb ass recipes with
the leek, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - What if we turn this into a soup? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hold the phone, I don't know actually, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't really know why we celebrate it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - That's me and like most
holidays, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> A lot of holidays, I'm like, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why were you doing it but-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] That's most holidays here though. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - People are getting drunk. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - That most holidays here. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, what the fuck
do I do on Ocean Day? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> No, one's at the ocean,
'cause it's cold as shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - (laughing) Why is it
called Ocean Day?(laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I don't know. We have
another one called Showa Day. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Showa is the.... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The doors? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_12> - No, no, no, it's shoji. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - I was like, we celebrating doors? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> - Showa is like, you know
how we're in Dewa right now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, Showa is the two before it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's like, why do we
still celebrate Showa Day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when it's not Showa anymore? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro that's one thing
that, yo, I hate man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that when you fill out your year, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you fill out your date of
birth someone in Japan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they wanna know that you
era you were born in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Not the year you were born, the era. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like-
- Do you remember your era? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor mumbles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Heisei. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Heisei that's the era. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - What year though?(laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - The one that looks like Kuru. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know.(chuckles) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm Heisei six. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Eight, I think I am. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think so. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - You guys are speaking
a different language. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I have no fucking clue. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - You probably like Heisei two. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - What year where you born? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - 1990. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_12> - That's stupid though,
- 1990, yeah Heisei two. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - You gotta circle the fucking
calender you were born, why? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_11> - It sounds like astrology
with extra steps. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_12> - It's like having silhouette. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_10> - I'm Heisei Sagittarius,
Gemini VI, what are you? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - Heiseis and Reiwas was don't get along. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_12> - It's every time they
have a new emperor, right? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Yes. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it's like if you go to date of birth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> and it's like, circle the queen or king, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> the reining monarchs, circle
the picture of the outline. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - You wouldn't have a problem with that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause you have same
Queen for about 80 years. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because everyone would
have Elizabeth bro, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But what is confusing,
I'm like, ah, which one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's just like, I don't get it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause some government don't
do it, some governments do it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> can you all just decide, why
can't we use the numerics? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's easy, everyone likes new numerics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - What I do understand is how universally? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> So we have the date, right?
I believe it's on the Bible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We have the day, the month and the year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - [Connor] I know what you are saying. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Now, what order does that go in? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_11> - Listen, okay. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - It depends on the country. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - What do you do in Australia? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Day, month, no month, day, year. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh you do American style? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - No day, month, year.
Wait, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even know anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Wait, how do we do it here? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_11> - Japan does, year, month, day. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Japan does, year, month, day. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> Which I think actually
makes the most sense, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- I disagree. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Why? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Because, where are you right now? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_12> You're in the day, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> and then you're in the month,
and then you're in the year. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_11> - Okay, you try.. (laughs) okay. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> You know how Japan loves documents. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah?
- Now, try sorting documents </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> out in your mind, how
would you sort them by? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - By day. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> - You start with the year first. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - You go by the year first, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And that's how I know Japan
chose to put the year first, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 'cause if put it into a like... </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Sorting documents in the computer, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_10> you start off the file name with the year, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> it's source out perfectly, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> you started off the
file name with the day, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> it's a fucking-- </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_11> - You never get a harder time </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> where you getting here at the
fucking bureaucratic office </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> would be like, Tanaka,
"Give me all the documents </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> "that were signed on the 11th, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> "of any month in every year, just the 11." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like your... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know how Americans do address, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but you do your address, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You do your street first and your number </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the part them when you
get bigger and bigger right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you ascend and the scale right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Was certainly in
Australia, I think, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You do your address of your house, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the number of the street, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you do the county or whatever, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> then other town, county, postal code. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Japan is like the other
way round, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, it's the other way round. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> - You start with the
prefecture, and then the city, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then the area of the prefecture, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> and then the block of the street. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, and it's--
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> I think that makes more sense though, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause you're narrowing it down </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> as you're searching
for this address right. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but the way I see it is that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're in a postal
system, you're gonna like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first thing I'm gonna
read is the first line, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I think like if you look at something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you're always gonna
look at the first line. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If I'ma man who's delivering letters, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna be walking in Hokkaido anywhere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't even know that
I'm walking in Hokkaido, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these letters are all Hokkaido. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> I'm just gonna look at the
number, all right, here you go. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - On the flip side, though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> but I think we can both
agree is, why Americans? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_11> Why'd you put the month first? Why? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_12> - That is weird? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is the meaning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like "Trash Taste" we get
confused of everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> The one thing we agree
on, shitting on Americans. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> I love America, what's
going on with America? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_10> - That is weird. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_11> - In what logical sense
does that make sense? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Why would you put the month
first over the day or the year? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> 'Cause it always fucks
me up when I buy a new PC </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> and it tells me like, if I set the date </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and there's always the month first, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what if it's the 11th of
the 11th right? (laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Sometimes I'm literally confused
as to what the format is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> because like the day isn't
large enough to dictate </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> if it's a month or a day. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - And at the same time they do that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and yet they call it 4th
of July, not July 4th. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> So I'm like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_11> - I never thought about that. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> - So I'm like, why would
you not call it July 4th? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think some people call it
July 4th but I think most-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've never heard of July 4th. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Everyone's called it 4th of July. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe 4th of July.*
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - July 4th sounds like, ah feels dirty. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just feels wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But doesn't seem to be any-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not even American
and I don't like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Maybe there's some reason why </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_04> but just from a normal zero
understanding of background, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it does seem to make no sense </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> for the month first, then the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you not even doing in some order, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> you're just like shuffling it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Putting the year second, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> that feels like something
America would do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, day, year, month. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - The 11th of 1994, October. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_12> - May as well, we've already
chose anarchy, why stop now? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know there's a reason why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - There's probably a reason why, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> I'm just too dumb to understand why. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - We just wanted to be different. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like there's a
lot of things with America, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> like the imperial versus
metric system you know, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> it's just, there are just some things </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> where America just decided, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> this is the way we're gonna do things. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay but you have to
admit, I think the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> I don't know about Australia
but I think UK is the worst. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Oh no, UK is fucking awful as well. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - 'Cause we mix. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> It's like, what are you doing? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> The absolute state of this country. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, in Australia, it's all metric. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Actually, the only time in Australia </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where we would ever
use the imperial system </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> is when we're talking about
basketball player height. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Every time I shit on the
American imperial system, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> they're like, "What's miles per hour?" </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And I'm like, "I would like
to retract my statements, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> "my country is just as stupid." </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - I refuse to use the imperial
system, I will not use it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I will go out of my way to avoid using it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it's so inconsistent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - I think that the more
you just kinda like, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I don't know, I wanna be all right, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I'm not gonna change this,
I'm one man, I can't change </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> but I'm like, if I have my way, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_12> and all the people adopt it too, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> maybe things will change eventually. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> I left the country, so maybe not. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> But to me, it's like-- </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - But I like the metric system </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like it works
in increments of 10s right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like 10, 100, 1000, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meanwhile, in America, it's
like, three inches to the yard, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_12> God knows how many no, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> three inches to the foot, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> I think it's like 16 feet to the yard. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - 4 teddy winkles in a meter. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_07> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> This land looks like it's
about penguin flops large, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yes four penguin flops
large, it seems to be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The UK is the way, here's why right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause in America, at least
they've decided the pounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is a system they're gonna
use to measure weight right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In the UK we decided, no, no,
no, we need pounds and stones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, this is
the dumbest shit ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's the reason why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I hate watching like weight
loss TV shows in the UK </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause they just hit me
with these fucking metrics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I can't understand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_12> They're like, "Tim was
12 stone, 18 pounds." </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> No that doesn't make sense. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> "Tim was 12 stones and 12
pounds, he's now down to 11." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> So what does that mean? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't Know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, how many pounds to a stone? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Ashley] 16. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it's like 14 I
think is it? Are you sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - All I know is losing a stone of weight </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> is an impressive feat,
that's just what I know. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hey Siri, how many pounds to a stone? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it 16? I swear it's not 16. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Phone Female Voice] One stone is 14. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I told you 14, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_12> Fact checker, got fact
checked, straight up. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Checkmate. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Yeah, I remember. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_07> - We're firing Ashley and we hiring Siri. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hiring me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Okay, here's the question then. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> How much is a pound? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> Because in my head it
makes no fucking sense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause for us it's kilograms and grams. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - The only time I ever
get a frame of reference </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is when I go to the gym </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and both the machines have
the kilogram and the pounds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, oh, just a
little bit of studying, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> tryna figure it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause every time like an
American comes out to me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he's like, oh man, I'm
so fat, I'm 130 pounds, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not fat, that's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_11> - It seems a lot to me. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - You're just spouting
out numbers, to me right. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, 130 seems a lot in my world. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's weird as well,
'cause I'm under six foot, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna abolish the whole six foot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's go to centimeters,
that sounds cute right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's go to that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, I never used feet for inches </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> until I started dating Aki. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I told her, I'm like,
"How tall are you, Aki?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> And she was like, oh, I'm five foot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, that means nothing to me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - I didn't start using feet </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> until everyone on the
Internet start using feet. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know, yeah why do
people on the Internet use feet? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's just something that universally, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> no one says they're height in
centimeters on the Internet, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> even though a lot of the
world still use centimeters </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> to measure themselves. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's because every time you do, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's gonna be at least
one American in the reply, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> being like, "Eem, can you use
the Imperial system please?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_11> - I literally did not know
how tall I was in feet until </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I went on the Internet. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, this
is part of the Internet, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's learning your height
in foot, apparently. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then like, okay
so when you cook right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> if you get a cooking book
from 40 years ago in the UK, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it'll all be in ounces. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you get a cookbook now in the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it'll be in grams and liters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Weird. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not an issue
because none of us cook. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey, Garnt and Ashley laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_12> - What I'm saying is, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_11> I agree but what I'm saying is </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> the consistency is fucking annoying. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_09> Like nobody said-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> - When have you ever used
the cookbook, Connor? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> - Well I tried to cook, it didn't work out </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I couldn't follow the book. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause I didn't know what an ounce was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you have like a, what's it called? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't even what it's called </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a measuring, weigh thing! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah I too. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a kitchen scale? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, that's what I was talking about. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt tries to prove
he's not a drug dealer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you have a scale?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> - Fuck off.
- I have kitchen scales. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - You have the kitchen scales
'cause Aki's cook, though. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - It seems interesting to have, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, sometimes it becomes useful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you ever used it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, not for cooking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Not to pack my drugs. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Sometimes there's things </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that like, I wanna measure something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is not heavy enough
to put on my actual scales. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like what? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I don't know, just like
maybe it's, I don't know. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Salt and powder. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> ♪ Tn, tn, tn, tn, tn ♪ </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - What are you measuring? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - There's been things, I
can't remember what there. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Salt. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey, Garnt and Ashle laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so it's really annoying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that it's inconsistent with
the that we change randomly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Nobody nobody's said that we had to change </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the grams and liters for
cooking, we just did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But then we didn't change miles </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> because all the signs are in miles, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that's not gonna change. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I've always wondered </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> why do you guys still
measure 80 miles per hour? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - No idea, because you know-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Do you measure distance in miles? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - We do actually.
- [Garnt] Yeah we do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it's really confusing
'cause I remember that we... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really strange 'cause we're in the EU </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we were for a long time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> but then maybe we refuse to do anything. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And if you go to any of these countries, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's all in kilometers,
sometimes, some countries. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's a mess, it's such a mess. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> And although if you learn
science or anything in the UK, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> you learn the SI units, which is all. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Which I obviously you learnt. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Kelvin and-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Oh meters. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> Everything goes nicely into-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, but that's the
same in America as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> They teach you-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Not always, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sometimes they do.
- Really? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I don't know if they still-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You mean the science. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know if they still
do it, but some places do. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> Because when I was in university as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was doing engineering. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Some of the older papers they
gave me, did you have this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well some of them would, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> can you figure it out in
pounds per inch like force? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yes.
- Pounds per square inch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> - And that was all the
questions. And I was just like. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_11> - And I'm like, this formula
is complicated enough as it is, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> and you want me to convert
that into pounds to inches? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> Fuck that shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Every time I heard
pounds per square inch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> in MythBusters episodes, I was
like I'm just gonna give up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm gonna assume it's a lot. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't know if they do in America, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I totally I don't... what, your hand up? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Your hand is up, can you check </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if they still teach it
in American universities? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] I just know
there's a famous case where-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the NASA, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Oh, yeah, the Hubble
Space Telescope, right? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh no, it was a Mars mission, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a mass mission, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a fucking billion-dollar
mission or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it got fucked up and burned
up in the Mars atmosphere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because the teams designing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> couldn't agree on whether </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were using Imperial
units or metric units. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think they just missed coordinators. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they missed coordinated, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's, probably, the
most expensive fuck up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_12> to do with the measuring system. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_07> - That doesn't convince you to go metric, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know what will. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_12> - If you go to a pool-- </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_11> - Flat Earth is celebrating right now. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you go to a pool in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, it's a 25-meter pool,
oh, it's two meters deep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, how far is the journey
the two meter pool? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, it's one mile away." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Its like can we just fucking decide? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_12> - Yeah, that's pretty shitty. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - It's like, we've made
this weird, fucking system </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_05> where we just can't decide
what's gonna be used where, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's totally up to
whoever is the governing body </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of that thing, they decide,
and then that's the thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But nobody seems to have an issue </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with all these metrics
and imperial units mixing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And then there was a
thing in the UK recently, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm pretty sure it
was just outraged bait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get people to be outraged </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about something that wasn't super shady. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were tryna get attention off it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like, we're gonna
bring back the imperial units. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And everyone's like, but why, why, why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_12> Why would we do that? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_08> But then we use Celsius,
we don't use Fahrenheit. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So we don't use that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's like, okay, can
we just fucking decide? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's also another
thing I just can't stand </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> every time I go down there. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - To be honest, the one
thing that pisses me off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the most of any unit and it's
the most frustrating unit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is ounces in America-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, yeah, 'cause they
different in America. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_12> - Because it's fluid ounces and ounces. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> So the bag of Doritos is a
16-ounce bag or something. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> I'm like, what does that mean?
This is like magic to me. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_07> I genuinely don't under... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> This is genuine a runescape quest. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I can't figure this shit out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It might as well be in Elven. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I Got to a two engineers here, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_09> and we go and fucking figure it out. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I barely have some
semblance of what an ounce is, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> I can roughly figure out what ounce is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck is fluid ounces? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have no fucking clue what
fluid all standard ounce is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even know, it
could be a super easy-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - How much you guys weigh in ounces? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - What? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't what I weigh in pounds. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - How do you know that? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I don't, I was just asking. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't even know what I
weigh kilograms right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't measure my weight. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do unfortunately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, out of shape that's who I am. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You must've measured yourself </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> when you did the thingy
test, the medical test. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, like a year ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, things change. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - I've gained weight since then. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - It always creeping up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> we got our next medical tests, scheduled. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - I was 76 kilograms, I think, and I lost, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I'm probably not that anymore </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> but I don't know what that
is in pounds or ounces. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It feel different, bro, feel different. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I have no idea. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - The thing is, now I
know my height in feet </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> more than I remember it in centimeters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know them both. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I'm 182 or three centimeters, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> but I'm not a hundred percent sure </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> just because I'm sitting so long. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - You are taller than
me slightly and I'm 181, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so that makes sense, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - I have to be more than
one centimeter taller </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> than you, right? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Probably, so you're probably 183. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okey, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - 176 or something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - 176.
- You're not that Short. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> You're not that much shorter than me. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Look at this guy. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I'm not 180. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Image being below six feet. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - That's me, bro, that's me. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Image being below 180. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I don't even 181 is six feet or not. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm pretty sure it is six feet. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it is right,
it's like just six feet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even know, it's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - This video is sponsored by Harry's. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Guys are hard to shop for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but whoever you're buying a gift for, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they'll probably want something practical. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> And this year is the year
to give him, Harry's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> There no no better gift </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> than the limited-edition,
holiday shave sets, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> treating the award-winning
Winston handled, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plus handsome and ready-to-give packaging </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for an amazing on boxing moment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Books are great, ties

<SPEAKER_02> Hey guys, back to the episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Going back on the topic
of holidays, though, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> on a big part of holiday
culture, gift giving. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey sighs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How do you guys feel about that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - I hate it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yes Joey. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - I fucking hate it. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't normally feel
pressure until Christmas roll. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> Like this time of year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What pressures you? What
makes you feel bad about it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I don't want to take the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and spend money on something that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in the back of my mind I might think, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this person might not even like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - I absolutely despise buying gifts. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And most of that is because-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Surprise gifts, I especially hate. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - What d'you mean? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - As in like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> - Aah! </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> (Garnt and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - No, no as in like I don't mind-- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Well, Joey, it's funny you say that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (Joey screams and Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Joey, check under your chair right now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> 'cause their is a new Lamborghini. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_11> - Never become friend with Mr. Beast. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_09> (Garnt and Ashely laugh) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah right, even though I am. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's like, I hate... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't mind giving a gift to someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I know that they have told me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, I really want this thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or if they're like next to me for example, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you and I were out shopping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and you said, "Oh, I
really want this thing," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I know your birthday is coming up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> then I'll buy it for you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I know that that'll
be a gift that you like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've I have confirmation of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I hate buying gifts
for like family members </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> or friends that I haven't
seen in a really long time, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> or, maybe I don't even know
all that well, personally, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and being like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> fuck what does this person
even want right now? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> What does this person even like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How much money should I spend? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How much is too cheap,
how much is too expensive? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> And it's like this mental
gymnastics you have to do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> to figure out the perfect gift. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I get decision fatigue,
buying shit for myself. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Like fucking multiply
that by like fucking 50, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> how many gifts I have
to buy for Christmas? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, one day
of Christmas shopping, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like pumped out for a week, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_11> - I barely buy shit for myself, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> what do I know about other people? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You hate gift-giving but
doesn't it feel like good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when you like nail a gift? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like--
- It does feel good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But it also feels good when you win </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> at a game of craps right, it's a gamble. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Craps? What's a craps. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Craps.
- What's that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a gamble game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - What?
- A card game. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - What's a craps?
- Don't worry about craps, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we are talking about gift-giving. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wanna play craps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_11> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - No, it is a great feeling. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> But I find that you only are
able to achieve that feeling </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> once every like 50 gifts
or something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because there's only so many gifts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it is just the perfect gift, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you see their face lights up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> and you're just like, fuck
yeah, that was worth it. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Nah, I like giving gifts it's fun. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - What if it's a gift that you find out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that that person didn't even really like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or doesn't even use, or, you know? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not the point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, one time Meilyne
got me for my birthday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Is Meilyne listening? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Meilyne got me for my birthday, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she got me something I already had. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh really. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> She got me a piece of JoJo
match that I already owned. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Oh no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_11> I didn't mind, to me-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - It's the thought that counts, right? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - That's all nonsense, you know, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I can't buy thoughts,
can't do anything with it. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_04> But like I genuinely appreciated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they'd gotten something that... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, clearly it clearly was a good gift </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I already bought
it, I did wanted it, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't mind 'cause to me it was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't care that they bought me a gift. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> I cared that they cared to get me a gift. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> So if I get you a gift,
to it means I like you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, I get that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> but I'm talking more about
the practicality standpoint. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I'm talking about... </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> To me, I feel like that's social pressure. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Because I like you, I want to make </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the other person feel like I care </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I'm thinking about them, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> which is the entire point I do it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> But on the opposite end, it's
fucking terrifying for me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because sometimes you see a
person, you're can just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have no idea what the
fuck to buy for you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But yeah I care about you but
I have no idea. Like how-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want to buy something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can always default to wine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah but you know, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> you can always default
to wine and whatever </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> but that's the default gift, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_11> that's the adult equvalent of socks. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't wanna just
give all of my friends </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> whiskey and wine right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't wanna go and act, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna be a little more
original about it, yeah? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Like Christmas rolls around,
bring out the wine for each. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - What did Joey get me
this year? Oh, more wine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would like it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's why I think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the Japanese concept
of New Year's Eve money </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> is so big brain to me. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Because in Japan, we have
this thing called otoshidama </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where adults usually, or
parents or grandparents, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they give their younger
like family members money, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> basically pocket money, but
like on a much bigger scale, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> usually it's upwards of 100
bucks, depending on the family. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But in Japan, just the thought of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I am giving this money to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I care about you and your family, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the gift already. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But money becomes a gift right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so it's everyone gives money, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, the gift is that
I'm thinking about you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and that's the process
of giving the money. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - But everyone gives money, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So then now it becomes a thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_12> of how much money am I gonna get? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_09> If it's expected that
you're getting money, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and everyone's getting
money, and you're a kid, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_11> you're gonna be like, how
much weight did you get? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, for me it was like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - As a kid, I would have
preferred money, honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - As a kid yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you don't care about
feelings when you're a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you wanna eat shit and play
X-Box, you don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - As an adult, I can't imagine giving </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a fellow adult money as a gift. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like an insult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_11> - That's kinda like an insult. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_08> Yo, Joey, I know you're going
through some tough times. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> This is a gift, I know you need, dude. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> - Before I put it into the. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_09> - Well, I about this credit
card debt, that shit was wack. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> Here's 20 bucks to fair well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'd be like, oh sick. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_11> - Here's my patreon receipts. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I donated to your patreon recently. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you mentioned Joey, I
hate to argue about this bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You said your dad gave you
money also for your birthdays, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> you don't mind that?
- No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Bro, I'd be like, "Mom
don't give me your money." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, dude, I loved it
when dad gave me money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't need money
bro, don't give me money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - He barely gave me money. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, "I don't need this
from you, mom and dad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You've already paid
for so much of my life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stop giving me money, give
me chocolate or some shit," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - I mean, like now as an adult, I-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Now as an adult I think that way. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, but as a kid? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - As a kid, I'm not aware </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> of how much taxes my dad has to pay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, POV 2021 Christmas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Your dad comes around, he's like, "Joey, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> good kids you are, take this." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Gives you an envelope, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say 200 fine Australian dollars in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> What are you thinking, how do you feel? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'll thinking fuck it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you know how much booze I can buy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt an Connor laughs)
- No, no. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because then, what I would do-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Dad, you ruined the spirit of Christmas. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_12> - Then what I would do is I
would put it back in his face </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> by using that money </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> to buy my dad like some
wine or something, right? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I would, I would use that
gift that he has given me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to give him a gift that
I know my dad would like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - How long do you spend
buying gifts for Christmas? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Barely any. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - It does take a while. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you the kinda person who buys gifts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> a month or two before the
birthday or the celebration? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I mean, I try and do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> within a reasonable amount of
time, a week or two before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - A week or two before? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> Some people do it like
fucking months before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well 'cause I don't wanna go to a store, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> not going to the store, I
refuse going into the store. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Amazon is the thing. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Guys come on. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, I don't really care that much </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_12> but I also care a lot in some senses. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> I really wanna give good
gift to show my appreciation, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> somebody gained a good friend. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_07> So actually I wanna say thank
my homeys, the real ones. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But I would rather know what
exactly it is that you want, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> or at least a general
idea of what you want, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rather than just going in blindly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I understand that, 'cause, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're doing good for ourselves, I think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it becomes very hard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to buy stuff for people who have money, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause you're like, Garnt can
just buy anything he wants, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_11> Joey, can buy anything he wants. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I mean, it comes a point, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> not even if you're doing well or not </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> but like you reach a point in life </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> where a lot of people
around you are adults. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> And people with adults
have disposable income. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it becomes, what's
the socially acceptable amount </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_10> to spend on someone for a gift right? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> Because if you spend too much for someone, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_11> then I feel like-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> - That's pressure on the other person. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - I feel like that's
pressure on the other person. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> Because you spent a lot of
money for an expensive gift. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> I'm like not that I don't
think they'll appreciate it </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_11> but I know how I feel when
I receive an expensive gift, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I'm just like, oh shit okay, now you know. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like the concept
of money essentially, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause like some people who have like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they'd have like 1,000 bucks
in that entire savings. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Some people would blow
that all in gift giving. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause that's how much it means to them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like money doesn't
mean anything if its a gift. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - And not to like undermine
people like that, of course, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you know, like weirdly.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, I completely get what
Garnt says where it's like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> Especially when it's during
a time, like Christmas </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> where you're giving each other gifts, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> if I received something
really expensive from like, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> you know a parent or something right, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> then I would feel really bad, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_00> being like, oh man, you spent
so much money on this gift </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_12> while I gave you a bottle of wine. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_06> - What if that was a $10,000
bottle of wine, Joey come on? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, but what if it
was like a $20 bottle </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of wine, you know? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - (Connor mumbles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Unless the disparicy, what disparity </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, disparity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, the spelling
again, the disparity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Unless the disparity is like a lot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think it matters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> If you buy something for 50 bucks </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> and they buy something
for 150, get over it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah I mean, that
doesn't matter too much </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> but I mean as a uni student, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I remember that was like. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_12> - That was like nine days. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> - But in university, at least what we did, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause we were all broke,
we agreed on a price. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you wouldn't spend
anything above that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - I like that, if you agree on a price, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I like having systems in place. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> What scares me the most is just no rules, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> everywhere, it's a fucking free throw. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, with Sydney or Aki, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> do you agree on how much
you're spending on each other? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No.
- You just kinda like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So Sydney could spend 200 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and you could spend like a grand on her? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I guess yeah, like theoretically. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Theoretically. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have there ever been
in something like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where there's been a big
gap in perceived value. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - No because, I don't
think we tell each other </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> how much it was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I Mean, there's-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know when there's Air Max Jordans. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I know how much that
were when they pop in. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> How would you feel if I got
you a gift and I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> you know how expensive
that shoe was, darling? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, is like, if I knew
the value of the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If it's something that I
obviously follow, I would know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you would know what you paid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - For me and Sydney,
it's different I guess </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> because I know Sydney. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, that's why I'm asking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like I can communicate
with Sydney subconsciously, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> we know, we've been with each other for-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - There've never been an
issue with gift-giving, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that one of you just
bought more than the other? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Aki and I buy each other
gifts all the time, though. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> So it's not really an issue </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> when it comes to birthdays
or Christmas or anything. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - For me, it's just... </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Another thing is as well as, is that </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I think I just suck at shopping. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> If shopping was a ranked
game, I'd be bronze level. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> No, I'd be fucking iron man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like me and shopping-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wouldn't be rock, I
would just be a stone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Gift giving aside me and
shopping is when I shop, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_11> I know exactly what I want. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And if I don't know what I
want, I'm so fucking lost. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I go into a store and I'm just like. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - I try really fucking hard, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> 'cause I'm so bad at knowing
what my friends want. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's why I struggled a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I just spend a lot
of time just thinking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like, all right, well, Garnt mention this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, well, yeah, Garnt kinda into this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I kinda like run
through things in my head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I gonna buy you something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you would never buy for yourself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> that you would someone else buying. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Just how I do gifts. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Meanwhile for me, it's
like, I have to stop myself </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> from texting Garnt and
saying, "What do you want?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> "What do you want for your
birthday?" I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm also not against that,
if someone wants to ask me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> if someone is like,
Connor, what do you want? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, just send JoJo. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But there are people who are
super against that, though. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You know, I'm in the middle of this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm like, I really appreciate giving gifts </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and the whole act of it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but also I understand that
sometimes you can't give gifts, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sometimes you don't wanna give gifts, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> sometimes you don't know
the person well enough, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> so you wanna figure it out,
but you wanna say, "Hey, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> "I appreciate you being
a cool friend or whatever </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> "but I don't know you very
well but you're, you're cool. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> "So let me buy you
something, I know you want." </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah now, because I do like
the feeling of giving a gift, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> and I do think about, I
think, every gift I give. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is like, the issue for me is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a skill that I suck
at, I really, really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Me too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I honestly really suck at it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is why when it comes to
the point, which is Christmas, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> where I have to give gifts, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, I'm shitting myself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, well me fuck me, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have to do shopping for other people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> and I suck at shopping for myself. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And I'm just like, well fuck. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - One thing I've come to
understand as an adult </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> about gift-giving and this is something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that is an easy trap to fall into, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if somebody is really into something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and they talk about it
a lot though, I do this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is my hobby and stuff,
it's really easy to think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, I can just buy something
to do with that hobby, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then that'll work out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's like a terrible idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because if you don't understand the hobby </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well as they do, you'll
probably not buying something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> that's as useful as you think to them, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause they probably have a vast knowledge </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> of the said thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah and it's also a problem </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when the hobby that they talking about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> is also a collection
that they follow right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So every time Aki's birthday
or Christmas rolls around, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like, oh, I can just buy her </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something Kingdom Hearts related. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I remember, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> she literally has everything
Kingdom Hearts related. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> So I'm like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - It's just like, if you want
to buy something for them </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> in that collection, if
they already don't own it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then that's such a rarity right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not going to happen,
because they probably... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> If they don't have something
that they don't already own, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they already know they don't own it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And maybe they've already
tried to get it and they can't. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And if you can get it,
that's a fucking banger gift. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's happened a few times before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> and I'm just like, fuck yeah man, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I can't wait to give this gift. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Because you know, sometimes
you just buy a gift </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> and you just can't wait to give it, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're just like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's what's so
magical about gift-giving, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but my problem is that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so rare to find
that one fucking gift, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you fucking nail out of the park </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> and you're fucking excited
to give it, and it's so hard. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's why 99% of the time, I suck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I want to do better.
- What do you do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you normally to go for? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - What I normally go for? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Wine.(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What did you get me last year? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't remember what you got on me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (calming upbeat music) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Am I bad friend for not remembering? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean both of you two..(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> So it must not have anything that-- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I remember. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I gave you an galleon ten tie thing?* </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like the-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The tie pin, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Bonginious. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I remember giving you that. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - 'Cause I remember the
last gift I've got you, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_04> which was the wine
decanter, that was for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor mumbles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Thank you very much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I remember you got me... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean that was for your birthday, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and for my birthday, you
got me a cigar-holding case. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah the de solidifying Box. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - I got you a Kurino. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's a Kurino? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - The Oreimo girl, the figure eight. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I got him a Kurino figure eight. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because I remember that was
the first gift I gave you guys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for the first Christmas, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I which is I remember going
with the JoJo figures. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- That's right, yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's hard. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_11> - It's hard. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - It is hard, 'cause I was like, you know, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> it's like I know Garnt has a
vague interest in this thing. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think he's too in deep in it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I think I can buy something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to push the hobby a little more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's scary because as you said, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if it's something that, you
know they're really into </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's like, how are they gonna feel </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if I get them another one? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - 'Cause I wanna give
them something unique. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I wanna give them something </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> where it's like, they will look at it </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> and go, oh, I remember
when Joey gave me that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> But that's so hard. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I'm jealous of like, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> whenever I see Meilyne gives gifts, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Meilyne's just like
fucking challenge of rank </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> S-tier gift giver, man. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Like sometimes she gives gifts
to Sydney and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> fuck, why are you going to
do me like this, Meilyne? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Meilyne give me a JoJo umbrella, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's was pretty good,
I have always wanted one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Meilyne knew I wanted one, so she got one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Meilyne, just knows. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Meilyne, knows where to get </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> all the cool things you
wouldn't normally think about, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> and I'm just like how? Like teach me. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Mean while for me I'm
like, I look on Amazon, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> it's not there, I give up. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm like Meilyne, teach me like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - You all need a pool,
what do mean by pool? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_11> (they all chuckle) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_09> - A whole pool. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Puddle pool?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah definitely.
- Sorry. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> (calming upbeat music) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - I don't know what I was gonna say. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - I interrupted you, am sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The poor escort of "Trash taste". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - What's the most you've
ever spent on a gift </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> or ever received? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got my mom a phone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, no plane tickets, I
got her plane tickets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I bought my dad like a
$10,000 car engine. (laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, my God, Jesus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause he has this 1960s
beetle, vintage beetle car, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause he loves vintage cars. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I bought Mom a
Ferrari too as well actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And, and he was like, son... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Always starts his emails with "son." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hello son, may I borrow
some money from you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to buy this slight engine, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I'm tryna rebuild this beetle. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I realized that was the
moment where I realized, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I hadn't really given a lot
of gifts to my dad, growing up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's always been like small stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It usually get to that age, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> where you really start to
appreciate your parents, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when you don't
live with them anymore right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was just like, I'll
just give it to you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Just, you don't have to
give me back the money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I never seen my dad cry in my life time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and that was the moment he cried. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And he was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> everything that's in my will
aimed towards your sister, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm rewriting it to you. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So, you get the record collection,
you get all this stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> My sister's like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Give dad 10 grand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Give dad 10 grand, gets the whole Will. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Big brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that was the
most I've ever spent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But that's like a gift, though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that I feel was long overdue. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That wasn't just one gift,
that was like a collective gift </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> for all the years I haven't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - I feel like I've given my parents </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> some pretty big gifts as well. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> And that was just because I
just wanted to show my gratitude </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> for just fucking raising me
and hopefully raise me, right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> Thank you very much mom and dad. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't think I gave that to my dad </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for a birthday or anything, I
was just like, you know what, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just take, it's fine. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, because those
are the gifts, I feel, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> where you can't wait to give away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I remember,
luckily, I've had a moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> where I've also made my parents
cry from happiness as well, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or maybe hopefully shed a tear, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and I'm just like, damn! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's the best feeling. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That is the best feeling. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] That's the best feeling. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I remember, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> probably the most surprising
gift I got actually </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was a PS4 from Sydney. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this was back when we
had just started dating. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So she wasn't working or anything </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or she was kind of working
like part-time jobs </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or whatever onsite </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> but she barely had any
money to support me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So at the time, I wasn't
expecting too much from her, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we celebrated
Christmas at their place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and she gives me all the small presents, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then she goes, there's one more thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's always one more thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's one more thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, what are you talking about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How can there be one more thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Sydney, I know you don't
make any money, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've seen that at Cambridge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And she brings out this massive box. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, what is
this? What is going on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I opened it up and it's a fucking PS4 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and at that time, we
weren't doing so well okey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was fucking a gust. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_10> Is that the right word? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> Flabbergasted, I don't
know, I was fucking shocked. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> It was the first time in my life </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> that I think I was truly just speechless. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> And I remember she keeps telling me about </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> that one moment that
she gave me that gift. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> She's, still chasing that
high, she's chasing that high. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> (all chuckle) </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_09> - Never gonna happen again. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_10> - That huddle is like up here. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Every year she tries
to like one-up herself, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> we both tried to reach that moment </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where we give the gift that
just stuns the other person, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that she keeps talking
about that one moment. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And like, she's chasing the high, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> You think doing cocaine is good? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Give your loved one a
gift they don't expect. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - That was me when Aki gave me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> the giant berserk figure for my birthday. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Garnt] Oh man. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That was when I was like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's a keeper right there, boys. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> She knows what I want. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - How the fuck does she even
hide that gift from you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh, she didn't. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it arrived, I think like
two weeks before my birthday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't how she was
trying to hide it from me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I opened the door </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and there was seven,
giant, fucking like boxes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Happy birthday. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And she was like, happy birthday, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I wanted to keep it a secret. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, this is bigger than my room. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> how the fuck are you
excepting to hide this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then I opened it, it was
the fucking berserk figure. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It was great. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Bro, that's crazy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I haven't really given any massive gifts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> just 'cause I don't think
the occasions come up. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you ever had a
moment where you gave a gift </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> and you're like, damn, this
is a good feeling right now? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every time I give a
gift card, every time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Every gift's a bad ass. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't miss. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> - Always go for that high. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_08> - Every time I get a
bottle of Evian, needed. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's one of those things where, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> as much as I love to be like, yeah, dude, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I spent like 100 grand and this one gift </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to save the kid's life, it's like, fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - We'll get the one day. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hopefully. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_11> Hopefully we'll get the one there one day. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> - Yeah, man. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - You know what I'm gonna
get you for Christmas? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_11> - What are you gonna get me? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Some Tesla stock.
- Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> - I know that's what
you like nowadays right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt and Joey laughing)
- Oh, God, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_12> - I got you a ethereal. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Can you even buy some? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - I bought you some NFTs? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh great, oh fucking fantastic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I bought you an NFT of pepe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Investment bankers be
like, yo bro, don't worry, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> I got you the biggest gift. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_04> - A solid portfolio of good stocks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's how people on Wall Street </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> celebrate with each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got you some training
options in the stock and its, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_11> - That's just such a funny image to me. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> Really, you bought me bonds, now? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> D'you think I want bonds, really? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - In this market, really? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - I sell off some fucking
bitcoins and fucking crypto </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> to get a fucking-- </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dodge now, really? In this economy? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm also giggle lazy, so
when I have an understanding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> with someone mutually, on our birthdays, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we do lazy gifts,
like me Ditis and Emily, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> we always just buy each other
League of Legends skins. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You buy steam games as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - No, just legal legends skins. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> We don't even play League of Legends much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - That's negative gift
giving, I swear to God. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - They give it to me
under my American account. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So even if I were to play, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't get to play
on that account often. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I like the point of them buying skins </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for me there is like useless. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's like me buying Garnt like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a fucking 10-roll on a Gacha.(laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't, don't, don't bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - Don't tell me, bro, don't tell me. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bro, it's like buying
Garnt a fucking U23, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and me ancestry kits, you
just found out who fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Here is a 100 bucks go to the casino. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just one of those
things where we all agree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> We're good-enough friends
to buy each other gifts, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but we're also very lazy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> So let's not buy each other
gifts that require effort. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - My presence is a gift. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - How do you min-max gift buying? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - You're, that guy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're that guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - How'd you min-max gift buying? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean, by
every one the same gift? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - How do you optimize gift buying? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Buy every one the same gift, easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, this is a call. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Like if anyone has any advice
on how to give cool gifts, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> then please teach me. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_07> - How d'you be that cool
guy during Christmas? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - How would you be Meilyne? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I could just ask Meilyne
but I don't think she-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pay attention to everyone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and listen carefully to what they say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Pay attention! That
sounds like so much effort. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> - Why do you think I became a YouTuber? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_11> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'll listen to myself. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> - You gotta listen? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> - So I don't pay attention. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You think I don't like
the sound of my own voice? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Come on guys, come on. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am aware of videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> - Just don't buy me </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> something I can win in a
crane game, please I beg you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> I got enough of that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - What if I take you to a crane game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I win it in front of you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, that's even worse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No? But this' the experience, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would I wanna
watch you win my prize? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let me win my price.
I pay for it, I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - I want Darren Brown to teach me. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> You know, I remember
when I saw that episode. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I don't know if we've talked about </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> this exact episode before. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> But we've talked about Darren
Brown, who is a mentalist, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> and he has this one episode where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is it Simon Pegg, comes in? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's that's the name
of the celebrity, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Ginger guy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Simon Pegg. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So he comes in and he
talks about gift giving. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And Darren Brown goes,
instead of thinking about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> what gift to buy someone,
he buys someone a gift </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> and convinces them that,
that's the gift he wants. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And that's just like, Gigabrain, man. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> That's what I need to learn. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, man, just go
through the whole PhD, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> become one of the best in
the world, good luck, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - I'll fucking do it.(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I'll fucking do it just to
become a good gift giver. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Spend nine years in college </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to become the best gift giver.
- How do he convince them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So he bought him a BMX. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's I can't do the clip justice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> because I think it's to do with NLP </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where he gives Simon Pegg a speech. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's the
NFT staff.(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So he gives Simon Pegg a speech, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the speech includes some
it's like subtle suggestion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> of what he should have or
what he should want as a gift. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And he reveals, afterwards, what he said, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> and why everything he said </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> leads into him wanting a BMX bike. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's sounds like a bullshit to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> No one's gonna convince
me I want a BMX bike. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like it's gonna
be hard to convince me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - I wouldn't say no, to a BMX bike. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know you won't, Joe,
you'll tear that shit up bro, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you'll hit the park. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_10> - But what's the last
time you rode a BMX bike? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I was 12, I dunno. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_11> - You don't I miss that? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You don't? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I really miss it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Wait did you never go
through the skater, BMX bike </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> that kind of phase.
- Yeah, I did, yeah. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was raised in the
'90s, of course I did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - You never wanna relive
a bit of that childhood? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> - No. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't wanna re-live it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't wanna re-live the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought Tony Hawk was God phase? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Tony Hawk's not God, what d'you mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So yeah, would you not
wanna go into BMX again? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was a skateboard.(laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah or a skateboard. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't care, I didn't
really like them that much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel he was just the god </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of extreme sports and games in general. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I liked the idea as a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I tried it, I would
shit at it, I didn't enjoy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] That's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I was like, yeah, I'm okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm really not concerned, I hurt myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm gonna go back and play Xbox. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like broke my leg. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I saw my friends snap his ankle into half. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think I'm gonna go back
inside and play Mario Brothers. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I'm okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm gonna go back
inside and play Tony Hawk. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - I think I really liked Tony Hawk, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> but I couldn't escape for my life, man. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Playing Tony Hawk was funner
than actual skating for me. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - True, true. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Offensive gone but yeah, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> you strike me as the kind
of guy who could not skate. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> Doesn't he? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt, is like the antithesis of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would not feel
comfortable on a skateboard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Really? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] You do give off
that vibe, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_10> - What about me? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_00> Come on, I'm curious, what about me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, back in the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> there's no 10-hour YouTube
tutorials for you to watch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> to get on the fucking board. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnts like, mother there's
no tutorials, I can't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Is it 'cause I can't
snowboard, is that it? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, actually, a snowboarding's fine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have a good effort at snowboarding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I reckon you'd be a good snowboarder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't skateboard, I can snowboarder. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah I dunno, I was
really into rollerblading. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Me too.
- I dunno. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Rollerblading was like my
thing, I was never into skating. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Rollerblading feels like really white. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It feels like the white
version of skateboarding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- [Garnt} Is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It feels like, I'm a suburban
kid who I can't skateboard, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I'm gonna go on roller blades. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But I saw skateboarding as that as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Isn't skateboarding </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> the most suburban-kid-thing you could do? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, I was about to say. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, I guess so, yeah,
maybe I'm wrong on that. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I'm probably wrong on that. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I did rollerblading, so I just
assumed it was the lane thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was doing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - See, I couldn't roller
blade and that's why I skated. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - I couldn't skate, which
is why I rollerbladed. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's like the Pokémon
versus Digimon argument </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> all over again right.(laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Another Garnt fails like
consumed liquid in his mouth. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - And it has been zero days
since Garnt missed his mouth. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah fuck, I wish I was better at it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean I can snowboard and ski, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess I'll take that instead, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I skateboarded, but I wasn't doing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for the king flips or anything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - It was a mental thing,
because like I always wanted, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> I never had an interesting
learning how to skate, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but snowboarding always seemed cool to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - In the morning. I love snowboarding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanna go back to snowboarding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> When are we going on a tour
on the next skiing trip? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Whenever you wanna go. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - When does it start snowing in Japan? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - December, right. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, it depends where you are. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Oh yeah, sure. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - It's probably already
snowing in Hokkaido. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Japan seasons is like so weird for me. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> We're like deep in November
now, so it's Winter. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> It doesn't fucking feel
like Winter outside. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> It's so weird how it's still fucking hot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I still have days where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do I wear a jumper today or
it's still a T-shirt weather? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm used to England and
November in England is just... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> No, fucking Summer in England
is permanent cold weather. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Let alone fucking November. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Well to be fair peak
snow season in Japan </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> is like mid January. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's been hot the last
few days for some reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's been hot this entire fucking year. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's weird, it went cold for a week. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> And I was like psych, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and then it went back to
like 20 degrees Celsius, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> and I'm like it's November! </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's all the typhoons fucking it all up. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's November bro. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_12> - Does it mean we get like
a really short Winter? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_07> - Probably.
- 'cause I want a long winter. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I want it all to be Winter, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - (laughing) I know you do. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't want summer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't want summer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can we like boycott Summer? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - Can we cancel Summer?
- Let's cancel Summer. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_11> - I want my sunshine,
give me my sunshine, man. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can get sunshine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Why didn't Gru from
"Despicable Me" steal the sun. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the real questions.(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - I haven't seen "Despicable Me". </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why? It's good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I haven't seen it either, man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> - Is that the Minions movie? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's got Minions in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's a separate movie. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_12> Minions is a stand-alone. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_03> - Minions is a spinoff of "Despicable Me". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - God garnt, "Despicable Me" one, two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and three are all standalone movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> One is good, two is all
right, three is all right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I haven't seen any of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I just seen enough memes,
thrills most to know that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Steve Carell best performance of today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is it a good movie? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Despicable Me" is it
actually a good movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, sometimes you just see a movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just been memed up so much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you don't know if it's actually good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - "Despicable Me One" is a
good movie, I'll stand by that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I just can't stand the Minions. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I just love Steve Carell,
he's just so charming. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, but there's other
moves with him in it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that don't involve "Minions." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I don't mind the "Minions" that much. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hate when they made
the Minions more of a thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause they did that later on,
'cause they were so popular. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Oh so it's not that much of
a thing in the first movie? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Not as much. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Okay that's good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I just hate the fact </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that "Minions" just never died in Japan. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Why, why has it not died in Japan? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I did walk past a clothing
store the other day, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that was all "Minions" clothes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Oh, I walked past minions
store in Akihabara as well. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> A minion store in Akihabara. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Imagine weaves disappointment
when they go to Akihabara </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> and the first thing they see
is a fucking minion store. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> - It is a enemy in Japan. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - It is a enemy in Japan, that is true. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Why do they not have that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> with other Pixar Dreamworks fellows? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Why do we not have a Shrek... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Where's the Shrek store?
I wanna Shrek store. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Shrek two", I don't think
it would be popular in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - Where's the Cars store. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I believe that's called the dealership. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Cars was Pixels most
successful franchise monetarily, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause of all of the merchandise. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is it?
- Is it actually? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, 'cause they sold so many toys </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and figures, I believe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can look that up actually,
but I'm near certain that-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not "Minions?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because think about it,
Cars is a franchise right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Think of all the merch
you can make from cars, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> kids love cars. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - All I can think of is like Hot Wheels. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can literally make like
a bazillion different types </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like car merchandise, it's so easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - But Japan has proved </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that you can make a
bazillion different types </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> of minions merch as well. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I see more minions merch than I... </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_12> Does cars have an entire
store in Akihabara? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> I don't think so. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - But it doesn't matter,
I'm telling you, man. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> He's googling it as we speak,
he's taking so long there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the worst fact-checking FfC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - You could probably make a video of, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I spent an entire year on
nothing but minions merch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, you could. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm pretty sure there's enough minions-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is there a minion food? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Probably.
- Probably. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> Bananas. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - They have the minion
popsicle, have you seen that? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You've seen the youtube
videos of people trying... </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's a YouTube series </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where people just try
and get the popsicles </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to look like the characters. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So they keep up opening them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And they never looked like them </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but trying to get those closest possible. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That shit is so random. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I did see the clip on Twitter. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Of this guy, the SpongeBob one,
that actually looks like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the guy freaks out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's like, (gasps)
I finally found!(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - 'Cause they never looked like SpongeBob. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's just completely--. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Was it like official popsicles </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> or popsicles that people make? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, official like color popsicles. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - You take the band and
then you rip them open, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they pull out and never
looks at the character. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So people are like obsessed
with trying to find ones </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that looked like the character. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I used to eat the Toy
Story ones religiously. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - They had Toy Story ones? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they had had like a,
what do you want in Australia? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> And it looked hideous. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Is it just because I've moved to Japan </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> that I've noticed this </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_09> or do Japanese merchandise
have so many collaborations, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> more than you than you would
expect than in other countries? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, of course, they have like 20 times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> any promotional thing ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because Japan is so good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> at milking out something that's popular </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> until it's dry as a bone. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, because it was so weird </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> every time I go to like the
supermarket or the combini </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> and I swear, there's a
different collaboration </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> going on every time. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> It's like, if there's not
a collaboration going on, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I'm sure Japan is going
through a typhoon or something </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> or like a natural disaster just happened. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> It's always the coffees or
the ice creams or something. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was Demons Slay
coffees for a for a bit, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> now it's just the Kaisen coffees. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't like that,
'cause to me it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're just sticking the character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the fucking models-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] That's just the tacky way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's fucking lazy, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Make it taste like it's piss or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Dude people die for that, bro. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_10> It's the thing, collectors
are all over that, dude. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> That's the thing, the
inside has nothing to do </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_09> with the character or the franchise. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's just on the fucking package. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> It's, I dunno, makes less
rubbish, maybe, fuck, I dunno. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I went to the combini right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the had a Demon Slayer fried chicken. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd ask for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Demon Slayer fried chicken! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> - What do you think it is? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> What makes it Demon Slayer fried chicken? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> Absolutely nothing. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_05> The box it comes in has fucking Tanjiro, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_12> and Nezuko on it. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> And you know the flavor is, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> what's the most Demon Slayer
flavor you can think of? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Demon. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Right. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> Not a fucking cod roe, it's just cod roe </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> and cheese or something. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> What is this? Is this
the fucking Demon Slayer? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_11> - What was BTS about
the BTS McDonald's Meal? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I never got it, so-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Good point actually. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - All the Travis Scott meal as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was marketing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I guess, they had BTS on the bank? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> I'll be honest with you, we weren't there. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> - They had BTS lyrics on the back again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - He did his job 'cause I heard about it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> I'd never even bought
that fucking meal, but-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you say they have BTS
clubs here with like anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There was one that was Mint. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was a BTS and Mint collaborative. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> Just like mints. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I was like, okay. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - So like what was so good with BTS? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Nothing. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I think it's pretty cool in
the sense, though, because-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it is cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, Japan does
so many collaborations, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that some of them are
just really fucking cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> But then you also get a
lot of messes as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - A lot of messes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, a lot of messes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The coolest one I think
I saw it was eyedrops </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> but it had the Hatsune
Miku at the front of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it kinda makes sense </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it was marketed
as like, it's to help you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for people who are staring
at a screen for a while. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And also the liquid was a
Hatsune Miku bluish green. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I'm like, that
collaboration makes sense </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> but Demon Slayer tampons
don't make any fucking sense. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah it's strange 'cause-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Are you kidding me, I'd
fucking buy Demon Slayer tampons? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Hell the fuck, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But its just like Nezuko's
mouth piece.(all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_11> - I thought you could just
gonna say Demon Slayer coffee </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't make sense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_11> I'm just like the coffee collaboration </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> is just the one collaboration where </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> it's the clear fall of
collaborations, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> It's when it's when the people
don't know how to collab </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> and just have run out of ideas </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and just like just put it on coffee. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - The only time where the
coffee collaboration made sense </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> was when they did that
collab with Tokyo ghoul. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> That was the only time where I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> finally it makes sense. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> What does Jutsu Kaisen
have to do with Coffee? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Gojo drink coffee in one episode. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah clearly. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you see the,(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> there was like an ice
cream "Demon Slayer One". </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And it was Nezuko was like biting thing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Or like it was something
where it was like you eat it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh the bamboo thing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah and it just felt like a dick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey, Connor and Ashely laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_12> It was like a stick and you eat it. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> I don't know what it was,
but it looked like a dick, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> it looked like a green dick. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> (Connor and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_09> - I did actually see that one.(laughing) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> I know the exact one you're talking about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it like a pink hole or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - (laughing) I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I gotta look this up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - I just remember looking at it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_10> and oh this past product design did it. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - It looked like a Demon
Slayer, like cucumber. </SPEAKER_10>

<SPEAKER_02> Back to the video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The one thing that's really
odd is that Japan is so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> protective over it's like
charachters and it's copyright </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and all that stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But they're like, yeah sure put on Kaiju </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on your fucking detergent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> Like, like what, how does that make sense? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't understand this. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Talking about the Levi detergent? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, that like Levi-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - That makes sense though. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I've seen it with many characters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I saw at a store, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - it was bleach.
- I saw a Demon Slayer once. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was literally just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like a Tomie's
boy's game,(Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_12> like Uta no prince or something. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> It was something along those lines, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> and am like why is this on bleach? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> What does this have to do with it, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> I don't understand. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> Like these are characters
that you would like, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> your company lawyer would kill </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> if somebody mentioned them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and showed an image on a YouTube video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like God forbid, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God forbid someone does that, but oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You want to put it on
your, your toilet paper? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, go ahead. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah I didn't get that man. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> It's weird, it's really strange. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah I mean some of the
strangest collaborations </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I've seen, I like from Eva. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> Eva is the one franchise
where I don't think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they have limits like literally </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think like every product
under the sun has worked </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> with some kind of Eva collaboration. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - If the brand exists Eva
has collabo with them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've seen everything from
like food, to glasses, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> to toilet paper with Eva and I'm like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> well I know what I'm buying. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - I do like Eva, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> you could literally live </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> out your entire life just
on fucking Eva merch. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I think the weirdest
one I've seen is like, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> you can buy like an official
Eva marriage certificate. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> (Joey and Ashely laughing)
Right? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> So you, you can have an Eva themed wedding </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> with Eva wedding rings </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> and have your marriage
certificate printed out </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> as an official Eva marriage
certificate collaboration </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - To be fare Key studios gave me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> official Clannad marriage certificates. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Oh my. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still have those. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wonder why God knows about
getting married in flavor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Mmmmh.
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honey get my blue suit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_11> - Honey get in the ribon,
we're getting married. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, you guys will soon find out </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> that I'm having an Eva themed
wedding, man am just kidding. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'm rocking out with my plugsuit theme. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm just like, where are the Eva suits? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> I want my Eva suits, man. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> We got JoJo suits. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like the actual plugsuit? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_12> (Joey and Gart laughing) </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because Eva is for
children, JoJo is for men. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey, Garnt and Ashley laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why maybe that's
why they have Eva diapers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> and not JoJo's. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why do they not have JoJo diapers? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> - Because JoJo (chuckles)
fans don't shit themselves. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - (Gant laughing) JoJo fans are the type </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> to wear JoJo diapers. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> - JoJo fans are the type
of fans to shit themselves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just leave it there
and deal with it later. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - They'll shit in their JoJo underwear. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - JoJo fans are the type who
would wear like a $500 suit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> but also where the JoJo diapers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> so they don't have to take
it off to go to the toilet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the type of JoJo fans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wait, you taking a suit off
when you go to the toilet? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> What do you do? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_04> (mumbles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Sometimes the shit
is powerful, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you gotta take the whole suit on. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> Don't worry, you got the
diapers underneath it, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> so you don't even have to worry. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, it's so weird. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> But like feel like, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> do you think collaborations </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> with like other franchises
outside of Japan </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> would do as well in other countries? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think that again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the only one I can
think of is like Disney. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we don't give a shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if the thing like isn't
related, I feel if like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if like Mickey mouse is
promoting laundry detergent, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, okay, whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - It doesn't make better
detergent, probably not. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But if Popeye's on spinach
okay yeah we've got another. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, if it's
related to the character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - An Among Us trashcan.(laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - A squid game square-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would buy that, to be fare. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> That's, pretty fucking cool to be fare. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> Would I buy a packet of frozen lasagna </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> if it had Garfield on it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Probably. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> - Probably. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - If it makes sense for the character, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm way more likely to buy it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> Also be very, much judgmental about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I'll buy it if I'm not like
paying out the offer, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like I'm not gonna buy
fucking Garfield lasagna </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if it costs twice as much
as the regular lasagna. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - True </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I buy just like, see
what It tastes like. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> - Probably like lasagna, to
be honest, it was like, well, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it like oh this tastes like Chris Pratt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_11> - I feel like there should
be more collaborations though </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> you do get some fun items
every now and again. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And it works cause people
fucking talk about it right. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - That is true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - To be fair, the only like collaboration </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm thinking of that could
probably work really well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Overseas is maybe like Minecraft stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was just so much Minecraft stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah I mean, there's already
so much Minecraft toys. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> All right so like why
would you not collaborate? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know what the best
promotion I've seen in Japan is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> featured in one of my videos. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> You know, the goldfish, a little crisps. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - The one with Pokémon, then
they were in shapes of Pokémon. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Pokémon collabs never miss. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pokémon has done such
a fucking good job where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like, because all you have
to do it when it comes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> to like snacks or food or anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> just shape it like a Pokémon </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - They could like make an
official Pokémon AK 47. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It would probably look sick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it would probably let
work, it would probably work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> They put fucking plane in
Pokémon, why stop there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> Go to fighter jets you know. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> WMDs why are we waiting for man? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_07> - I want my Pokémon Panzer tank.(laughs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, do call it, call
it nuke volts hole, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then put that red and white bro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> it makes its canonical sense. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Nuke electrode use explosion,
they are super effective. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_12> (Joey, Garnt and Ashley laughing) </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, Pokémon is so easy to market </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> that it literally works with everything. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> 'Cause you've got like-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, she is the vessel
that's why Pokémon arguably </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_12> is like one of the most successful
franchises in the world. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Which is why I was shocked
to find out that Hello kitty </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_05> was also close, nearby
in terms of success, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause Hello Kitty is shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - If it's not marketed
towards me, its shit.(laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> - How can you brand Hello Kitty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same way you can
Pokémon, I don't understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because girls like Hello Kitty. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hello Kitty is massive,
it is fucking massive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because girls like cute things. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like me saying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> girls like to Menstruate,
of course they do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> why would they do it so often? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Am not sure about that man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like am assuming what they like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (all mumble) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_11> - Wait I'm trying to like
follow this mental gymnastics </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> that you just did, like how did </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_12> you equate Hello kitty
to menstruation?(laughs) </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause to me, when you
say girls like Hello Kitty, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that just sounds like, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that sounds like the boomer dad was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Of course girls like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hello Kitty it pink and its kinda kitty?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah but that's you
relating that to menstruation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> is saying that every
time a woman menstruates </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_12> they're like, yay! </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Well I'm saying that the
expansion was in the Duma </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> I would think about the bone. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_06> An 80 year old Duma male would
think the same way right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know about that one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_12> - Why would you menstruate
so much if you din't like it? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_11> - Hello kitty tampons we
found the new collaboration. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Match made in heaven right there. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> That's gonna happen when,
when is that happening? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like it's stupid I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_11> - What were we talking about
before this, I can't remember. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why is Hello Kitty so successful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I get it that it has an audience, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mostly it doesn't have an audience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> But like a worldwide juggernaut
audience I don't know. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - There's a lot of people into it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know what, any singular
person who is a die-hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hello Kitty fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Bullshit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like most Japanese women I know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's just Japanese women. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like Pokémon is worldwide. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - God forbid there is only like five </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of them in the world.(chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know anyone in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you know any people in Australia? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, I know some people
who are like super it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I know a lot of people
who are like hardcore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> into like anything Sanrio. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sanrio is different from Hello KItty, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause Hello Kitty is like
juggernaut on its own. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah but Hello Kitty is Sanrio. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I know but at the hello
kitty franchise on its own, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> is that one of the biggest in the world. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And to me-- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's because Hello Kitty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it has just become like an icon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> It's that it's become so big </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that it's independent of, Sanrio. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's an icon, but at
the same time, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know anyone who's
a big fan of Hello Kitty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_10> - Okay, why-- </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> - Just like compared to Pokémon, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> which is universally anywhere
in the world, you go, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_02> people love Pokémon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why is Pokémon so big? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> - Because it's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Wow, great argument there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_11> - I can say the same thing
about how Hello Kitty.(laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> - Well what's amazing about it? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause Pokémon is like cornered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every single godamn market. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like any kind of entertainment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> in the market Pokémon is in it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Hello Kitty is not the same. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like it's in the meme,
"We are not the same." </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_12> - "We are not the same" </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - It's like, if you think about it, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> Pokémon has its hands in
every single goddamn pie </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> and it pleases everyone. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> Hello Kitty is in like
what, just merchandise now? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_11> - Because I don't know if I'm like-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probably in card games,
games, TV shows, movies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Literally fucking anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Because I like, I don't know </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> if I've just haven't been paying attention </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> but it felt like Pokémon just got like </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> a Pokémon go like a second wave </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> within like the past few years. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And I don't know if I just
wasn't paying attention </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> and maybe Pokémon had just a slowly </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> become more and more popular </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> but like it feels like it
was even more popular now </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> than it was when it
exploded when I was a Kid. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a cycle, yeah people get bored </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of it cause they play it too
much. They come back into. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I would argue as someone
who's been with it from start </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> to finish this just
constantly been like this. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - It's just constantly been like that? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> - Maybe, I don't know. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I mean it feels like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Maybe for the adult
generation it's gone like that. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - There is that nostalgia factor right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - 'Cause I mean, yeah,
Pokémon was the craze. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> It was a franchise that
fucking exploded onto the world </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> became like a worldwide sensation. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And then I felt like at
least living in the UK, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I felt like the hype for
Pokémon kind of died down </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> and it kind of became
like a nerd thing again. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And now it's just kind of
becoming mainstream again. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And like you, we have like the new, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> like fucking Pokémon card phase now </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> where these have now become </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> like expensive collector's item. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And it's just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> It's not that I didn't expect it. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> It just, I don't know
if I missed something </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> or if something amazing happened </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> that I wasn't paying attention to. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - I feel like it's because Pokémon </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in the past couple of years, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> especially has really atleast in Japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> has like really started branching out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> with what it collaborates with. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I'm thinking back on
it now, like back in the day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like when we, when Pokémon
first came out, we were kids, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there wasn't really a lot
of like Pokémon elaboration. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There was Pokémon merch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but nothing to collaborate
with an already pre-existing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, you know, brand, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> But now you have like
fucking Adidas and Nikie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and like all these like huge clothes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just wouldn't put it in
the same level as Hello Kitty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Hello kitty,has done collabos </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with things like Gucci as well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I know that I have, but
it's just not the same. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Like it's not the same-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's not the same
because I don't like it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We are not the same. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I just know right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> just straight out I
think it's not the same. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Well, maybe just you
haven't been in enough places </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> where headache kitty is popular. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> 'Cause I feel like its more popular in-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I think it's just because
you haven't associated yourself </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> with anyone who's actually-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I don't know the numbers I'm like, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> not particularly like a mega fan of both. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ashley, can you look at the
most successful franchises </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was Hello Kitty and Pokémon,
I know Pokémon's won I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_10> - Is Pokémon won? The
most successful franchise? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_11> - I think so yeah. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - In the world? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Above like Disney? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well yeah because
there's no single property </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that Disney has that is bigger than like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, because then knew
you'd argue instead of Pokémon, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> if you Nintendo, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Ashely] I Googled
most successful franchise </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and number one at McDonald's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Entertainment. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Number one is Pokémon, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where is Hello Kitty on that list? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Let me see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's in the like top five. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, I think it's top 10. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think it's like six or seven, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Second is Hello Kitty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes you got me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah number two Hello Kitty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Would you like, would you
seriously be like, yeah dude, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no doubt, Pokémon number
one, Hello Kitty second. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like when you hear Hello Kitty second, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that doesn't sound right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah, it doesn't sound right. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - You're right in that, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> but to me Pokémon also
doesn't sound right. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or, maybe, no Pokémon
does what would you say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has had a bigger effect on like the world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like Mario maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah like Mario-- </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would say Pokémon is
way bigger than Mario. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah Pokémon, I mean it is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - I feel like maybe because
Pokémon you're right </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_10> does have its fingers in so
many pies in terms of like, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> in terms of like making money, </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> in terms like merchandising
and collaborations. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_10> Yeah Pokémon is king and I
can see why it's number one </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of like how famous it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like the widespread appeal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I would still say there
are bigger icons in the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I think Pete could
choose a bigger icon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> The merrier you think so? I think so. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> You think so? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> I think pick a shoe is more
recognizable than Mario. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you do, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> do you think shoe is more
recognizable than Mickey mouse? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - No </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. I think, I think Mickey mouse is, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> I think I would even argue
almost that maybe Hallo Kitty </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> is all well-known as a character. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I guess that doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause that's not like a heart, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - I would argue that that
might be the whole reason. Why. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, I mean, by success, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I assume you mean financial success to me, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> financial success, doesn't
always equate to what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> is the most recognizable icon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> But the franchise, you know, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> but I wouldn't in terms of like power </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the ability to push
something like yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, Hello kitty is like
nothing compared to Pokémon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> in my mind. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - As a brand recognition, I is so much. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Which is why like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> when I think when I think
of successful franchises, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> successful icons. Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> I think of stuff like Mickey
mouse, Mario, stuff like that. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And like, to me, the
whole Pokémon sensation </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> is just, it was like, it
kind of like blindsided me. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Cause I knew Pokémon was big. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I didn't know it was that big. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - 1996 it was the single
most googled thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - I believe that, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> That's 1996 though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - But like that's when the game came out </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - But that's like it only got bigger, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> like to think that I want like Google, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> like to think that it
was the most such thing, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> do you know how crazy. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> That is, that is insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Porn exists gone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Legitimate, a universal
love of that people online. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like how? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - How does it beat that? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Pokémon porn. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Googling Pokémon. Meanwhile
gone was Googling deep. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Start from AGS. You know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Where's Minecraft on that list. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Oh yeah. Minecraft's like massive now. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> As well as the. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Minecraft in recent
years has become a massive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so weird because it's
franchises like Pokémon, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like Minecraft, where you
have this initial explosion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then everyone thinks
it's just going to die down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they did it and it does die down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And then it comes back
with like a vengeance. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> It's like the sequel man.
It's like, it's like. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_06> - Goku, every time it
dies, just gets stronger. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Man. Like every time they die. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, go going on a complete tangent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't, I never realized how
Opie of an ability that is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Imagine like coming close to
death and then coming back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then powering up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> by simply getting the
kicked out of you. (laughs) </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Sorry that's I've just, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I'm just going on a complete tangent. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> That's like completely broken ability </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> and no wonder no one's ever called that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Who would you say if we're
talking about brand recognition </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> who would you say is
the most recognizable, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> like animated character
or animate franchise? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Not including Pokemon </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, can you tell me
what you're going to? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's still pretty
depressive there for a game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> For a. - Game. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The most recognizable anime figure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, like if the moment
someone says the word anime, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who is, what is the
first thing you think of? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - I have different answers
depending on maybe where </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> in the world I manage a vendor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> I'm on derive on basically
Asia in the entire world. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> I want to say. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But if you don't include Pokémon, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because Pokémon is
originally a game, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Is it draggable Rosie, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> would you think Goku? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh cool probably it might be go Goku. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - The question is draggable
fans who can be Goku </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> Can everyone be cokers? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_10> We're literally asking you a
question, but can they be Coke? </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_02> Can they be loofy man? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I Would say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I Yuki you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone knows that Hab and
people with maybe know Yogi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_10> They don't know what the he is though. </SPEAKER_10>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would argue maybe narrative is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't have the narrative.
Doesn't have the legacy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> Right. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's pretty yoke here. If it's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if we're not counting Pokémon. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We're not doing G J P only. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> It always surprises me how
popular bleach was and still is. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Right. Cause like it's only, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> it's only recently that I've
realized how popular it is. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sir. I don't know anything about bleach. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What I know is that every time someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has an edge Lord on
Twitter, they like bleach. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> Is that, is that a
coincidence or was that like. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - No, definitely. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Not. No. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just wondering. Cause
every time they are, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they have a bleach profile picture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> - That that makes it seem
the character designs. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - It's like edge. Yeah. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_09> But I was like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> I kind of singled out and
made me not want to watch the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - Nah, I would, I would
argue that like as, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> as someone who was a massive
bleach fan, like it's, don't, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_11> don't let that blind you
because it's a great show up to </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> also important. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - I mean I knew that there was
a huge following for bleach, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> but I didn't like, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I didn't recognize how big
the falling was. I mean, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> for the longest time it was like, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> it was bigger than one
piece worldwide, I think. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And it's not just like, well, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> just like a bit bigger than one piece. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> It was like it was like
massively bigger than one piece. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And I guess that kind of makes sense </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> because one piece didn't
have the greatest launch. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Well, I think like during
the, the postdoc, the, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> - Well, I think like during
the, the postdoc, the, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I think like every week in
shunting job bleach was just </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> number one, actually the longest. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - Can you search up the most
successful anime franchises? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Because I think bleachers
like up there on the list, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> I think, I think that's what surprised me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> Yeah. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you see the, sorry? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you see the one piece
slash Mario figure collab? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What I like Mario was like
drawn in like one piece style, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he looks like a pirate do
type in a one piece. Mario. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> Why have I not like a $200
figure and it looks insane. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> It looked right up your alley Jerry. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - One way. What is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - The one piece? One piece
Mario figure. Google it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Are you, there you go. </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_01> Leech that's number 16, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 15, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_11> 14, </SPEAKER_11>

<SPEAKER_03> - That's shocking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's that? </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> is going to make it sound so boring. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It follows the life of a police officer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the community district
of Tokyo. Oh, that's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> Wow. Wow. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And it was a franchise
that went on for 50 years </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_11> and the author is famous for
never taking a break. Oh. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - 50, 50 years. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - 200, 200 volumes. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Eva. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> You go seven. That makes sense. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Yeah, one piece of number six left. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Yeah. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Yeah. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_01> That makes sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_11> Fourth has Gundam dragon
ball, dragon ball. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Make sense? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_01> Wow. Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - You can nothing beats Pokémon. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Number two, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like the fist
of the north star one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's an anomaly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I feel like that's cheating
because how much of that is just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how much of that is not
Gacha what's what's the GENCO </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Pachinko. How much, how
much of that revenue is? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> A lot of the anime franchises
Eva's done at has done it. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> They license out that the anime to. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm like, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> you got your old people
who grew up on fish, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> the north star where they're
going to spend the money on. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> So chinchona my. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Uncle got into PHIS, the
north star and Eva, because. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> - They exactly right. Exactly. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - You ever see that Mario party thing? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> There's very few arcades habit. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like a gambling Mario
party game in the casino. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you see other casino in the arcade, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes you seen that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_11> it's like pay money to move on the board. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Hey, money to move. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - On the board. You pay money
to move around this book. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> It's really weird. And there's one, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> there was one in the arcade
and next to the two host cinema </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> and Shinjuku. Okay. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> That, okay, it's gone now. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Oh. But it used to be one there. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> And it was. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - Is that the building
that the VR puck was. In? </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> No, no, no. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> That's maybe it, maybe it
is actually there anymore. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So they used to have like
this Mario party game </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where you'd have to put money into like, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> get like gamble a little bit
weird and then you would move </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> forward and you could win.
I think you could win money. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Okay, it's really weird. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah, it's really weird. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's very jarring scenario. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> No, it was legal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I think it was, it was intended license. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Okay. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I think sometimes everyone
wants to tell her it'd be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the company is like super good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No cause it's like, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> With a fist and the Wolf
stop Pachinko. That, that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that makes a lot of sense
because it's Pachinko </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> makes a ton of money in
Japan and that's why, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why Konami sold
out to become a Pachinko. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause he shouldn't go in mobile games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like all the coolest
looking buildings in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are just put. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - If a building looks
clean and it looks amazing </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and it looks fascinating it's Pachinko. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - There's a Pachinko parlor in Yokohama. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> That's literally shaped like an Eva. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_12> Yeah and it's like, and I'm
like, that is a cool building. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> What is that? Always pitching. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Yeah, whenever I see a
building of bright lights, cool. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> Anime characters slapped
on everywhere. I'm like, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a cool looking anime
store, Pachinko every time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the door. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Opens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> It's this. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - It's so depressing. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> think about Japan. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Everyone's addicted to
shooting these balls into. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - You could be like in the
middle of the countryside, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> but there'll be one cool
building, it'll be the Pachinko. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I mean the biggest building. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You know, there'll be
like these rundown houses, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like the economy is like depleted
and then there'll be this, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like a gypsy tomb level
of like, like intensity. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_11> It's massive, well lit up </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_02> like there's rice fields all around it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's Pachinko. It's five floors. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> It's insane. It's actually insane. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - The other fields they
could have put this thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> into so many other different buildings. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> Some yet like maybe make like
escape room or something or, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, maybe it's just a cool store. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Arcade, no Pachinko, every tire. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause that's the that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_11> - Makes money. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> - I don't get it. I mean,
we did the Pachinko. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_07> - Just the most boring and
miserable type of gambling </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_11> I've ever experienced in my life. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> Like at least what I lose in
like blackjack or something. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I'm like, oh, Ooh, Ooh. </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> I'm not, I'm not condoning blackjack, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> but like just shooting a bowl
and just watching it go in </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_08> and then just like
holding it for 10 minutes. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Happening half the
time, it's like, I think, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think I'm winning. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_12> - I'm pretty sure like 90% of his orangy. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> And it's just like, </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> gameplay is just do I hold this? </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_00> Do I hold this Pachinko at
a 90 degree angle or 91? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you asked the people it's not orangy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but also they also, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they like scout out machines
to see which ones have paid out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_11> so people will like, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_11> people will get that like
right before it opens and wait, </SPEAKER_11>
<SPEAKER_09> like wait for like hours </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> just so they can get the one machine </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_12> that's gonna pay out. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think it was a cool to do
as like a one-time experience. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> But then I can't imagine how
people spend hours there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_12> - It's depressing, it stinks of smoke. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> It's shit, it's so loud. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> You can't, they can't do anything. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> It's so shit. </SPEAKER_12>
<SPEAKER_12> - Yeah, I'd rather get a hobby, honestly. </SPEAKER_12>
