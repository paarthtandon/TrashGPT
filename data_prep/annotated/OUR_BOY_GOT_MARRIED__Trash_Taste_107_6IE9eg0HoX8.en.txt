<SPEAKER_03> yeah double clutch like ladybird did but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh yeah we've uh made it to los angeles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> um and we've somehow found like been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> able to build a studio despite a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> issues oh that's we're gonna get into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that very quickly um i'm sure the the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> rounds have already </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> been made of the actual situation yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the rounds have already been the rains </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> people online if you've been on reddit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe you're aware of this uh if not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> which i'm like a big portion of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> audience isn't uh the subreddit yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> our baggage con containing melin said it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was thirty thousand dollars worth of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> equipment it's actually i think closer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to fifty thousand yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah closer to fifty thousand worth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dollars worth of filming equipment all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> our mics all our cameras uh were lost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the way here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh at this point at this moment we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> still don't know where they are yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so we had to like scramble to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all of this equipment so that we can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually film some episodes and you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially because we're going to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> guests on eventually as well yeah from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> next episode yeah so uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just stressful as [ __ ] this was not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the start that we wanted i'm so thankful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we scheduled in like two three free </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> days of just like no guess no filming </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> anything yeah uh because if we if we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> thought that we were gonna hit the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> ground running we would have been [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like i guess literally arrives and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like so where's the set like uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> about that yeah it doesn't exist yet do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you want to explain your process of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> going to okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i was in charge of bringing all of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the equipment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh to america because these boys flew a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bit early uh so i get to heathrow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> airport terminal 2 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i already like already alarm bells </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are ringing because i get there and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> want to check in and i can't check in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i hear one of the operators say oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no we can't check anyone in right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there is a queue downstairs of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about 200 bags and no one can check in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right now so i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's uh that's that's that's pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bad that's that's that's a lot that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that's like a bad omen right there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's worrying yeah so i arrive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know an hour no two hours before my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flights as like that's what they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recommend so i have to wait an hour just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to check in my backs just checking my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bags right uh and that's true for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty much everyone on the plane so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> check in my bags an hour before our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> flight and then i check in my normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bags and then i have we have two massive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pelican cases containing all of our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> filming equipment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and um they look at that and they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we can't check that in here you're gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> have to go to the oversized luggage like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> section i'm like okay i'm like oh no oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no this is this is this is this is scary </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> already i'm like my spidey senses were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tingling yeah you know i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> something is going to go wrong </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so i bring over the two pelican cases </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> over to the oversized luggage uh place </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and uh so there's an operator there and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you could tell like this operator just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] done he did he he does not give </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> him you're dealing with this for a few </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> days yeah yeah yeah he does not give a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] at all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then he looks at the cases and he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all right just just put them put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them on there put them on the conveyor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> belt and i'll get it through the system </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then he i put it on the conveyor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> belt he presses a button to open a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shutter to get it through the airport </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the shutter doesn't open and here he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> presses again doesn't open and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay uh there's something weird going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here is this a mouth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like malfunction or something and he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just he sits there he sits down and he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sits there for five minutes doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> nothing doing like like doing nothing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right he just sits there for five </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> minutes and i'd like even like pretend </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> to work yeah he just doesn't even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretend to work he just sits down and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like plays on his phone and then like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> while i'm waiting a queue starts to form </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> behind me first it's like one person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then it's two people then it's three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people and like it it really starts to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> build up right and so after about 10 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes of just sitting down doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nothing the guy just like tries to press </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't work and then he finally he like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> phones he like tries to phone somebody </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he tries to do something about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> um and so he phones the operator in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> charge of whoever is in charge of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> baggage uh and uh he says oh the shutter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> won't open and then they say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh yeah we're not letting any bags in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now because we are just completely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> full like we cannot take any more bags </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into our system right and so i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> waiting for about like 20 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh and so you know i was waiting in this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> queue for about 20 minutes before he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> presses the button and the shutter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> finally opens and like right the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bags finally went through and i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by the time my bags went through it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> half an hour before my flight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and like i remember thinking finally the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shutters open bag goes through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then the shutter closed and there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just this moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm never gonna see them again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i had i had a feeling i had a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> feeling self-fulfilling prophecy yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah i had like a [ __ ] vision it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> closed and i'm just like okay i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i have a bad feeling about this like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] obi-wan and um i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> texting the group being like uh guys not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be alarmed but i'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's there's a good chance that maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we won't get to see our equipment but i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like hoping out of hope </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so you know i check in we go through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh so we i flew air lingus so the air </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> lingus flight goes from dublin so it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> goes from heathrow to dublin and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dublin to america lax </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so uh the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> flight from dublin that's the flight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from heathrow to dublin was actually on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time which i think that's the reason our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bags didn't get delivered because it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on time and we woke up the next day and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we found out that there's there's an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> image on screen with all of the bags </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that are like stuck in heathrow terminal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 2 now it's like a [ __ ] it's a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sea of bags right our bag is somewhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in there at this point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um but then after that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> uh i check into my second flight to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to america </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we all check in i'm sitting in my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seat and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's you know you know where you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> some of those flights where for some </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> reason the plane just doesn't move yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> right right so i we were sitting there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for like a full-on hour right so like we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> were sitting there for a full an hour </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> trying to figure out what's going on you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know are we actually going to take off </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then after an hour like the operator </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> comes in and we and was like guys i know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you've been waiting a while uh that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because there's been a massive queue on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the runway right now uh so we're gonna </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> be a bit delayed and i'm gonna be real </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with you uh it's looking like that we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna be sitting here for another two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know when like bad news gets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> announced and you just feel the air just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drop yeah yeah yeah like like there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that [ __ ] grown noise that just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> distributed throughout the entire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] plane right and everyone's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so we we all start getting our phones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything like that and uh you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i you know i was thankful because i got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to catch up with [ __ ] spy family you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what i did with my extra two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> hours on the tarmac but after worse yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it could be worse but like after being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> delayed for three hours on the tarmac </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> finally i get to go to lax right you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know [ __ ] wow [ __ ] [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> brilliant i finally i finally get to go </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> my flight to america the flight itself </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was very very pleasant you know um you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know we had some very good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> what they called air stewardesses there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know service yeah service we had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very good service uh the flight itself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was great but then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the nightmare continued when i landed in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> lax right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that's just any landing in lao yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah the nightmare continues yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i get i i get down and i thought that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had saved time because if you fly from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dublin to america we have pre-clearance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so we don't like if you fly from dublin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't actually need to go through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> immigration in america that's very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] good yeah you can go through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> immigration in dublin yeah so it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> treated as a domestic flight so i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> great i could just pick my bags and get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the [ __ ] out of there yeah and so i walk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for what feels like 20 minutes to get to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my baggage collection right yeah we all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> have to do that yeah yeah yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by the time i get there our bags aren't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even on the carousel because they are so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> busy that they are still </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the people from the previous </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> flights are still getting their bags </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> from this carousel because there's only </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> one carousel in the domestic terminal </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah so we that we like people from </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> hawaii were still like which was the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> flight before we're still waiting for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> their bags to come out so we couldn't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> get our bags before the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> passengers from hawaii could completely </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> get their bags out so i was waiting for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> about an hour </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> before we even got any of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> any bags from our flights to come out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after our after our bags after their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bags finished getting uh collected </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> finally our bags come out and it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's like a drip feed i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how i don't know how it was such a slow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drip feed would like were they like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] cycling it over like one bag at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> a time because i was like dragging it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> over the whole </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> journey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was coming out like [ __ ] five bags </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at a time like it's so by the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> by the time like i got some of my bags </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> after that i have to queue again with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the with these 20 30 people all trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like wave their [ __ ] tickets to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like uh like pick a form up and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it was like my first reminder about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what i can experience here in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> terms of customer service because i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> used to japanese customer service </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah i i'm very blessed with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japanese customer service where they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> felt like you know they will do anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they can to help you or at least they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they will like at least pretend to give </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you [ __ ] yeah right yeah like at lax </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> like i've had two instances now where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there is not even any pretending to give </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a [ __ ] about the customer at all like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like if anything i felt guilty for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> having to trouble them for an issue with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the [ __ ] airport you know so like i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> guess so like i had to like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> fight my way through to like give them </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the ticket and this guy punching my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> numbers in uh to this lost and found </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> form just could not give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he could he like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he like he didn't give a [ __ ] so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it ended up we found out later that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he'd punched in the wrong numbers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to this form </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so it was like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was this experience of everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that could go wrong with a flight did go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wrong and it turned a already long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> travel time from england to america and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> added around five to six hours on top of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm so sorry yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> she's staying here yeah there's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> this they're saying it and uh yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's what that at this moment in time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that's all we know about what's happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to our bags i think it's still in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> heathrow um if i'm gonna guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hopefully we can hopefully get our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> equipment back like what happens if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're like oh by the way we delivered </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> it to lax like a month later and i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like we're not in here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah i don't know what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] is happening yeah yeah it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> frustrating it's like i wish they would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tell you anything yeah i think it's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fact that they don't they like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like the airline leaves you completely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the dark and doesn't tell you hey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's here it hasn't been shipped out yet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's all backed up yeah okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> well i could somewhat understand that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but when they just [ __ ] tell you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> nothing yeah they're like oh no it's an </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> lax yeah and like like they because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> meleen was calling them up and being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very angry yeah good good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good mailing uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they told meleen that like hey yeah the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> bags have been at lax since june 16th </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and then he goes to lax again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to try and get there and so i [ __ ] so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they told us that the bags had been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> delivered to lax so i was just like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to go there physically to pick them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up yeah right because we've got 50 000 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of equipment i don't want to risk like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasting any more time so i drive to lax </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and of course driving to lax is a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] nightmare in la because you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like [ __ ] because you have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> drive in l.a yeah yeah yeah so it takes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> us about 40 minutes to get to lax and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then i go to the section where they told </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me to pick the bags up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i had my second experience with uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lax customer service right which was uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i tried to explain that i have tickets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to pick up my bags um and so the woman </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in charge just goes no no we don't have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any bags from air lingus right now and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what she says and then she goes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> away she doesn't even give me time to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like explain my situation she's just she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just [ __ ] off and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> to the other side of the room and starts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like picking up and messing around with </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> up needing a service about needing a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> service it just it just made me like she </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> made me feel guilty for even like trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to explain the situation and trying to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> find out more information </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um after driving there for 40 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she goes in she checks the details </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the [ __ ] luggage tag and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything and then she comes back and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she's just like there is no bags here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your bags have not been delivered i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know what the airline have told </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you they've pretty much just said uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they've pretty much just said something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> false because we've had no bags from the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> airline at all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that like that like almost broke me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that like almost broke me right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because after driving there for 40 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes not getting my bags after being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> delayed for fight like after wasting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> five hours of my time the day before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i i now had to drive back from lax </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to our studio and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like for some reason god just hated me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on that day because the traffic back was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like way worse than the traffic there so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it took twice the amount of time to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drive back and it was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ah like i couldn't get it done oh man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that like that drove my monk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> experience to its limit because i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i was like up to here i was about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to [ __ ] explode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm surprised you didn't explode i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> anyone else would have [ __ ] exploded </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> long before yeah i was like i would have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> certainly exploded internally i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> screaming because like i like i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to scream at like you know i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to be like the karen to like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> customer service manager but like i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they just situations like that where i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's almost a necessity to be a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> character well no because like right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i didn't want to make i didn't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like like bring out my frustration on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the person right but also that person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> was i felt bringing out her frustrations </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on me right my customer with maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> previous customers she's had and i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> just like it just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> it was just awful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it was an awful experience there's no </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's no there's no silver lining in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this it was just an awful experience and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's still not resolved um yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it wasn't the best first experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh touching touching down in america but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh yeah come to america wow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> welcome to america right what do you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> mean you didn't tip your bag handler at </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the airport </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you know give him a 20 tip on his salary </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> to get your bag delivered we [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talk about that because that's that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> one frustration i've had since getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here right so it's like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously because we had lost our [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and it still hasn't been resolved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had to figure out ways to get the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> equipment right so it's like we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> calling up camera play camera rental </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> places we're calling up light rental </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> places yeah all that kind of stuff and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then we realized oh there's no uh mic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stands right because we're usually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> attached to a table right but wait like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not going to work with you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the current set we're in right now so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're like alright [ __ ] we got to buy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> some mic stands so i'm like all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'll just get some on amazon you know go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on to amazon blah blah blah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i think again this is where we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> blessed with amazon japan standards yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is it is very rare to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something on amazon no matter how small </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or large how cheap or expensive it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and usually 99 times out of 100 you'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get it the next day yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> next day delivery that's just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> normal yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> so i thought </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it would be the same here yeah they do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have next day delivery if you would like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to pay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 500 more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for shipping yeah and like i looked at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it and i was like hold on how does that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> work so i get free shipping if it comes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like three days from now yeah but if i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want it tomorrow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i basically have to tip amazon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 10 15 more yeah to get it the next day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's about 10 15 delivery uh if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> want to get your stuff the next day yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> which i'm i'm of we're obviously blessed </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with amazon uk amazon japan which it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> comes free with prime you get next day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> delivery yeah and like you know i like i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> would i would understand maybe if uh if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was kind of like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> one thing that surprised me because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thought you know [ __ ] amazon started </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in california right yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so so can we fact check that at least </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> because i i don't know amazon yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> it was it's uh seattle is this yeah oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah okay okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's american yeah okay okay okay just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> fine ignore that that's that's that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just i made it the [ __ ] up moment yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah okay seattle but i would think that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> with la being one of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] major cities in america </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right because like you get perks if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> order from say london in the uk i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought with la with this being like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know hollywood and needing a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> equipment a lot of shipment and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything like that i thought that they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would have a service that is more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> convenient </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and i yeah i was very surprised to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see that you can't get the same level of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> convenience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> uh just by being in l.a you literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> have to pay to win yeah it's it's hard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> right there's a lot of like uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> socio-economic factors involved right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i mean already right like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> next day shipping you don't really need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> next-door shipping like when do you how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> often do you need next-day shipping all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the time no never normally no i do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> because i i usually when i have to buy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> something on amazon it's when i need it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> urgently yeah and i don't have enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> time to go to the shops to get it or i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> or perhaps it's something that i can't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get like an example just give me an </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> example </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> well say for example like camera </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> equipment in japan right isn't that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right it's very rare that you can go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a big enough like yoda bash your big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> camera that has the exact specifics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah well you know sometimes there are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> some brands for example that you can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> easily access in japanese but like i i'd </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> say it's very rare that you need 100 you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> need this next day like i bet 90 of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you ordered on amazon you did you did </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> not need that next day i'm sure yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the convenience is there right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's there i think it's it's good to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have that convenience but i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially in america cause it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like so inefficient </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and like you know everything is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> delivered by roads like have you seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the videos of like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> freight trains at the liver stuff in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like california yeah i have to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> break it open yeah yeah they get robbed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the [ __ ] time yeah wow i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think because the infrastructure just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't there and then the next day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> delivery that they do do is almost like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it like [ __ ] up the like the people who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to actually deliver it because they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to do these insane routes right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> trying to deliver this and they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pissing in bottles and [ __ ] so part of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> me is like yeah i love next day delivery </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but i feel like just in america it just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> doesn't it's not feasible it's not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> feasible and if you are doing it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something bad is happening to someone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who is yeah i guess this is definitely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like me being privileged it's definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> awesome it's definitely pretty much i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just wanted to talk about it because i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah it's a complicated thing and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean there's a bigger underlying issue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> to it you know japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for some reason people don't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about being worked like crazy for like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> nine hours and being superficial </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't know why in the uk you get next </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> day delivery as well you do but in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> london it's it seems like it's it would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> make way more sense to have that work in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> london but like in wales you don't have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that oh you don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> not really like i lived right next to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the amazon warehouse in swansea and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was never next day delivery really i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> live next to the warehouse right for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whole area </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> uh it's just i don't know london it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> makes more sense it's possible there's a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> lot more like curious is there maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a sense of urgency towards like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fulfilling customer like requests maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like i i assume in wales not a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of people are like ordering from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> amazon right sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> surely in cardiff right maybe in cardiff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah but like i think all the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> card afforders are being filled </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fulfilled by the swansea yeah right it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> about an hour yeah because like i guess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> that's what i thought where i would </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> understand if you lived like in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] boonies like in the middle of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nowhere okay you're not gonna get to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> next day delivery but like if you live </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in america this is l.a yeah this is this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> is l.a you can get it but like i it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> only certain items right because it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> got to be fulfilled by amazon which </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> means it's in their warehouse already </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then they get one of their couriers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to come and get it and that makes more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> sense but i don't know the whole [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> system here is weird and even in europe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like not as good as japan japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah works just but japan's had like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like an amazing shipping network for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like forever yeah like they've they've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they've got to figure it out yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> everything like that's what they care </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> about yeah that's like there like and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> not a single tip was necessary yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because people yeah because people here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> they're like bro we've got like so many </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> issues like guns and then japan's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that if that [ __ ] package </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't [ __ ] turn up when i tell it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to i'm not voting for you yeah that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like legit that's what they give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> about it we've only been here like a few </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> days and like within that few days we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like we can feel like an entire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> complaining about america like like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is just the complaining about america </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> episode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah because it's just this endless </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] stream because like well care is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like an endless loop of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dichotomy is like okay oh this big </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> company does bad thing but it's like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> reason why it's doing bad thing is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because people don't want to do anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> else and yeah it's just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i get it to a point why why i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experienced such bad customer service </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's because they have no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] incentive to give a [ __ ] about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their job right and you know i get it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i've i've especially dealing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with people at the airport you deal with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the most stressed out people in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> world right you know at you know at a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> level i get it you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um and it's kind of sad in a way where i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> see a lot of people in customer service </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh positions and you and it feels like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the only people that you see actually </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> care about giving a good service is when </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there is an option to tip in the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> occupation yeah right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's true yeah i mean i mean that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's that's just what i've seen like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if like there is there are plenty of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> customer service positions in america </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> but only the ones that tip i've with my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> own experience is the ones where you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really feel that they care about the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> customer right right and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> society right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we live in a society society </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i'd love to say that man yeah dude i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> would do different yeah i i would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> totally care yeah i don't think i'd care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> no no no well no no i'd be like i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] care like why would i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you know it's on my back well especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're surrounded by that environment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right it's like you'd look like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> weirdo if you're the one that's caring </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm i'm sure at lax that woman has </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> probably had the most horrible people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah shouting at her yeah i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> screaming and then no repercussions yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the guy [ __ ] walks off goes home he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i did nothing wrong yeah you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know yeah yeah yeah i i totally get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's it sucks though but it does </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> suck and you're like why don't you on me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> i was nice to you yeah yeah yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it sucks for me because like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> happen to be the person that all that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] frustration got taken out of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it just felt [ __ ] horrible just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not to be given the time of day or just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> to be like made to feel guilty for just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to like resolve one issue in my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> end even in the uk that's pretty rare </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah they happen often the i feel like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a level of disappointment and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> resentment that everyone has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it doesn't really yeah yeah it doesn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> really go below that everyone kind of is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> just kind of like yeah all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because i feel like in the uk you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> can really just like look i'm going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> through a [ __ ] day right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a certain tone where you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially in this kind of situations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where i feel like it's much rarer in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uk from what i've seen to like see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people really have like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> outburst you know what i mean i mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that they were that they're all planning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> i've seen playing it will definitely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> happen yeah but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's less than what i've seen you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> here in america at least okay i just i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just needed to vent a bit okay because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally like lost about like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> encountering about like eight hours of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my time to this i mean like when it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it's lax it's like triple it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah yeah you you you gave eight </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> but you lost twenty times yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> move slowly i feel like i lost like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> year of my life with this with this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> experience you know i mean i'd be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> miserable if i worked at lax yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> miserable going through lax let alone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> working out people people are like bro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> these are not newark i'm like you're not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] any better like what are you on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> about like you all suck it's all this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all broken none of this works </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so actually because like this like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we've been to la before but i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think this is like the first time we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had like extended stay in l.a right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the longest time i've been in la like in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one goes maybe like five days yeah at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> most yeah and that's always been in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> downtown yeah right and every time i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talk to a local they're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> downtown really yeah that's like that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like that's like the awful it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty sick yeah that's the sketch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> sector </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll get stabbed or shots uh if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> walk down the streets there which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something we've definitely come close to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experiencing in downtown l.a around ax </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like the reason we normally come to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> la is because of ax and ax is in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> downtown l.a so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um so this is actually our first like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience mostly like outside of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> downtown but also getting a chance to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know experience actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> explore los angeles yeah yeah so you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> guys were like here a few days before me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> how was how was your guys's experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well it was good until i got covered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's true </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean it was good for like the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three or four days because i was staying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in pasadena yeah which is like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> relatively nicer part of l.a everyone in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> la says it's a nice part of l.a it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nice to be fair yeah um and then you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> have like you know places like glendale </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which is next door which is where all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the youtubers live yeah um and stuff and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like i definitely saw like a more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like relaxed and more i guess like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> felt safer in pasadena and glendale </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right a million times more than in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> downtown l.a yeah which is not hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because downtown la is just gta in real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> life right so it's like you know i felt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot safer and i was like okay i can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually like kind of walk the streets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of pasadena during the day yeah and it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feels just like a regular town it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of nice and there's like lots of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> places to eat and it's like really chill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah um just look like drake and josh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> when i realized that yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i felt like i was on an episode of drake </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and josh a little bit yeah i like walked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> past like like an elementary school that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looked like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it was ripped straight from the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> simpsons and i was like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it was like that was like okay you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know that it was that point where i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like okay you know what l.a might </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> not be as bad yeah and then again there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was just those like just small little </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> instances </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that just made me be like um yeah maybe </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> not maybe right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like say the [ __ ] lax situation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like you know the amazon situation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like it's it's very nitpicky i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know yeah but i think it just goes to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> show how much we've been blessed in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tokyo i mean like it's it's nitpicky but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it's when you choose for like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a place to live for example like place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> visiting and living is like two totally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different experiences but like it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of like little things that will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> build up over time of course you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's you know one thing i've really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really missed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is walking yeah i've missed walking a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot and you know i'm sure like there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are some places in in la which i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i'm sure you can walk you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like i feel like a lot of america as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a whole is just not built for walking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's all right because i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was i was meeting up with a friend of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> mine uh and she she just lives she lives </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like kind of uh in the middle between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pasadena and glendale so like from my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hotel it was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 20 minute walk yeah right at most yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so i was like we were hanging in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pasadena we had lunch and [ __ ] and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like oh let's just go back to your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> place and we'll just hang out yeah and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looked on the map and it was like 20 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes i'm like yeah we can walk that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a nice day [ __ ] it's the middle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the day it's like what 2 p.m yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> afternoon i kind of want to have a walk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she was like she looked at me like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was a [ __ ] weirdo she was like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are you homeless yeah it's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> walking what the [ __ ] this is like we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna walk it and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't [ __ ] look at me like that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yes i would like to use my legs because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i haven't done that in a while since i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh and she was just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know kind of thing and she kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of reluctantly followed me yeah um i got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like five minutes into this walk yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and i turned a corner and i was like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't want to go down there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like okay i can see what you were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> talking about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yes it's a 20 minute walk but it's also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 20 minutes of my life potentially in a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of danger at the same time you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it's 30 minutes when you've got to do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the navy seals checks and all that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you've got to dodge all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> homeless people yeah but it's uh yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know even it could be like i felt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel weird catching an uber to some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> place that's like five minutes away yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> but it's you have to right living here </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and i think that's like one thing that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> made me realize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know perhaps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> la is fun to visit but definitely i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wouldn't want to live here yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> personally speaking i don't know when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's like four lanes of like cars </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like crossing it just feels like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] dice roll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's like a lot of them don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have light so i'm like wait so when do i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go it's just like no no you play chicken </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you cross the first two yeah and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you kind of wait in the middle literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the moment you step out of the car you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> are playing with your life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you're just playing frogger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah i mean it gets pretty [ __ ] scary </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> especially like especially when you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in downtown la or like any like sketch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> places right which there are a number of </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_07> i mean we wanted everyone to have a good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> time like oh no wonder that tab was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> high but that wasn't even on the tab </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that was like a free package that we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> paid for i remember i remember i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like i went up to the bar after like my </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> well i just drank like three of them and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i was just [ __ ] shaking yeah so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guess like to go to like the start of my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> experience with the wedding because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously you guys experience was very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very different from mine yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so like um so we had like about i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> think it was only like 62 people at this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wedding so it's like a fairly small </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wedding but like i really really like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the size of the wedding because it was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good amount of size i could keep up with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like pretty much you could interact with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone i could talk with everyone and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not feel like it was just like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> convention experience where i was having </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like one sentence conversation with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people would like have proper meaningful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> conversations which is which is good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i just wanted to like i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wanted to just like share the good vibes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um but i remember like the night before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the wedding i was so [ __ ] i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know i don't know what the right word to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> describe it was it was like a mixture of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like nervous and excited because like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was it was not like the bad kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nervous like the way i described it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it kind of felt like you were 10 years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> old and it was the day before christmas </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> like two hours of sleep before my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wedding for the day for my wedding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i thought because i i tried to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to sleep at a reasonable time so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was going to go to sleep at around 11 00 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like i'm like great i'm gonna have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reasonable amount of sleep before my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wedding can be well rested and then like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> an hour passes all right five hours of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sleep now that's how it always works now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'll just like if if i if i just go </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> something yeah it's just like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> this big thing is coming up but you just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gotta wait around yeah for it to start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the worst yeah it's it's i was i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was so i was so [ __ ] jittery </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i know yeah like because i talked to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sydney if she was nervous for the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wedding and she was like her nerves like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ended the moment she woke up because she </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like so busy like before the wedding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> started because she had to like go do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> her makeup go do her hair and like all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the bridesmaids as well so she was at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> venue from like 9am oh wow and i didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't need to get there until 12 00 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 12 00 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to 12 noon yeah the easy job yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so like that that was just like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of time for just me to like be alone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with my own thoughts and be really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> really [ __ ] nervous um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so yeah i was i was really tense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nervous whatever but luckily luckily i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had i had my i had my boys with me i had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my boys were there the lads were there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my hype men you know whether they were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there with me um and i remember i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to the boys um so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to fully explain neither of these two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were my best men uh it's it's okay so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm sorry i'm sorry guys and only conor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was a groomsman but like part of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reason was like it made me realize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> how long it's been since i've planned </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this wedding because we had we like me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and cindy had planned the wedding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically like before we had moved to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and yeah and like every like air like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every role or like the entire wedding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> party was chosen and everything um yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was like it was like going the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wedding was going to originally be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before trash tastes even started yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like [ __ ] insane that like i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> grown so much closer to these two in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like these past two years where like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> when my wedding was planned i like i i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> knew joey but we hung out only like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> few times you know and we'd hang out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like a lot but i was like not as close </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to you as i am now so so it was like it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was so weird to like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was so weird to have a wedding that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> was planned two years ago where like now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the dynamic is like totally [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different and everything i was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saying like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so like i remember like we call everyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in to the main ceremony hall uh so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone starts getting their seats </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like i call like i'm like i go out i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go out by myself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i'm like gone you got this you got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this go on this is you're gonna you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna do a no-tier wedding run there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> going to be zero crying at this wedding </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like i got to myself just to give </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> myself like a breather and like i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay i bring out like we have me and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sydney had personal vows so i bring out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my personal vows and i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> rehearsing them in my head i'm like okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you got this this is zero tears we're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not going to cry this morning we got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this you got this i read like the first </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> sentence and i just like started like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my jaw my jaw just starts going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'm like oh no oh no this is a bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sign this is a bad sign and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> while i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> while i'm doing this like all of my all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my lads all my groomsmen come out and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they see me and i'm like guys i'm gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> need some hype around me i'm i'm i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna need some [ __ ] hype around me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like this was a step this was the moment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where i took a page out of connor's book </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm like i literally go full monkey mode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right outside the ceremony it works dude </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it works i was like i was like </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_07> this the shouting type you offer people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> who haven't tried it if you tried it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually yeah you fully commit to it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it works yeah i mean like that time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it really [ __ ] worked because i had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so much adrenaline in my body yeah that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh that i needed some way to uh i need i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> needed some way to release it yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so i remember getting to the ceremony </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> room and i'm like okay it's good the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shouting helps i'm like i'm like i'm </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> nervous that made everyone else in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> room nervous right being like oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah which like i knew it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> coming because like i remember it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> literally the day that miura passed away </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right and i remember you know we were </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we're at netflix shoot at the day so i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> didn't have like properly proper time to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like process that news </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> and i remember that day i went back home </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i put on gus's theme and i was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like just like zoning out together this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing [ __ ] crying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the news that i just got announced </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know sydney also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cindy was also listening to it just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> listening to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh seeing me listen to it for hours yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she's just like i [ __ ] [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> love this song you know yeah because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like it's like to me gus's theme is like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> by far like one of one of the greatest </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> tracks in anime to like to like ever to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like ever be made you know it's it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> such a like a beautiful track and you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know it's unfortunate that it's been </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> memed a lot nowadays so that's that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like that's like a lot of that's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how people perceive guts's theme but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> i remembered listening to that on that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> day that it's just such a beautiful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] track gorgeous yeah and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] cried to it so many times and so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember sydney goes to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> jokingly she turns to me and she was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> wouldn't it be funny if we walked down </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the aisle to this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and i was just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah that'd be funny </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then we both turned to each other </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and and we looked at each other in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> eyes and we're just like but what if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> what are you going to do the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> default music yeah yeah yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then like we we like we're like would it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be would it be cheesy i thought it would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it would be cheesy and so we let it we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let it sink for a while and like we let </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> it sit for a few days we let it sit for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a few weeks and then like the longer </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the longer like we sat in it the more it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> felt like it was just the right idea </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because like i [ __ ] knew that i was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> going to cry listening to gus's theme </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> walking like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like i'm sure like people knew we were </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> going to play gus's theme that would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> have taken like the [ __ ] guts this thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you know i i i wish i knew </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> beforehand yeah yeah yeah because i feel </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was for me it was like the initial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> really yeah it was like that moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right it's like wow they're actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> using godzilla's thing right yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> there was a split second where i i was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> about to start laughing yeah but then i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> was like but then again seeing you and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> then seeing sydney i was just like nah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this is like this this is the right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> choice yeah yeah yeah because it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i remember sydney was telling me that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know before sydney comes out all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> bridesmaids walk out yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if if you are familiar with guts's theme </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> there's like the intro bit and then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like the voice there's the voice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> of the guy going </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and i remember thinking i see all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bridesmaids walk out and i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where's sydney where's sydney </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and as soon as like the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> comes up she's she just appears right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and apparently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> behind the scenes like like sydney's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like with her dad waiting to walk out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and her dad's like come on it's time to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> go and she's like no i need to wait for </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_06> [Music] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah because like the dance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> floor was kind of weird because it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like there was either no one there or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone was there yeah there was no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in-between so it was during the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it was like me dean like a couple </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of other people and we just you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like a couple of tracks playing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then and then the calgary summer </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> well we gotta dance to this all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like we're gonna pop off to this one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah and so i just stopped </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> popping off because i was stupidly drunk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not realizing someone is behind me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> filming this entire ordeal right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so when i received the video i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> wow i'm [ __ ] right now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm so [ __ ] because i never danced </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah right because i can't dance for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] yeah i was i was dancing like my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> life was [ __ ] depending on it yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you went again when uh dev </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> manoj started playing again i started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> playing i was like all right all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ty is coming off i'm popping off today </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because i remember we went in waves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because everyone went on the dance floor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then everyone was like let's get a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drink and then everyone immediately went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the bar and it just it just kept </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coming in waves but i remember like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the time when everyone started to pop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> off was when [ __ ] september played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's and that's when that's when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the video like me and joey [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> hugging yeah um came about but like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember before that i remember i like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gave conor that conor the hug as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it was like [ __ ] september </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everyone was so hyped and i was that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was like i think like the hyper song i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know why it was september </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because i like because i thought it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just like it's a happy song and also </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like every time we used to go to karaoke </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> together yeah that song was always the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> best oh yeah yeah yeah so that's where i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought it was yeah yeah yeah yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i would say like if okay so one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> i think one of the best decisions i made </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with my wedding if you are whatever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> planning advice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> here's some wedding advice um if you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> ever planning uh if you're planning a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> future wedding or something so like even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> though there was only 62 people at my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> wedding which is a fairly small wedding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my eyes smaller yeah yeah smaller </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wedding like wedding fomo is a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> thing because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i wanted to be with everyone at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> times i wanted to see what was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> popping off what people were talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> about i just wanted to see what's going </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on because like because there's only one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of me and because there's like only so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> much so many hours in this one [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> day you can only be at one place at a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time and it's like i had so many regrets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um because we're also like really really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] busy with the photographers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting like our own wedding photos or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something like one thing i big one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably my biggest figure of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wedding is that i didn't see everyone's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> reaction to the postcards and all the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> messages and stuff because we were like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> should have all filmed your reaction so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i can react to it later yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so because we were outside taking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wedding photography uh when you guys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> were in so like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> one of the best decisions i made is that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i had we had like a gopro there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> uh because of course we did i learned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> from trash tastes right i i learned from </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> trash taste of course and i was just i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> went to like everyone and i was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like film whatever you want just just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just film whatever you want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i've seen the footage and i'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it gives you like such an on the ground </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> experience to what everyone was doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like we haven't we had videographers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there and so i'm very very excited to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see what they captured on their end but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think it's just like it was like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was a totally different view when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just had people filming their own povs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on gopros right um because like you got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to see like the progression everyone was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like so well spoken so happy at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> beginning of the wedding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you go to like the end footage </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it was like a guy [ __ ] kind of so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] happy for you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and yeah it was like it was like it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like one of the best decisions i think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> regarding my wedding because i got to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> see so much my wedding that i wouldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have got to see if uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if if i did if i didn't have a gopro </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there so yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unfortunately you guys are never going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to see that uh but uh it does it does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> exist on my hard drive oh yeah yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like i said fantastic day you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i know it's a cliche to say like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know your wedding's like the happiest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> day of your life but it was it was top </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like no one's that jaded where they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah my wedding was all right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like of course i mean i live it up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like before the wedding i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like you know maybe it'll be the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> happiest day of my life you know it's i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't really think about it too much </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> i was like drinking every day in london </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right because of course you do yep you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know meeting up catching up with a bunch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of people so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the morning of the wedding yeah as i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taking my suit out i realized i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> have suit shoes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the only pair of shoes i had were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the vessies that i was wearing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i rocked up to the wedding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in full suit you know type in belt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> everything yeah and a pair of vessies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and uh everyone at the wedding was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> giving me [ __ ] they were like they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were literally doing the water </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you know fully deserved mind you but um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know what at the end of the day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i won because when i got onto that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] dance floor dude i was fully </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> prepared </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was fully prepared with my everyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like had taken their shoes off to dance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like step aside i got the footwear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for you yeah yeah yeah yeah so that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> uh don't do that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bring bring it bring bring proper sushi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i had one job to buy sutures and i did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not fulfill it making it making a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> statement there making a statement </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly i was making a statement yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but i guess like you know wedding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> aside it was like i guess it was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reasonable amount of time in the uk you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel like you got to experience more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the uk this time as well yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> absolutely yeah i mean last time i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in the uk which was the first time was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we were staying mostly at your place in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brighton yeah so i think we were only in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> london for maybe like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two days yeah even then it was mostly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just like going to all of the you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> touristy places yeah right so i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah this time around not only did i get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to have like a proper </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like view of london london yeah but also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> chris took me out of london as well to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like we went filming into a bunch of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> places and i actually got to see like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the countryside of london i got to see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stonehenge oh did you actually yeah we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went to stone edge it's really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> disappointing isn't it yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it looks way cooler from a disney yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because you actually get so to get to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stonehenge you have to like go to this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> visitor's center buy a ticket for some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] reason yeah and then you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> either take a bus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like five minutes to stonehenge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> or you can walk across the fields for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like 30 minutes yeah and i was like well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's kind of a nice day let's just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> walk across the fields because it might </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> be nice yeah it was not nice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was not only nothing for 30 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes but there was also just horse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] everywhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> so i'm like [ __ ] dodging these like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know these [ __ ] horse this horse </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] because god forbid these are the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> only pair of [ __ ] shoes i have as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well so i don't want your besties i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wearing the besties </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no i have to wear these things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so we got to it and then i guess because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was like an incident uh some years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> ago of like some drawing you know uh you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know [ __ ] on the stone hair stones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so they had actually like fenced it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> off yeah but like they had fenced it off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not really like an arms reach away but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like at least about a hundred meters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> away yeah so the closest you could get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to stonehenge was like 100 meters away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was kind of like defeating the purpose i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guess like because apparently you used </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be able to like actually walk into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stonehenge and like actually get like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> close view of it you can't do that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anymore because i guess some people just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ruined it for everyone so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which you know was like kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> underwhelming i guess in a sense but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know i was like well you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stonehenge is like that one uh heritage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> site that you hear people talking about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's like a hot tourist place so i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like well you know what at least </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> now i can say that i've seen stonehenge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fascinating it necessarily not really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i'd go to a greg's any day over </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> stonehenge yeah i mean we did afterwards </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> we went to greg's afters but like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> think the most enjoyment i had like on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that trip out of london was the fact </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that like i just actually got to see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the real side of the uk like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> actual like country side like we went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> past like all these like really small </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like quaint little villages that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like there were some villages that we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drove past that legitimately looked like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rpgs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was it was like an rpg like medieval </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> town </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> which was like so [ __ ] cool most of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the uk right but like i had never seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that before right because my experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of the uk is london and brighton right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which is very much not like that yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it was really cool to actually like stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> by in like these really small quaint </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> villages to be like oh we got like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> full experience of the uk what are the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> best one of the best [ __ ] stories </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was we stopped by uh i had i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dying for a piss right right and so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like we have to stop by somewhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah and but like we're in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> middle of nowhere right so we're like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> okay i guess we'll just like stop by the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> closest village to see if there's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an establishment right we can borrow um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so we stopped by this village i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even remember the name of this village </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's [ __ ] tiny and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we got to the entrance of the village </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's like this old dude standing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there and he like kind of flags us down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like hey yeah and so chris is like all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right this uh what what's what's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> happening and we drive up to him and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's like yeah what's what's the problem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the guy goes are you here to see the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> duck race </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we're like what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like there's a duck race happening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so make sure to drive nice and slowly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> across this road okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a dark race </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and sure enough we dr we drive maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about 50 meters and there's just this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gathering of about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 10 to 20 like old people just watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> these ducks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that sounds awesome and i'm like this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most british thing i've ever seen in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> my [ __ ] life what else are you going </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> to do with your free time yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was like i want to be there yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> at that age i want to just like wake up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the morning and be like oh the duck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> races today and just go down to my local </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pond </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and just watch some ducks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's [ __ ] awesome yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's cause like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i remember like as like we went to a pub </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the day for a wedding yeah um and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's very very quaint local pub uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in this very very small town yeah um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because this this like where the wedding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> took place it was in a town that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know you could walk from one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> end to the other in about like 30 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it was a [ __ ] tiny so it was like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> local pub and like i remember there was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just this poster on the wall that just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> said uh this is the place for the uh the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worldwide annual pea tossing tournament </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like that oh yeah well it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> was the p flicking tournament right well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> i think it's the way that the streets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had kind of uh the way like that natural </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> landscape was yeah the idea was that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> threw at the peak because i googled it i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was curious you're gonna throw the p i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean this is gonna tell him wherever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> your wedding is by the way it's only in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this place i mean i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i already have one wedding yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so so the way that this kind of town is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really cool architecture it's like kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like there's a village at the top and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then it kind of winds down towards the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bottom so the idea of this pea throwing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> thing apparently according to google is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it the idea is that you throw it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hopefully if you throw it well enough or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of lucky it'll kind of bounce </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around the walls and kind of go all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way down oh my people will like follow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it and and makes and see where it like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it goes which i think that sounds pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] fun that sounds [ __ ] fun it's </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> like the true </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> british experience right right it was it </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i've never seen like you know you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know there's always like the image of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how americans think british people speak </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like for the first time sydney's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> family got like the true british </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> experience right right right they they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got true local brits and i remember they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were having like they were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was this one kid having a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> conversation with sydney's brother </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and of course he was talking about his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] rap career that was that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> going to take off in new w in america </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> because he had listeners from new york </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and he had like a spotify account yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and i could i could see sydney's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> brother's face just like i know you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> speaking english </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> but i have no idea what the [ __ ] you are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was literally like a scene out of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in-betweeners right like yeah maylene's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> husband marky had the exact same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experience when i like took him to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> friend's house yeah yeah yeah and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my because my friends in london they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not originally from london they're from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like further up north right so they have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the more northerner accent and uh and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> one of my friends yusuf uh he has like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really strong leeds accent right which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hard even for me yeah yeah to understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes so it was just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hilarious every time uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yusuf like opened his mouth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just said something yeah just monkey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> squint like this like he's like really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to [ __ ] close </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he's like this is definitely english </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know and every time yusuf would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stop talking i would turn to maki in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese i'd be like did you understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that he was like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then he got really sad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and he was like i thought i was good at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> english </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i guess i'm not and i'm like don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> worry don't worry about it it's fine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like this is like even i have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> trouble with this thing yeah that should </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> be on like the toeic exam it should be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like can you understand a man from leeds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> if you can you're fluent right yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty much you're good to go yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's funny because like if the more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> northern you go the harder time it gets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like anyone outside of the uk to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> understand what the [ __ ] is being said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly yeah because even for me as like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of southerner i can barely understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what's being said in like liverpool oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah op being from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> the north it's like you just understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone yeah that's right i'm like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> super chill it's all good lucky the only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time i struggle is like i think there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a really uh i felt ashamed at this one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> point there's i think there's a clip of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a really really rural irish uh pub and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then they interviewed is that the guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> with like the three teeth i think so and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> he just [ __ ] says [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i was like even at that point i'm like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> only understood like three words it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the guy from kalani or something it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> might be something but like that was the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> only time where i'm like yeah i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even know if if if the other people in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the pub understood him i i don't know if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm the one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but the interviewer understood him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because he's from that point that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah so he was like he the guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> would just be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and be like yes i like this pub too </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you're conversing with this guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i wish i understood that anytime i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> felt like inadequate i was like yeah i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> thought i understood everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> everything [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i know the exact video you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> talking about as well because like i i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> felt disappointed as well because i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like i'm like i'm sure i can understand </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this i'm sure i can understand this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah don't know you just start uh you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you like start playing at like 4.5 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> speeding like maybe i can like gauge the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> system </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the closed captions just say [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't even think the closed captioning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> can determine if it's english or not i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wish it was like a tv ad one so they'd </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> have to have that like woman who like uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> does the uh sign language sign language </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> she's trying to do the shot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> she's just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> i give up dude </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do they have like strong accents in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> whales like to the point where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> maybe nothing you wouldn't be able to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> understand just a very like oh i'm from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this village you know we talked about is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> there like differing like geographical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> differences in whales like the uk or is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it kind of just like um yeah stronger or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> weaker i generally like the more north </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> west you go uh i heard some [ __ ] do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the thing about that yeah uh it gets a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> little stronger the south has a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> different accent but it's not like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> completely i wouldn't say it's that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> different but they also have different </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> words yeah so i feel like the difference </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is not so much in the dialect more so in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh well not the dialect is the written </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> word yeah the accent isn't as different </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just the words yeah so the accent sounds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> very similar with both but you get the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> more traditional welsh accent that you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> might hear in movies and stuff from the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> south yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's more of a dialect difference than a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> pronunciation yeah yeah the the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> dialect's pretty similar i mean it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basically it's like translation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so it's like japan yeah yeah i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's because there's like the the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] history is so uh different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> between the north and the south yeah the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> south was like conquered by england for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a really long time and then north wasn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so yeah it's way more welsh up north and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> then it's it's you [ __ ] know you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> watched villain saga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> just like they they lightly touch it a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> little bit i'm jealous because australia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't have that at all and i always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought it was really cool because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know american like the uk it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh you can immediately tell where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> someone is from yeah yeah but in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> australia we don't have that at all yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i really love the history of it but like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> no one gives a [ __ ] so it's really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> boring to talk about it and i i don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> want to talk about it if people are like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like [ __ ] resident sleeper </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> they're like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like yeah but video is pretty good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a [ __ ] mess it's pretty cool </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> though at least you got an anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> surrounding around and right right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> and you got one of the most about if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you've got england but at least we had a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> scholar yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> you got one of the most badass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> characters in all of anime man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we got is [ __ ] five minutes in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> hetalia episode </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_04> when i did watch the free movie and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> saw sydney station i was like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> let's go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think the most representation i've had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just like one guy from yuri on ice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's that's it that was that no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what about the chaon movie that was set </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in the uk right now i'm talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thailand thailand oh thailand yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah like we had a one thai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> ice skater in yuri and ice and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember when i went to like there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a big anime chain in japan called </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like animate yeah so we have an anime in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> bangkok yeah and like they had like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] there were there was just like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one cardboard cutout of that one thai </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> ice skater from yuri and ice i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know it's just like we did it boys </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> badass anime characters as well that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty cool yeah he's definitely up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> there and not because he's well that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> might have bumped him up a few weeks we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just got like racially profiled by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> hetalia character </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> he sold me on wales yeah there's a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of really cool areas it's just like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like you can't drop up yeah like if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you just rock up without researching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where to go yeah you're gonna be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where the f where the [ __ ] is everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what is there to do like where am i if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what you're going for there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some amazing hiking spots really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> beautiful nature parks uh like a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the north uh brecken beacons area is all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like nature reserves like nothing's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> built there it's just just go hike </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> having a great time oh broken breakers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is really good yeah yeah yeah um and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah snowdonia uh snowden snow snowdonia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> snowdonia so that sounds like a place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from like game of thrones yeah that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like a pokemon series yeah i mean chris </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> has been up here yeah that's good uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> there's yeah there's a bunch of cool uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seaside stuff that you can go to but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like yeah it depends yeah yeah you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> really have to research because like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> when you hear about people visiting the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> uk obviously there is like english </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> islands yeah yeah and people are like oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> i [ __ ] love going to ireland because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like every [ __ ] fifth person here in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> america is apparently like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like half irish or some [ __ ] right but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you also hear people talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like yes scotland </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i think it really helps for the uk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> countries like okay you have london and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then you can branch out you have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> scotland then you can branch out you've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got dublin then you can branch out it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you have card </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> even then cardiff is really far from all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the nature stuff like yeah it's kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> weird in the u in wales where if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to kind of travel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> via public transport up north you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go around and back up you don't you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> don't go you can't just go through the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> middle so if you go if you've got that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like a lot of mountains or oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah there's a lot of mountains and it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't make sense to build the trains </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there because it kind of connects </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> through england right and it goes back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in just like shrewsbury and stuff yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so if you go really far west and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just going on off on it's kind of really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> annoying to get back up so if you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> going westward you plan your whole trip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to go west and then you go back right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's kind of annoying to go back up like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can if you want to go to like abba </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> dust with but that's no aberration is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> down south we're saying no no that's a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> tower there's so many fights </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's all it's all weird it's a really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> cool place if you plan your trip it'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> be cool </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah there's again there's some amazing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff you got to show us around because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i've never had like a guide for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> whales yes basically you have to bear in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mind my my experience with wales was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when i was like young and a kid so if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like a show me whales and i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you yeah but i'm going to be like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for australia yeah yeah sure like like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> my view of sydney is going to be very </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> different </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the average tourism yeah i think because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> all my tourism was done in the confines </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of like school trips and stuff yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like very like warped yeah what i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually would think would be fun my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> parents know that my parents love doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it they they like they're doing this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing where they go all around wales </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like by walking right not in one go it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like in trips right right so they do a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> section and they go back and then they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> do another section and then they go back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> it's cool it's [ __ ] insane </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> my parents love walking yeah and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> exercising i wish that rubbed off on me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like where's the clown i've got the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> bare minimum of wanting to walk and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> stuff yeah but uh yeah if you if you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> interested in like really convoluted and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> complex history yeah you might want to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> look into it it's kind of cool yeah it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just about people trying to not be taken </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> over by the english for like 400 years </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they fail more history more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> history than what we've got dude it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty like pretty much every country on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> in like the uk right i think they did a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pretty good job look at the rest of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> world they didn't last very long against </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> england i think we did pretty good uh we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> had a pretty good run </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's pretty good right sir </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but i mean it's cool there's some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really funny history moments of i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've ever told that i've told that story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before about the castle like it took </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> over yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] loved that story yeah it's so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] funny i wish we had like fun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> stories like that yeah like we don't we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know we didn't have any of that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] yeah we're just like yeah a bunch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of convicts was just like [ __ ] you uk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we just started our own country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh yeah just a whole lot of uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> racism and politics yeah yeah it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's like it's because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when sydney's family were visiting like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you take for granted just how much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> history the uk has yeah because you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could you could show that like i i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> showing them just like even just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> seeing even them just seeing like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> buildings yeah pubs that were just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really old </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's like fast that was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fascinating yeah many churches in the uk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> have been around since uh over 1400 </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> years yeah like there's a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> churches that are still like built in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> eight eight hundred like this is just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> insane yeah they're still there it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> crazy and it's like we take for granted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just having like a country with like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> history in it whereas like i think if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like over 25 or something in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> america then you've like been alive for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a tenth of the entire country's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> history yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your entire country's age and that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] that just [ __ ] blows my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> mind you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that there's a country that that is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> young but then you get you run into the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> issue of like okay i want to learn about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uk history where do i start and then you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> go with the highlights but then when you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> start digging into stuff you're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is really [ __ ] convoluted right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay so they took over and then another </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guy took over and then another guy took </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> over and then england got taken over by </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> vikings and then now it's the french </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's convoluted but it's super </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] fascinating if you're into that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] right that's what makes it even </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cooler that all like some of these </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> churches and stuff have lasted like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> being taken over like 10 different times </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah right like it's like how the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> did this it's the exact same thing with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like japanese history as well yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's what makes it so fascinating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> for history like fanatics right but it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know [ __ ] yeah australia's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even 250 years old yeah we [ __ ] were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> founded in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 1777 i think 78 yeah yeah which is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] like the uk had like already </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> figured this [ __ ] out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we were just like oh what the [ __ ] do we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a lot of modern like a lot of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> countries that we know today and we're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like super used to like i'm very new </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i think finland is only like 100 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> years old yeah oh germany yeah yeah like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to think that germany like was like like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a completely different [ __ ] thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah like because we've been alive our </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whole life i mean our whole life is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> angela merkel like it's so weird when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like these countries are not like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> they weren't a thing yeah i don't think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> germany want to talk about that yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> they don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> actually they do talk about it a lot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're like be ashamed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't know how we got onto countries </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or whatever the [ __ ] but i mean i love </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> talking about history and countries i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] i'm obsessed with history i love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it so much yeah and uh but there's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> too much to learn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i just that's just too much i gotta pick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> an era you know like i i get so jealous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i meet people who are like dude i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] love the byzantine era and i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] dude that's just like i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've heard of that from age vampires </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like it's like i feel like i'm a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> history buff but then someone talks to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> me about like ancient rome and egypt </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah like [ __ ] i wish i had like i wish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that was the stuff i was really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interested yeah i just loved like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> past 1000 years </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> even though that's pushing it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i love like the ancient stuff you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah but then you feel like is your </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> history more better </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is your history </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like is it more significant because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like the romans yeah okay dude that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of that's kind of [ __ ] sick yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can't you can't go up against it </SPEAKER_06>
